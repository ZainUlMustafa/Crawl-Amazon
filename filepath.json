            "Overall this is a great fitness watch.  It has a range of activies to choose from including run, walk, strength, cardio, (pool) swim (I think you'd need a higher spec for ocean swim), yoga, pilates and many more!It's easy to access all the menus using buttons on the side of the watch or swiping the watch face.The watch links seemlessly to your smartphone via the Garmin Connect app where you can upload all of your workouts and monitor progress at a glance.  You can track your goals, monitor heartrate and stress levels and you can even sign up for a personlised coach to take you to your first 5km, 10km or half marathon.The watch is lightweight and looks good enough that you could wear it all day.  It has a range of features designed to negate the need for carrying cards/ phone, like Garmin Pay - add bank cards to the Garmin Connect app and away you go!The watch also has the capacity to upload about 500 songs using Spotify, Amazon or other music apps and listen to them via bluetooth headphones. With phones getting bigger & heavier, who wants to carry them on your walk / run??The main reason I gave it 4 stars, not 5 was due to how hard it was to sort out the music.After synching my Spotify playlist + bluetooth headphones, I did a trial and every time I started the running app, my headphones disconnected!  After about 20 attempts and a lot of Google searching, I was able to remedy the issue, but it involved a full reset.  GRR!In my case it's because the headphones actually have a heartrate monitor in them and this was interfering with the watch's HRM.  If you have standard bluetooth earbuds, you might not have this issue.Now that I've got everything working, it really is a great watch that I enjoy using and I would highly recommend it.The price point makes it a lot more affordable than some other smart watches with similar features.",
            "Beautiful looking display, but boy where's the rest of it? There's a 3mm ring of black nothing around the tiny 31mm display wasted. My old Ticwatch E (on the left in photo) is the same size watch, but it's display is much bigger.I haven't used much of the software yet, but I'm not mad on the GUI (Graphical User Interface). Thinking of returning it due to the display. Doesn't connect to my Oppo Find X2 Pro either.",
            "The watch gives enough data with much better accuracy to track my daily activities and health status. The stress, sleep, and heart metrics have a higher accuracy rate.  It gives you the trend which can be interpreted according to individual.The battery life is awesome. I charge only once a week.Garmin Connect app could have a bit better.Overall this is a perfect daily use alternate smartwatch for Apple & FitBit. I loved it.",
            "I bought this to monitor my sleep apart from normal activities, after a month use, I can recommend it to others. Initially, the body battery was going a bit unusual but it improved itself with time. Watch size is good for thin wrists as well. In Australia, the product price was too much so I bought it from Amazon Uk with a very competitive price, but I had to wait for a couple of week for the delivery, so be ready to wait a long time if you order from outside Australia. Lastly, the battery life is around 5-6 days, but if you use it to listen to music then get ready to charge it frequently. Overall a very good fitness watch.",
            "Functions well (3rd day), power runs down quicker than expected, but probably would last six days, if not using it.  If you don't look at the screen the power will last longer.  Easily connected with my phone.  I was able to connect with my speed/cadence on my bike with no problems.  Also used in the pool for swimming.",
            "Really think that Garmin has a good product in the Venu.  I understand the battery life has also been improved on the Venu 2 - which from my perspective in using the Venu now for a few weeks is a necessary thing!  Love the music and Pay functions but have reservations with use of the Golf function.  This is perhaps the only let down point as the Golf shot tracking is overly sensitive and logs shots of 0 metres on just about every hole.  These can be deleted later on with editing - but as I'm tracking shots and club distances - this is now impacting on accuracy of measurements.  Hope this can be fixed with software tweak??  Garmin??  Other than this \"First World\" issue - a great all around activity tracking smart watch!",
            "I had a Fitbit before this. Sleep monitoring is terrible in comparison - no idea when I\u2019m awake vs light sleep. I\u2019ll need to read instructions to do anything other than view data, it\u2019s not especially intuitive. GPS takes a while to load before exercise and today it didn\u2019t even know where I was, came up with a route I didn\u2019t take! I suspect distance, pace, steps and VO2max more accurate than FitBit though - they are more conservative. Not unhappy with it, but not as happy as I expected to be \u2018upgrading\u2019 from a 3-4 year old Fitbit.",
            "I wanted to love this watch as I was upgrading from a previous model. However I ended up getting a faulty unit because whenever I charged the watch as soon as it came off the charger it went dead. Every single time. It would then take me 20-30 minutes of trying multiple reset to get it to turn back on. I put up with it for almost a month until I finally have up and sent it back.",
            "I am an ex Samsung Smart watch user. I recently switched to Garmin after my Samsung died out.  I bought this watch 1 and half week ago. I charged the watch as soon as I received it.  After fully charged the battery lasted for 7 days.  Compare this to the Samsung watch which needed charging every single day. The watch does everything a smart watch does and I am very pleased with it.I am in love with my new watch.",
            "Have been using this Venu SQ Garmin for the last 3 months - it is an awesome health and fitness tracker but I do feel it can improve slightly on tracking sleep - but everything else is really great!",
            "I have moved from a fairly simple Fitbit Charge 2 watch to this one, so I had great expectations. Being a golfer the golf app was something I was keen to use and was not disappointed. I am just starting to get a full understanding of how this watch works, but for now I'm very happy with it.",
            "I bought this watch to replace a Samsung Active2 watch. The Samsung was very stylish but HR was inaccurate and it doesn't measure spo2. The Garmin has worked perfectly. The app is not as good as STEALTH, but overall I much prefer the Garmin.",
            "The watch was really good but the screen stopped working in less than a month. Had to return it and buy a another one.",
            "We bough this for my boss who has increased her fitness last year for her to track her workouts and reach her goals.  She absolutely loves it and recommends it to anyone looking for a product like this.",
            "Brought it as a birthday present my wife loves the look and functionality and know doesn't know what it was like with out it.",
            "I love my new watch. It provides me with all I data I need to track my goals, gains and health. Excellent cost vs benefits.",
            "Looks great and my husbands now has no reason to complain that he is tired as watch shows \u2018sleep scores\u2019. Pretty amazing.",
            "Bought the  Garmin for my wife.. We both had Polar sport watches, which kept failing to charge..My wife loves her new Garmin.  No complaints at all. !",
            "It does everything as advertised. Great for the price. The OLED screen is nice. Battery lasts about two days.",
            "Looks good on the website site but the software is like a toy watch. Disappointed purchase.",
            "bought for my better half for Christmas, she has nothing but praise, cannot fault it.",
            "It's amazing very happy.",
            "Wonderful product and very accurate description",
            "buttons would not work!!!!",
            "no",
            "Value for money. Working excellent",
            "I owned several watches and this is my favourite. I owned a FitBit, a Polar Ignite an Apple Watch Series 3 and now this.This Garmin is a fitness tracker with some smart watch features. It does what a fitness tracker tends to do, i.e., track steps, heart rate, distance travelled and has GPS so you don\u2019t need to bring the phone with you. It has some extra tracking features like stress tracking and period tracking. I am going to make a quick comparison with the other watches.Sleep tracking. For me the FitBit, Apple Watch and Polar Ignite all had better sleep tracking. The Garmin Venu SQ has issues with detecting when you wake up and when you fall asleep. There was a night where I got up for a few minutes and the Garmin did not register that as being awake. It might be a fit issue as sometimes it\u2019s more accurate than others.So Garmin Venu Sq loses on the sleep tracking.Sport Tracking.It\u2019s almost on par with the Ignite. You can view your training load with the Ignite (on the Polar website), whereas with the Garmin you can\u2019t. Although it shows you your weekly average of activity, albeit it isn\u2019t quite the same thing. Garmin has a few built-in walking/running/cycling challenges, akin to those of Strava, which the Ignite does not have. I haven\u2019t used the coaching features on the watches so I can\u2019t comment as I find them limiting and they are good for generic strength training or running. I follow my own programs.The Garmin app lets you make a note of exercises and reps, although if an exercise is missing you can\u2019t add it to the app.The Garmin app notifies you with insights, like how many times you have hit your step goal, and it has a function to increase it automatically if you wish to. It also gives you badges for hitting activity milestones, which is more similar to what the Apple Watch does. They both attempt to gamify exercise somewhat whereas the Polar is serious business. The FitBit has activity and step tracking, but trying to view your routes is hidden behind a subscription. For the other Watches you don\u2019t pay any extra for this.The Apple Watch default fitness app lets you track distance, steps, heart rate like the other watches and also offers trend insights. No built-in training load like this Garmin.Garmin Venu SW sport tracking is pretty good. It depends on what you look for in your sport tracking, but if training load is essential (without having to pay for third party apps), then the Ignite just inches ahead.\u201cHealth Tracking\u201dI put it in quotes because all these watch companies add these features and then say they are not health features. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) tracking is done differently on all these devices.I prefer the Garmin and the Polar way. Polar tracks your HRV overnight and tells you if you are recovered the next day (together with sleep data). Garmin does it throughout the day, through a system called Body Battery. It uses HRV with other information to tell you whether you are stressed (physiologically or mentally) or whether you are resting during the day. It was able to detect when I was highly stressed after an argument and even sent me an alert in that case. It makes you aware of correlations between how you feel and what you did that might have caused it.For example, I had an ice cream fairly late in the evening. I thought I slept okay because I didn\u2019t remember waking up but I didn\u2019t feel rested. When I looked at the Body Battery I noticed that it wasn\u2019t until 3/4 am that my body had actually started recovering. Given that I didn\u2019t fall asleep any later than usual I wouldn\u2019t have made the connection with the ice cream, but we ain\u2019t having that in the evening anymore.HRV tracking on the FitBit requires subscription.HRV Tracking on the Apple Watch is not reliable. It tries to take readings when it sees you are relaxed or sleeping, an they are very short samples. With 3rd party apps and the use of Apple\u2019s own Breathe app you can force readings and analyse them properly, but the Apple Watch at the moment is just a bit lacklustre in this department.So for HRV Polar and Garmin are a tie and the approach you have to HRV will be the deciding factor on who wins.Cycle tracking. They all do it quite well aside from the Ignite, which doesn\u2019t have it at all. It\u2019s quite a big omission for women, as it absolutely influences the way I train. It\u2019s one of the main drivers of how I feel through the month. The Garmin also lets you add some extra notes, and not just some preset symptoms. so Garmin Venu Sq wins this one.Food TrackingFitBit wins this one as it has food tracking built in.Polar Ignite does not have it at all.Both Garmin Venu Sq and Apple Watch require and integrate with third party apps. The Venu however only works with MyFitnessPal.Pulse OximetryThe Apple Watch Series 3 and the Ignite don\u2019t have it. The FitBit Versa 3 (which is of comparable price if I recall correctly) has it and so does this Garmin. That said, pulse ox on watches are unreliable, so you might as well not use it.Battery LifeFitBit and Garmin have similar battery life. Up to 5/6 days. The Ignite has around 3 1/2 and the Apple Watch Series 3 has 18 hours. I really love not having to charge my Garmin every day.Smart Watch FeaturesThe Apple Watch here wins by a mile. Many apps, granular control over notifications, Siri.Fitbit depends on what you buy, but even the cheap FitBits let you choose which app can send notifications to your phone. I haven\u2019t seen the FitBit app store but I hear it has a limited amount of apps.Garmin Venu Sq has the ability to choose between phone notifications, message notifications and app notifications, but you can\u2019t choose which apps. You can also turn off notifications during activity. It has access to a store but like the FitBit it has limited apps.The Ignite is only a sport watch. No apps and notifications are an all or nothing affair.ScreenI didn\u2019t own a comparable FitBit so I can\u2019t comment. The Apple Watch Screen is my favourite. The Garmin\u2019s screen is decent but smaller. I really do not like the Ignite\u2019s screen, it\u2019s not very responsive.CONCLUSIONSo all in all, the Garmin Venu Sq is a jack of all trade watch that does most things decently and some quite well. The only other watch that has better flexibility is the Apple Watch Series 3, which is slightly more expensive and  has worse battery life. If you don\u2019t have an iPhone the Apple Watch is out of the equation.Given it\u2019s all around capabilities, how good Body Battery is, how the app presents the information in a way that is easy to make correlations and the longer battery life, the Garmin Venu Sq is my choice at this price range and I recommend it. Whilst the FitBit has good \u201chealth\u201d tracking capabilities you have to pay extra for things like HRV tracking, so again the Garmin wins here.",
            "Moin!=========Update=========Soooooo. Wir zwei haben nun eine ganze Weile miteinander verbracht. Sonst habe ich sehr gern meine Samsung Galaxy Watch getragen. Und? Ich habe mehrere Monate komplett drauf verzichtet. Das lag vor allem aber daran, dass mir der Smartwatch-Anteil eine lange Zeit nicht fehlte. Da \u00fcberwog einfach der Wunsch nach einem Fitnesstracker. Der Bereich ist hier f\u00fcr mich auch weiterhin einfach \u00fcberragend. Der Plan zum Joggen passt sich immer wieder individuell an und ist h\u00f6flich zu mir, wenn mich dann doch mal \u00fcber Wochen die Faulheit am Sofa festh\u00e4lt. Erstaunlicherweise funktioniert das Tracken hier tadellos und irgendwie scheinen die Satelliten sonst einen relativ gro\u00dfen Bogen um unser Gebiet zu machen. \ud83d\ude09 Zwischenzeitlich war ich f\u00fcr einige Wochen zu meiner Galaxy Watch zur\u00fcckgekehrt. Warum? Hier ist einfach das Aufladen zu nervig. Man muss dies zwar selten machen, muss dann aber bei bedarf ein Kabel an der R\u00fcckseite reinfriemeln, welches in meinen Augen dazu viel zu kurz ist. Jedes Mal krieche ich daf\u00fcr halb hinters Sofa, da es auf der Armlehne nicht liegen bleiben m\u00f6chte. Mittlerweile bin ich wieder bei der Garmin, das Wetter passt und der Bewegungsdrang ist wieder da.Wer keine Smartwatch sucht, sondern einen Fitnesstracker, der ist hier absolut richtig! Auch nach l\u00e4ngerer Nutzung und so einigen Updates w\u00fcrde ich diese Uhr noch immer nicht als Smartwatch bezeichnen. Nicht sehr smart aber viel watch und noch mehr Fitnesstracker.Urspr\u00fcngliche Rezension:Dies ist nicht meine erste Smartwatch. Recht zu Beginn bin ich 2014 mit der Moto360 von Motorola eingestiegen und dann 2016 auf die Moto360 2nd Gen. umgestiegen. Bei der Motorola war ich von Beginn an sehr begeistert vom Betriebssystem. Die Uhr war zwar nicht sehr eigenst\u00e4ndig, hat jedoch alles gespiegelt, was auf dem Handy passierte. Nur leider hat Motorola nie ein sch\u00f6nes Design geschaffen und so bin ich dann 2018 auf die Samsung Galaxy Watch umgestiegen. Hier gabs dann eine wirklich gro\u00dfartige Optik, aber eine sehr begrenzte Funktionalit\u00e4t als Spiegel des Handys. Die Abteilung Sport war bei der Galaxy Watch schon recht ausgepr\u00e4gt, nur leider hatte die Uhr bei mir beim Joggen immer Probleme mit dem GPS. Und nun? Eine Smartwatch von Garmin, die schon in der Werbung ein brillantes Display verspricht und noch dazu aussieht wie eine normale Uhr? Na dann mal los! \ud83d\ude09Diese Rezension wird vorlaufend weiterentwickelt, da die Uhr erst mit der Zeit zeigen wird, was sie alles kann.=========Design=========Die Uhr hat ein recht schlichtes Design und erinnert mich stark an die Samsung Galaxy Watch. Sie besteht komplett aus Plastik und hat eine optisch abgesetzte L\u00fcnette. Das Display ist leicht erhaben, was in meinen Augen der Garant daf\u00fcr ist, dass man damit fr\u00fcher oder sp\u00e4ter irgendwo h\u00e4ngen bleibt und so ein Sprung droht. Ich habe mir jedoch bereits eine Schutzfolie bestellt und hoffe, dass so Schlimmeres verhindert wird. Das mitgelieferte Armband ist aus Gummi und riecht recht stark, l\u00e4sst sich jedoch sehr simpel gegen ein anderes Armband tauschen. Rechts am Geh\u00e4use befinden sich zwei Kn\u00f6pfe.Im Vergleich zu anderen Smartwatches ist dieses Model doch recht leicht.=========Features=========Direkt von Anfang an zeigt sich, wof\u00fcr diese Uhr eigentlich gedacht ist. F\u00fcr mich zeigt sich diese Smartwatch weniger als Smartwatch, denn eher als Fitnesstracker. Es mag sein, dass ich in den Einstellungen noch nicht das Richtige gefunden habe, aber die Benachrichtigung vom Handy funktioniert entweder stark verz\u00f6gert oder gar nicht.-Wecker \u2013 Ich habe einen leichten Schlaf und habe mich bei meiner Galaxy Watch daran gew\u00f6hnt, mich lediglich mittels Vibrationsalarm morgens wecken zu lassen. Dies funktioniert auch mit diesem Model wirklich gro\u00dfartig.-Werte im Alltag checken \u2013 Die Uhr konzentriert sich den ganzen Tag auf meine Bewegungsabl\u00e4ufe, Puls, gelaufene Schritte und lustigerweise auch mein Stresslevel. Erstaunlicherweise macht sie das auch wirklich gut. So bekam ich in einer mehr als nervenaufreibenden Vorlesung pl\u00f6tzlich die Info \u201eIhr Stresslevel ist zu hoch\u201c. Das spiegelte in dem Moment genau mein Gef\u00fchl wieder! \ud83d\ude09-Sport \u2013 Das werde ich die Tage auf jeden Fall testen. Bei schlechtem Wetter finde ich einfach zu viele Ausreden.=========Funktionalit\u00e4t=========Der Akku macht bislang einen sehr guten Eindruck. Nicht wie bei anderen Smartwatches, muss diese Uhr nicht jeden Abend auf die Station. Da sind wir aber schon bei einem Problem. Statt die Uhr einfach auf eine Ladestation zu legen, darf man bei diesem Ger\u00e4t einen Stecker in die Uhr frickeln, in meinen Augen nicht sehr zeitgem\u00e4\u00df, das geht auf jeden Fall besser!Des Weiteren zeigt diese Uhr teilweise eine doch recht schwache Performance.  Die Smartwatch verliert immer wieder die Verbindung zum Handy oder es wird mir auf dem Handy eine Fehlermeldung angezeigt, dass die Android Benachrichtigung beendet wurde, was jedes Mal den Neustart meines Handys verlangt. Auch scheint der RAM-Speicher bei dieser Uhr nicht ausreichend zu sein, so wirkt die Bedienung oft ruckelig und es treten Latenzprobleme auf. Das Touchdisplay ist nicht sehr sensibel und so darf man \u00f6fter mehrmals wischen, ehe man das gew\u00fcnschte Ergebnis erzielt. Ein kleiner Tipp am Rande. Nicht die App \u201eSleep with Android\u201c runterladen. Bei dieser App st\u00fcrzt bei mir die Uhr jedes Mal ab und w\u00fcnscht einen Neustart.Alles in Allem ist die Men\u00fcf\u00fchrung nicht sehr intuitiv, nicht innovativ und arg ruckelig. Die Smartwatch l\u00e4uft ordentlich, da ist jedoch noch sehr viel Luft nach Oben.Ich hoffe, meine Rezension war Ihnen behilflich. \ud83d\ude0a Vielen Dank f\u00fcr's Lesen.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0Questa \u00e8 la mia prima esperienza con Garmin, ho avuto in passato sempre altri smart e sportwatch, (fitbit, huawei, huami, amazfit e xiaomi) e questo Venu SQ \u00e8 stata una bella sorpresa.Avevo bisogno di un prodotto che monitorasse la corsa in modo efficace e questo smartwatch \u00e8 perfetto sotto ogni punto di vista senza dover spendere un capitale. Premetto quindi che questa mia recensione tiene in considerazione solo la corsa e non gli altri sport.Elencher\u00f2 in modo sintetico cosa mi \u00e8 piaciuto e cosa no:\u2705 E' molto elegante, abbastanza discreto, sta bene su qualsiasi polso ed \u00e8 talmente leggero che non ci si accorge di averlo al polso. Utilizzato anche per dormire non da assolutamente fastidio.\u2705 Il display sfrutta la tecnologia LCD, ha una risoluzione di 240x240 px e non ha always on. Pensavo che questo sarebbe stato un problema ed invece lo schermo si vede benissimo in qualsiasi condizione, sembra di avere uno schermo oled, e la gesture per l'attivazione dello schermo \u00e8 precisa, non sbaglia mai un colpo, veramente ottimo !!! Anche se lo schermo \u00e8 piccolo rispetto ad altri smartwatch che ho avuto in passato si vede tutto benissimo.\u2705 Il sensore cardio \u00e8 molto preciso e legge in modo veloce le variazioni, cosa estremamente utile nello sport. E' possibile impostare una lettura H24 con modalit\u00e0 intelligente oppure continua (ogni secondo). Queste impostazioni possono essere settate o da app oppure direttamente nell'orologio. E' possibile impostare degli avvisi di frequenza alta o bassa durante l'attivit\u00e0 e anche durante la giornata intera. E' possibile disattivare il monitoraggio cardio H24.\u2705 Ha lettura dell'ossigenazione del sangue, SpO2, che pu\u00f2 essere monitorata durante tutta la giornata oppure solo durante il sonno, oppure pu\u00f2 essere disattivata e quindi la lettura pu\u00f2 essere effettuata manualmente.\u2705 Il sensore GPS e veloce e preciso. Si pu\u00f2 scegliere solo GPS, GPS + Glonass oppure GPS + Galileo. Tramite queste opzioni la triangolazione e quindi la traccia ottenuta \u00e8 precisa e l'aggancio al satellite avviene in max 7 secondi.\u2705 Il monitoraggio della corsa \u00e8 pressoch\u00e9 perfetto. Vi sono moltissime opzioni e parametri, \u00e8 possibile aggiungere dei campi dati alla corsa, ogni schermata pu\u00f2 essere modificata con i dati a proprio piacimento, c'\u00e8 l'auto pausa, a corsa avviata \u00e8 possibile modificare determinati parametri, insomma c'\u00e8 tutto l'occorrente per anche il pi\u00f9 esigente degli utenti. Fantastico !\u2705 E' presente anche un sistema di sicurezza di rilevazione incidenti, quindi se avviene una caduta viene mandato un messaggio di emergenza con la posizione GPS a determinati contatti preimpostati nell'app sul telefono. Ovvio che per usufruire di questa opzione \u00e8 necessario avere con se il telefono.\u2705 E' possibile avviare un live track dell'attivit\u00e0 sportiva svolta e condividerla con i propri contatti. In questo modo da remoto il vostro contatto potr\u00e0 visualizzare in tempo reale la vostra attivit\u00e0. Anche in questo caso \u00e8 necessario avere con se il telefono.\u2705 Finalmente uno smartwatch che opera veramente in multitasking. Se fate partire un'attivit\u00e0, tramite swipe a sisnitra, potrete tornare alla home e da li avere accesso a tutto i parametri, widget, app, ecc. dello smartwatch. La vostra attivit\u00e0 rimarr\u00e0 attiva in background. Potete inoltre ricevere anche ad attivit\u00e0 avviata tutte le notifiche, impostazione settabile a proprio piacimento.\u2705 Cosa da non sottovalutare, questo smartwatch \u00e8 affidabile ! Il software non si incarta, non lagga, il sistema operativo \u00e8 ben studiato, funziona tutto alla grande.\u2705 Il punto forte di questo e di tutti i prodotti garmin \u00e8 il software. Il migliore fino ad ora provato ! Garmin Connect gestisce in modo perfetto il sync tra orologio e telefono. Notifiche puntuali e precise, tra l'altro \u00e8 possibile rispondere direttamente da orologio tramite messaggi preimpostati, e sync perfetto. L'app \u00e8 veramente completa e ben fatta. E' possibile tramite garmin coach, avere degli allenamenti preimpostati oppure crearne nuovi a proprie esigenze. E' una funziona che non ho testato benissimo, ma \u00e8 un valore aggiunto di non poco conto. Per aggiungere ulteriori funzionalit\u00e0 allo smartwatch, app, widget campi dati e watchface, bisogna scaricare un'altra app, uno store ogni giorno sempre pi\u00f9 aggiornato chiamato Connect IQ, dalla quale \u00e8 possibile aggiungere app e widget allo smartwatch, aggiungere e modificare watchface. Insomma, oltre ad avere un ottimo prodotto al polso \u00e8 fondamentale avere un ottimo software a supporto e a mio avviso da questo punto di vista Garmin non ha rivali.\u2705 Durante la giornata viene monitorato lo stress e quindi viene calcolato il body battery, ovvero un'indicazione della carica energetica del vostro corpo, veramente utile per trovare il miglior periodo della giornata per effettuare un'attivit\u00e0. E' una funzione molto valida e utile, e funziona alla grande !!\u2705 E possibile controllare qualsiasi lettore audio in esecuzione sul telefono, quindi si pu\u00f2 alzare il volume, play / pausa  e skip dei pezzi.\u2705 E' presente Garmin Pay, quindi associata la vostra carta di credito, potrete in tutta sicurezza effettuare pagamenti con il vostro smartwatch sfruttando la funzione contactless (NFC) integrata. Dovrete impostare una passkey che dovrete quindi inserire prima di effettuare il pagamento. Il sistema \u00e8 super sicuro e funziona alla perfezione.\u2705 E' possibile settare sveglie, timer, aumentare o abbassare la luminosit\u00e0 automatica su 3 livelli (c'\u00e8 un sensore automatico della luminosit\u00e0 che lavora in modo estremamente efficace e veloce), \u00e8 possibile disattivare il Bluetooth (cosa non presente su nessun smartwatch che fino ad ora ho provato), ricercare il telefono e tutte le maggiori funzioni presenti in tutti questi device. E' possibile rispondere e/o rifiutare le chiamate in arrivo.\u2705 Il monitoraggio del sonno \u00e8 preciso, vengono calcolati parametri quali sonno profondo, leggero e rem. Viene inoltre calcolato il numero delle volte che si respira ogni minuto (anche di giorno questo avviene), e quanto ci si muove nel letto. Unito al monitoraggio cardio e  dello stress si ha un quadro davvero completo del proprio sonno, molto utile dopo un'attivit\u00e0 o durante un periodo di allenamento intensivo.\u2705 Ogni singola opzione, ad esempio gli avvisi cardio o altre impostazioni  sono attivabili sia dall'app del telefono che direttamente sullo smartwatch. E' possibile inoltre collegare, quindi fare sync e impostare vari settaggi, lo smartwatch al proprio PC, Win e Mac, tramite l'app Garmin Express.\u2705 Se siete super smanettoni Garmin mette a disposizione il pacchetto SDK per poter sviluppare tramite linguaggio prioritario, praticamente simile al C, app, widget, watchface in ambiente Clipper. C'\u00e8 una community molto attiva in tal senso e quindi se vorrete cimentarvi alla creazione troverete un valido supporto e valida documentazione.  La possibilit\u00e0 quindi di poter collegare lo smartwatch al PC \u00e8 fondamentale ed estremamente utile per testare le vostre creazioni, app, watchfaces o widget.\u2705 L'autonomia \u00e8 quella dichiarata. Senza attivit\u00e0 sportiva e quindi solo con notifiche, monitoraggio cardio H24 in modalit\u00e0 smart e senza SpO2 si fanno 6 giorni e mezzo. Con due attivit\u00e0 di 1 ora si arriva a fare 5 giorni. Dipende poi dall'utilizzo, dalla watchface utilizzata (alcune hanno attivit\u00e0 in bagkround che consumano di pi\u00f9). Il calcolo pi\u00f9 o meno \u00e8 un 10% circa di consumo con attivit\u00e0 e opzione GPS+Galileo (solo GPS consuma un 2/3% in meno), e con un'utilizzo medio / intenso il consumo a giornata, incluso sonno, \u00e8 circa un 15/20% giorno (smanettamenti, installare e disinstallare app e un discreto numero di notifiche). La ricarica avviene in modo rapido, quindi in circa 45 minuti si passa da un 15% a un 85%. Insomma l'autonomia non sar\u00e0 un problema.\u2705 E' da circa 3 settimane che ho questo smartwatch ed ho gi\u00e0 ricevuto 3 aggiornamenti software. Viene aggiornato anche il software dei sensori, e del gps. Insomma supporto totale da parte di Garmin.\u2705 Ho avuto molti smartwatch in passato ed ho una discreta esperienza in merito, quindi posso affermare che questo Garmin Venu SQ \u00e8 un prodotto veramente completo sotto ogni punto di vista. Per quanto riguarda la corsa possono essere monitorati molti parametri. A primo impatto pu\u00f2 sembrare difficile e complicato la sua gestione, ci sono 2 app da mettere sul telefono,  i parametri e le opzioni che sono presenti nello smartwatch sono molti, ma dopo qualche giorno vi renderete conto che il tutto in realt\u00e0 \u00e8 molto semplice e super funzionale, molto ben progettato e studiato alla perfezione per poter venire incontro anche all'utente pi\u00f9 esigente. Per le funzionalit\u00e0 che ha e per  la fascia di prezzo che viene proposto  a mio avviso questo \u00e8 il miglior e il pi\u00f9 completo prodotto presente sul mercato !L'unica cosa che non mi \u00e8 piaciuta \u00e8 la lentezza della sincronizzazione tra smartwatch e telefono, ma \u00e8 un dettaglio altamente trascurabile.Se siete quindi alla ricerca di un dispositivo per il monitoraggio dell'attivit\u00e0 sportiva, da non spendere un capitale, questo \u00e8 lo smart/sport watch perfetto. Brava Garmin ! \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00",
            "OverviewI have long been a loyal user of running watches produced by Garmin and my most recent (and previously much loved) watch is this Garmin Vivo Active 3. I have also road tested the Polar Vantage M, the Polar Ignite recently and now this new Garmin Venu. I typically run 50km to 60km per week (combination of trails and on road) and also use the watches for multi-sports such as weight training, spinning etc. My review below contains the detail but in summary I absolutely love this watch, its functionality and its high quality screen are exactly what was needed in this now quite crowded sports/activity tracking watch area. When combined with the Garmin app you really do have a 5* product which will help with monitoring health and performance.Set Up:- You can set up the watch with or without the Garmin App. It is recommended to use the app and therefore I did (I also love analyising my fitness data so a watch which isn\u2019t syncing with an app is no fun for me).- The watch was easy to set up and both the watch and App were intuitive to use.Charging- The watch arrived with 52% battery power. It comes with a USB charger (note: no mains plug, you will either need to charge via a laptop or a mains to USB charger). The watch attaches to the charger via an each magnetic connection.- The watch went from out of box to being 100% charged in less than 1 hour (via mains).- The charger is a small clip in which attaches to the back of the watch. It attaches easily (it is the same connector as the Vivoactive, a watch with which I have had no charging mishaps in the past and therefore seems to be a robust and reliable system).Aesthetics, general wearability and day to day use- The Garmin Venu looks very good on my wrist, it is a nice size for day to day wear (it is slightly deeper than the Vivoactive 3 but the screen size is about the same size).- It is light and as a result it was easy to forget I was wearing it. It is only 46g (3g heavier than the Vivoactive 3)- The strap is soft and pliable (other running watches such as the the cheaper Polar watches have quite stiff straps).Ease of Operation:- The watch is operated largely by touch screen (there are two buttons on the side of the watch, one which starts/stops activities and can be used a a selector button, the other which is mainly used to access the main menu/settings). I really like the intuitive and easy to use touch screen ability \u2013 it feels modern and up to date but more importantly it is very quick to navigate.- To start training you select the top button on the device and then scroll to find the activity you want to start. You can set the watch up so your most frequently used activities are listed up front for a quick start. There are many pre-programmed activities but I have mainly used the running (outdoors), treadmill running, indoor cycling and strength training activities.- The activity is paused by pressing the same button and then the touch screen gives end and save options. I have found that the watch is quicker to start/stop/change activities than the Vivoactive 3 is.GPS log on- There is nothing more frustrating then your watch taking a long time to log onto the GPS signal when you just want to start running, I was concerned about this having read other reviews of this watch.- I had no siginifcant issues with the GPS link up. I have used the watch in a small town, a city, at the start of many races and in the countryside when trail running and the GPS log on was adequate in all locations (usually almost immediate but on rare and more frustrating occasions up to 1 minute).- It is worth noting that the Polar watch I have road tested often found GPS signal before the Garmin watches when I wear them side by side.Activities/Running/Distance Accuracy/GPS- As a runner this is what is most important to me.- The outdoor running accuracy appears to be incredibly good. IMy Vivoactive 3 has matched (with very small tolerances) with official race measured distances in anything from 5km to 30km races. When I tested this Venu vs the Vivoactive 3 (wearing both on the same two runs) they measured almost exactly the same.- On set up I selected automatic pause so when I stop running, for example at traffic lights, the device automatically pauses and then restarts tracking once I am running again. This feature worked well.- I like the strength training rep counter although I don\u2019t always use it (unless I am wanting to deliberately slow down my work rate)Data screens- Along side the accuracy of data the availability of data whilst running is important to me.- Each data screen can hold 4 pieces of data (e.g. pace, distance, time etc.).- You can customise what data you have via the app.- The data was easy to see whilst running and gave me the information I needed to monitor and improve my performance.Display- The display graphics on the Venu and amazing compared to the Vivoactive 3, I am hugely surprised by the improvement. I have photographed the two watches side by side, the Venu on the top is so much better than the Vivoactive 3. It also looks much more modern in terms of what is displayed on the screen, the layout etc.- I really enjoy the fact that you can customise what data you have on your standard watch screen. I have mine set up to show digital time, date and step count. It did take a bit of time to work out how to do this but worth it once you have it working in the way you want it to.Interaction with other devices and apps- In common with all runners I know I like to be able to analyse my running data and look at details such as my heart rate, pace and so on over the course of a run.- The Venu uses the Garmin Connect app to do this (note you can have more than one Garmin device paired up with the app on your phone). The watch is quick to syncronise and does this itself after activities. It can also be forced via the app.- The have my Garmin App (and therefore the watch data) also syncronised to MyFitnessPal so that my calories burnt are sent over to MFP and calories consumed are sent from MFP to the Garmin (watch and app).As a training aide- Being able to pre-program workouts before setting off makes for much easier interval training.- I use the Garmin to write a training plan with specific work-outs (e.g. interval training) and these then become available in the watch on syncing the two together.- The data you get on the watch at the end of the run is not that extensive (the Polar watch may be better for you if you want this on the watch) but the data in the app is extensive and useful for a post race or run postmortem.Battery life- The battery life on the Venu is very good, but outperformed by the Polar by about 10% when both had the same features engaged (e.g. continuous heart rate monitoring). The increased screen quality is however worth the impact on battery life!- As part of my testing I charged it up and took the Venu out for a 3 hour trail jaunt, using GPS the whole time. I came back with just under 50% battery so happy enough with that and it ties into the 6 hours of GPS usage battery claim.Garmin App- The Garmin Connect App is what takes this watch from a very good 4* product to a 5* watch for me.- It is a real life tracker. I track my weight (and my BMI which is automatically tracks), my steps, my menstrual cycle, my calories in (and out, via a link up with MFP), I analyse my run and race results, set and monitor step (and other activity) goals \u2013 I must look at the App on average 10 times per day.- The App is easy to use, intuitive and I honestly believe it has contributed to me developing an even healthier lifestyle.- The app is the reason why I can\u2019t see myself moving away from Garmin when I need my next running watch/activity tracker.- As an aside I find the 24/7 heart rate monitoring offered by Garmin devices to be incredibly helpful. I normally can work out I am going down will and illness about 12 hours before hand because of my slightly raised resting heart rate etc.Other features- The \u2018sleep\u2019 feature ion the Venu is more accurate than on the Vivoactive 3 which seems to think I\u2019m asleep from the minute I get into bed and start reading until I get up in the morning.- I had the watch paired with my phone all day via the Garmin Connect app so I could receive message etc. notifications \u2013 a useful function but it does drain the battery more quickly.In summary the Garmin Venu is an amazing watch supported by a brilliant app and I would not hesitate to recommend it.Update 9th July 2021: After almost 2 years of daily usage, this watch has suddenly encountered a problem where it no longer charges up. I've tried various cables and chargers which work fine on other Garmin watches. After contacting Garmin customer services, they immediately acknowledged the problem and will take back the watch and send a refurbished replacement. This has now been posted back now. So far, first impressions of customer service is very impressive. I will update once matter is resolved.Update 14th July 2021: The refurbished replacement has arrived today, and as far as I can see, it's a in as good as new condition everything seems to work just fine including charging! setting it up was a breeze, just sync up to your phone app and all the settings are transferred across and all ready to go with minimum fuss. Impressive customer service!",
            "Ich bin wohl einer der ersten, die diese Uhr erhalten hat und m\u00f6chte auf meine Erfahrungen mit ihr eingehen.Seit geraumer Zeit schon suche ich eine Alternative zur Apple Watch f\u00fcr Android User, vorzugsweise mit l\u00e4ngerer Akkulaufzeit.Uhren, die ich bisher besessen oder getestet habe:- Android wear von sony (genutzt)- Amazfit verge (genutzt)- Amazfit BIP S (genutzt)- Amazfit GTR 2 (getestet und zur\u00fcck geschickt)- Garmin Venu (1) (getestet und zur\u00fcck geschickt- Amazfit GTS 2 Mini (genutzt)- Garmin Vivomove Luxe (genutzt, aktuelle Uhr)Und jetzt sollte nach meiner negativen Erfahrung mit der Venu 1, die Venu 2 (als kleine S) noch einen Versuch bekommen.Die Uhr wurde auf Herz und Nieren gepr\u00fcft und hier die Pros, Cons und neutralen Punkte:Pro:- Herzfrequenzmessung ist merklich besser als die vorherige Generation von Garmin (Vivomove Luxe, Venu 1), aber nicht auf dem Level einer Apple watch. Dennoch ist die Venu 2 bisher die einzige Uhr, die HIIT einigerma\u00dfen verfolgen kann und kein Apple Logo besitzt. Deshalb gibt es hier z\u00e4hneknirschend ein Lob.- die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, auch hier gibt es ein vorsichtiges Lob, weil die Uhr immer noch recht dick ist. Trotzdem, die S Version, verglichen mit den meisten anderen Uhren sch\u00f6n klein.- die Garmin Umgebung. Also App, Einstellungen, sync M\u00f6glichkeiten, das ist schon deutlich besser als der Abklatsch von Amazfit. Man merkt auch extrem, dass sich Amazfit hier an Garmin \"orientiert\", aber es eben nicht in gleicher Qualit\u00e4t kopieren kann.- Genauigkeit der restlichen Sensoren, also GPS, Barometer etc. Scheint allesamt besser zu sein als bei der vorherigen Generation. Wobei es jetzt nicht verlgleichbar ist mit dem GPS meines OnePlus 8 Pro, aber Smartphones haben generell ein besseres GPS als Uhren. Es ist auf jeden Fall genau genug und leistet sich wenige Fehler, der Barometer im Gegensatz zur Luxe brauchbar, passt.So die neutralen Punkte:- Display. Ja, Amoled, ja endlich mit dem Glas verklebt und besser als von der Venu 1, aber ganz ehrlich, so nebeneinander ist das Display der 90 Euro \"teuren\" Amazfit GTS 2 nicht schlechter. Wenn ich jetzt entscheiden m\u00fcsste, welches subjektiv gesehen sch\u00f6ner ist, dann tendiere ich sogar zur billigen Amazfit. Bei einem Preis von 400 Euro ist das maximal ein neutral Punkt, weil ein schlechteres Display als das, w\u00e4re negativ.- Bedienung der Uhr. Die ist ok. Wischgesten werden nicht ganz zuverl\u00e4ssig erkannt, daf\u00fcr ist sie einigerma\u00dfen durchdacht. Aber auch hier bewegen wir uns nat\u00fcrlich in einem Preisbereich, in dem die Konkurrenz, nat\u00fcrlich meine ich Apple, ganz andere Ma\u00dfst\u00e4be setzt. Aber man kommt zurecht, also neutral.- Akkulaufzeit. Ja, die ist jetzt auch \"ok\". Mit Blutsauerstoffmessung \u00fcber Nacht und ab und zu GPS muss man sie sp\u00e4testens alle 3 Tage laden. Wie Garmin auf die unrealistischen Werksangaben kommt wissen nur die G\u00f6tter. Laufzeit also sehr verlgleichbar mit meiner Vivomove Luxe und damit noch ok. Dennoch muss man erw\u00e4hnen, dass eine GTS 2 Mini problemlos \u00fcber eine Woche MIT Always on Display kommt, das ist bei Garmin n\u00e4mlich nicht aktiviert, dazu komme ich bei den Cons.Cons:- Geh\u00e4usequalit\u00e4t. Ganz ehrlich, meiner Meinung nach eine Frechheit f\u00fcr das Geld. Die oben erw\u00e4hnte 90 Euro Amazfit Uhr wirkt hochwertiger, mit chinesischen Herstellern im 150\u20ac Bereich braucht die Uhr sich gar nicht versuchen zu messen. Ja etwas Metall um das Glas aber dann ist es doch ein grenzwertig verarbeiteter plastik Klotz. H\u00e4tte ich eine Alternative zur Uhr f\u00fcr Android w\u00e4re das auf jeden Fall ein Ausschlusskriterium. Garmin kann es besser, die (auch \u00fcberteuerte) Vivomove Luxe ist komplett aus Metall, sie wollen nur scheinbar nicht.- Garmins Produktpolitik. Ich mag es einfach nicht, wenn Funktionen, die die Uhr grunds\u00e4tzlich problemlos ausf\u00fchren k\u00f6nnte, der teureren Fenix vorbehalten sind. Reine Software Abgrenzungen um ein teureres Produkt zu rechtfertigen (das dann wiederum andere Dinge nicht kann). Find ich nicht gut, gibt ein con. Konkret geht es um Kartennavigation. K\u00f6nnte die Uhr, kann Garmin, aber sie macht es eben nicht.- Akkulaufzeit bei Always on display. Ja was soll ich sagen, man kann das Display zwar Always on haben, aber die Nutzbarkeit der Uhr ist damit vorbei weil sie schneller leer ist als man bis 3 z\u00e4hlen kann. Andere k\u00f6nnen das VIEL besser.- Displayr\u00e4nder und Wertigkeitseindruck. Diese beiden Punkte gehen Hand in Hand. Was unterscheidet 2021 Smartphones optisch von 2015? Genau, die Displayr\u00e4nder. Viel Rand ohne Funktion wirkt alt und in einer Uhr, auf der das Display ohnehin generell zu klein ist, ist das wichtiger als im Smartphone. Und dann kommt Garmin 2021 mit einer Uhr die Rand \u00fcber Rand hat. Damit meine ich erstmal Rand um den Bildschirm, dann nochmal die Metallumrandung, v\u00f6llig ohne Funktion, dazu. Es wirkt einfach billig, es tut weh zu sehen welche Schmuckst\u00fccke man bei Apple f\u00fcrs gleiche Geld bekommt...- Ladestecker. Ja was soll ich sagen, nichts ist nerviger als eigenartige Ladestecker die nur f\u00fcr die Uhr passen und sonst f\u00fcr nichts. Man muss immer das eine Kabel dabei haben, generell ist das eine Kabel verlegt, es ist nervig. Bei der billiguhr egal, aber eine 400\u20ac Uhr in 2021 muss drahtlos laden k\u00f6nnen. Da gibt's auch keine Diskussion. Kann sie nicht, also con.- Softwarequalit\u00e4t dieser Venu 2. Ich h\u00e4tte gro\u00dfe Probleme. Sie h\u00e4ngt sich auf, Update funktioniert nicht, Apps laden funktioniert nicht, was ich mich alleine am ersten Tag herum ge\u00e4rgert habe. Unglaublich. Ich hatte hier schon ein 1 Stern review stehen, dass ich mittlerweile korrigiert habe. Ja, ich bin einer der ersten der die Uhr gekauft hat aber das war schon unter aller Kanone.Ja was ist also das Fazit?Ich befinde mich in der dummen Situation, dass ich die Uhr wahrscheinlich behalten werde, schlichtweg weil es derzeit keine Alternativen gibt f\u00fcr Android.- Samsung hat noch schlechteren Akku und der herzfrenzsensor ist mies- Polar hat noch mehr plastik und schlechtere Messung- amazfit baut sch\u00f6ne schicke Uhren aber die Qualit\u00e4t der Sportmessungen ist unter aller Kanone bei den top Modellen, software grenzwertig- Huawei ist so ein Mittelding aus Samsung und amazfit, auch da gibt's keine Uhr die man wirklich als Alternative zur Apple watch ansehen kann- s\u00e4mtliche Android wear Uhren disqualifizieren sich durch die Akkulaufzeit und die, die es nicht tun durch Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und messungenauigkeiten.Ich f\u00fchle mich als Android Nutzer als wie der amerikanische W\u00e4hler an der Wahlurne 2016, ich habe mich f\u00fcr die Venu 2 entschieden, aber eigentlich w\u00fcnsche ich mir etwas anderes.",
            "I bought this watch as a replacement for a Vivoactive 3. I wanted a newer watch with a nicer display, and better heartrate tracking accuracy. The Vivoactive 3 was never quite amazing at tracking my heartrate through the HIIT nature of powerlifting, and I could be out of breath to the point of needing to bend over to catch my breath after a heavy set of squats and my heartrate would register 99, with the Vivoactive 3 finally registering properly when my heartrate dropped to around 130 bpm.After doing some research on other brands in case I wanted to switch (investigated Fitbit, Amazfit and others), I decided to stick with Garmin for the better battery life, GPS accuracy, body battery feature, and the fact that you can put your own music on the Venu 2/2s whereas Fitbit has removed that feature in favour of streaming only. I use YouTube music, so only supporting Spotify/Deezer on the Fitbits was no deal for me. Amazfit's heart tracking is around as accurate as my Vivoactive 3 if not worse from the reviews I watched analyzing it, so that was also a no-go.In short, the display is lovely, the built-in watch face in the photo fits my preferences perfectly so going to the Connect store for one was not necessary, and the heart rate tracking keeps up with my lifts. Instead of the watch thinking I haven't hit my intensity minutes goals, it realises I do 200-300 per week with my training.The negative reviews here are mostly strikes against the cost of this device for the tracking and accuracy of the metrics vs other cheaper Garmin devices. Remember here that you are paying premium for a nice-looking AMOLED display. If the display type doesn't bother you much, then I would recommend waiting on the Vivoactive 5. If your main activity type is running, then a Forerunner is likely a better option. However, if you're like myself and your main sport is powerlifting or another, and/or you want a beautiful, sharp display on your watch coupled with great battery life, then this is for you.",
            "Received the watch earlier than expected - great work, Amazon. The watch looks good, and the display - when it\u2019s on - is pretty. However, that may be the extent of the upside. The problem is the \u2018always on\u2019 feature, which is what persuaded me to buy the Venu rather than the Vivoactive 4 (which is identical in function). I have had several Garmin watches, and I also have an Apple Watch 3. Despite its lovely display, the fact that it goes blank and you need to move your wrist to see it made it intolerable for me. The Vivoactive 3 I replaced it with has a less pretty display, but you can always see it - and its sports features are way ahead of anything you can get on the Apple Watch. So the Venu, with an \u2018always on\u2019 OLED display, should have combined the best of both, with some functional enhancements too. But the display is very uncooperative. It decides when it\u2019s going to be on, and that often isn\u2019t what you asked it to do! It may show the power-saving \u2018always on\u2019 face (basically just the time) for some of the time, but refuse to wake up and show the full display when you move it. Or it will just be blank. And resolutely stay blank until you hit it. Hard. No amount of playing with the screen settings has resolved this behaviour. I hope a firmware update will improve it (mine is on 3.4), but as yet I can\u2019t recommend it.",
            "Als die Venu angek\u00fcndigt wurde wusste ich dass ich nicht wiederstehen konnte und von meiner Forerunner 645 Music umsteigen werde. Dank Vorbestellung von Amazon hatte ich sie schon vor Release und konnte sie schon gut testen.+Design: die Uhr wirkt sehr hochwertig, dezent und edel und kann sogar mit Silikonband zu schicken Outfits getragen werden. Die Verarbeitung l\u00e4sst wirklich nicht zu w\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig und sie l\u00e4sst sich bequem den ganzen Tag tragen+Display: f\u00fcr mich die perfekte Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und hier der erste deutliche Unterschied zur Forerunner: sehr sch\u00f6ne Farben, gestochen scharf und auch im Training immer gut ablesbar.Ich hatte etwas Bedenken wegen dem Touchscreen aber wurde \u00fcberzeugt. Es l\u00e4sst sich pr\u00e4zise navigieren, reagiert promt. Da Garmin ja ein sehr umfangreiches Men\u00fc hat, f\u00e4llt es mir mit dem Touchscreen sogar deutlich leichter.+Training: f\u00fcr mich das wichtigste denn ich suchte keine SmartWatch mit Fitnessfunktion sondern eine LAUFuhr! Denn ich laufe 5mal Pro Woche im ambitionierten Marathontraining. Hier bietet bie Venu gleiches Potential wie die Forerunner mit einigen Verbesserungen.1. Das GPS findet deutlich schneller Signal2. Der Herzfrequenz Sensor ist sehr genau und reagiert schnell auf \u00c4nderung was f\u00fcr mich im Intervall Training sehr wichtig istDie Forerunner konnte ich hier nur mit Brustgurt verwenden, bei der Venu ist die Messung am Handgelenk so exakt dass ich den Gurt immer weniger benutze.+Akku: die Uhr kam mit gut 90% Akku an, ich habe sie nicht geladen und jetzt 4 Tage benutzt. Dabei war ich drei Mal trainieren und habe nat\u00fcrlich am Anfang viel an der Uhr gespielt. Aktuell haben ich noch 26% , die Akkuleistung scheint also sogar besser als von Garmin angegeben. Ganz klar ein Plus!Ich kann bisher nichts kritisieren. Der pulsoximeter ist nett, f\u00fcr mich aber eher eine kleine Spielerei. Die Funktion mit der Body Battery ist aber toll! Ich bin sehr zufrieden",
            "I do a lot of running and wanted to be able to ditch my phone but still track my runs and listen to music. I did a lot of research before buying this watch and decided this was the best option. I got it for under \u00a3200.MUSIC: The built in Spotify app is a feature which the Apple Watch doesn't have. This is really useful and simple to sync music / podcasts (albeit note that Garmin / Spotify have a problem with syncing podcasts from BBC Sounds - I have taken this up with both of them and got a very disappointing response that they are not supported).ACTIVITIES: The Venu Sq tracks all activities. I use it to run and in the gym. It tracks my runs accurately and (once setup) links automatically to my strava. It tracks sets / reps relatively well in the gym automatically. You can amend the exercise / reps / weight in the Garmin Connect app after (although this does keep crashing when I amend the above which is annoying).PERFORMANCE: The touch screen is ok. I have always found Garmin a bit difficult to navigate. My father has a Forerunner and I struggle to use the buttons on that. But it's certainly no worse than any other Garmin.BUILD: I have scratched the side of the watch which is annoying. I have since bought a screen protector and that has helped avoid any scratches to the screen. But overall the build seems good. Put it to use; it doesn't matter if it gets a little scratched.OVERALL: Overall I'm really happy with the watch. It's great for what I wanted, i.e. to ditch my phone. I still think it's great to go out running with just my headphones and a key. The Apple Watch doesn't give you the links to Spotify. There are limited number of Garmin watches that do. This is the cheapest; but I think it does just as good a job at tracking activities as a Forerunner (not tried a Fenix).",
            "I bought this to replace my broken Fitbit charge 3. The data captured is much more useful for me to understand my body situation than my Fitbit. Charging it every day I take a shower, and it comes to 100% battery after that. Synchronization is fast and smooth (while my old charge 3 took a lot of time and sometimes not syncing for the whole day), the screen is clear to see, and the interface can be customised to very personal, friendly one.",
            "I love a good watch.I think it's fair to say I've owned a large number of watches during my life, both standard and smart. Most smartwatches come with an array of functions, most of which are useless to me. I started getting smartwatches because I kept missing calls/texts and wanted something to help with that. The vibration motor on this watch is perfect for this; it's certainly not something you'll miss when you get called etc.Last year my wife suggested that I may be suffering from sleep apnea, so I decided to see what watches were around that could help prove that. It turns out that although there are a lot of watches out there with SPO2 functionality, the majority of them don't run a continuous trace, and instead just have an on-demand check. For someone looking to monitor sleep, this is useless. So I was down to just a few watches, and the price point meant that realistically it was down to this watch and the Fitbit Versa 3.I spent weeks researching the two watches, and was almost decided on the Versa; with a slightly larger screen and AMOLED at that, it seemed a no-brainer. Until I saw some posts on the Fitbit forums where everyone was complaining that to analyse SPO2 results required a monthly fee. All the posts contained people's wish they'd gone for this watch instead. My mind was made up.So here we are.There is a lot of functionality in this watch, most of which I've not used. It seems accurate enough in my step count and can tell me how far I've walked on the off-chance I've walked anywhere.The sleep monitoring is on a par with other watches but can give me not only the information about what type of sleep I've had at various points during the night, but also how many breaths per minute I'm managing, and of course the all-important SPO2 graph.The stress monitoring I'm not totally sure about; it shows I get very little stress during the night, but it can get quite high during the working day. I do have a stressful job, but it's not something I've really thought as affecting me in any negative way. Something to keep an eye on I guess.The app (android) gives you all the information you need about all functions offered and is very easy to understand (with information pages where needed).The screen is easy to read inside and outside - I've yet to try it outside on a sunny day, but we don't get many of those and aren't allowed outside anyway. It's small though, which is a small issue for me as I wear glasses for up-close work like reading and using computers, but don't wear them otherwise; making the watch hard to see. You can change the watch face, however, and with a large selection to choose from (and the option to make your own), there's certainly something for every eye strength.It'll be hard for me to pass judgement on the battery life; for my use, it lasts 6-8 days which is great, but I do very little exercise at the moment and appreciate that the battery life will be far less if I'm running all over the shop every day.Overall, I'm really happy with this watch; the only thing I'd change would be to have a larger screen.I might keep this one the longest.",
            "Ich habe von einer Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music auf die Venu gewechselt.F\u00fcr mich war das Mip Display der Vivoactive 3 Music optisch ein Graus, hat aber seine Arbeit bei allen Lichtverh\u00e4ltnissen anstandslos getan.Da ich meine Uhr 24h trage und auch gerne zu feierlichen Anl\u00e4ssen, kommt mir die Venu mit dem Amoled Display gerade recht.Das Men\u00fc der Venu ist etwas anders aufgebaut als bei der Vivoactive, aber daf\u00fcr auch mit zwei Kn\u00f6pfen zu bedienen.Ich denke ein Knopf h\u00e4tte es hier auch getan.Habe die Uhr erst seit sechs Tagen in Gebrauch, musste sie aber auch erst zweimal laden.Dazu z\u00e4hlen 16h always on Display, st\u00e4ndiger Pulsmesser, gelegentliche Benachrichtigungen, 2,5h Indooraktivit\u00e4t ohne GPS sowie eine Outdooraktivit\u00e4t mit GPS.Das Armband der Vivoactive konnte ich wieder verwenden (20mm Stegbreite) und auch so macht die Uhr einen optisch sch\u00f6nen Eindruck.Sie liegt gut am Handgelenk und ist f\u00fcr ihr Format sehr leicht.Das Ladekabel ist mit der Vivoactive identisch.Im IQ Store findet man zur Zeit leider noch nicht so viele Watchfaces.Aber ich denke das legt sich bald.Als Umsteiger bin ich letztendlich vollkommen zufrieden, auch wenn ich bei der Ablesbarkeit in der prallen Sonne im Gegensatz zur Vivoactive Abstriche machen muss.",

Par contre elles sont \u00e9quip\u00e9es d'un vibreur tr\u00e8s efficace pour vous alerter.La finition est correcte mais les boutons en plastique et le bracelet font un peu \"cheap\". Mais, \u00e0 moins de 200\u20ac, le tarif reste imbattable par rapport aux fonctionnalit\u00e9s propos\u00e9es.La Venu 2S est une version plus \u00e9volu\u00e9e qui inclut un \u00e9cran rond AMOLED 1,2 pouce haute r\u00e9solution, un cerclage en acier inoxydable, et des animations des exercices sur l'\u00e9cran. Ce mod\u00e8le est non seulement plus qualitatif mais il est aussi plus r\u00e9actif, donc je suppose que le processeur embarqu\u00e9 dans la 2S est plus puissant.Esth\u00e9tiquement je trouve le mod\u00e8le 2S beaucoup plus r\u00e9ussi et, malgr\u00e9 une taille identique de 40mm, il apparait plus discret et plus \u00e9l\u00e9gant sur un petit poignet.Capteurs de sant\u00e9 communes aux 2 montres :Une Venu/Venu2 se porte toute la journ\u00e9e et toute la nuit, de sorte que la montre affiche les scores de vos constantes physiques. Ceci ne pose aucun probl\u00e8me vu la l\u00e9g\u00e8ret\u00e9 et l'autonomie des 2 appareils qui d\u00e9passe 5 jours sans probl\u00e8me. De plus ces deux mod\u00e8les sont \u00e9galement \u00e9tanches.Fr\u00e9quence cardiaque : mesur\u00e9e au poignet elle est tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cise sur les 2 montres. Elle peut s'afficher \u00e0 la demande ou m\u00eame appara\u00eetre en permanence sur l'\u00e9cran d'accueil (le \"cadran de montre\"). C'est le m\u00eame capteur pour les 2 appareils.Oxym\u00e8tre de pouls : mesure le taux d'oxyg\u00e8ne sanguin. Cette mesure est sensible au mouvement ou \u00e0 la position de la montre sur le poignet. Contrairement \u00e0 d'autres montres, on peut ici demander le calcul de la SpO2 \u00e0 tout moment (\u00e7a prend une dizaine de secondes) sachant que l'appareil peut l'enregistrer \u00e0 intervalle r\u00e9gulier pendant que vous dormez, ce qui peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s utile si vous soup\u00e7onnez une apn\u00e9e du sommeil.La Venu 2S b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d'un capteur plus r\u00e9cent que la SQ et j'ai effectivement constat\u00e9 des mesures plus pr\u00e9cises pour la 2S par rapport \u00e0 un capteur \u00e0 l'index que je poss\u00e8de par ailleurs et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement \u00e9talonn\u00e9.Respiration : il s\u2019agit du nombre de respiration par minute. La donn\u00e9e est mesur\u00e9e en temps r\u00e9el en permanence et participe au score de votre sommeil.Fonction de synth\u00e8se :L\u2019aper\u00e7u sant\u00e9 donne un aper\u00e7u de votre \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9. Le score est bas\u00e9 sur plusieurs param\u00e8tres : fr\u00e9quence Cardiaque (FC), variabilit\u00e9 de la FC, taux d'oxyg\u00e8ne sanguin, respiration et stress.Le moniteur d'\u00e9nergie donne votre \u00ab r\u00e9serve \u00bb d'\u00e9nergie tout au long de la journ\u00e9e (\u00e9chelle de 1 \u00e0 100). Un nombre plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 signifie que vous \u00eates pr\u00eat pour une activit\u00e9 ; un nombre plus faible signifie que votre r\u00e9serve d'\u00e9nergie est d\u00e9charg\u00e9e et que vous avez besoin d'une pause.Suivi du stress : c'est un indicateur composite calcul\u00e9 \u00e0 partir des efforts r\u00e9alis\u00e9s et des temps de repos. Tout est pris en compte y compris le nombre de pas ou le nombre d'\u00e9tages parcourus.Suivi de l'hydratation et des calories : ces deux indicateurs demandent votre participation puisque la montre ne peut pas savoir ce que vous absorbez en liquide ou en calories. Par contre elle connait vos d\u00e9penses \u00e0 partir des efforts r\u00e9alis\u00e9s et de vos param\u00e8tres physiques (\u00e2ge, taille, poids). Ceci permet au final de savoir si vous \u00eates en exc\u00e9dent ou en d\u00e9ficit de calories ou d'hydratation.Suivi du cycle menstruel : non test\u00e9Suivi de la respiration : mesur\u00e9e en permanence et en temps r\u00e9el. Je n'ai aucune id\u00e9e sur la m\u00e9thode employ\u00e9e par ces appareils pour mesurer la respiration, mais les chiffres annonc\u00e9s me semblent r\u00e9alistes et viennent compl\u00e9ter les statistiques de suivi.Suivi du sommeil : les 2 montres sont capables de d\u00e9tecter quand vous vous couchez et quand vous dormez. Vous d\u00e9finissez un objectif pour l'heure de coucher et l'heure de r\u00e9veil, et un score est calcul\u00e9 sur la base de la dur\u00e9e et de la qualit\u00e9 de votre sommeil, sachant que les 3 phases (l\u00e9ger, profond et paradoxal) sont d\u00e9tect\u00e9es et suivies. L'historique de votre taux d'oxyg\u00e8ne pendant le sommeil est \u00e9galement g\u00e9r\u00e9.Fonctions g\u00e9n\u00e9ralesActivit\u00e9 : Les montres Venu sont des montres de Fitness orient\u00e9es vers le sport et la sant\u00e9. De nombreuses activit\u00e9s sont g\u00e9r\u00e9es pour tous les types de sports, y compris la natation ou le ski. Une activit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9e manuellement mais aussi automatiquement car la montre d\u00e9tecte vos mouvements et vos d\u00e9placements. Ainsi, si vous d\u00e9marrez une balade, la montre le d\u00e9tecte et d\u00e9clenchera le suivi de l\u2019activit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s un temps que vous d\u00e9finissez mais \u00e0 partir du moment exact de votre d\u00e9part. Elle d\u00e9tectera aussi toute interruption pendant votre marche et la d\u00e9comptera de votre activit\u00e9. Pour les activit\u00e9s en salle, la montre peut se connecter \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents capteurs ext\u00e9rieurs pour am\u00e9liorer le suivi.Notifications du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone : vous pouvez d\u00e9cider via l'application Garmin quelles notifications seront transmises \u00e0 votre montre. La communication s'effectue en Bluetooth et non en Wi-Fi ce qui signifie que la montre doit rester \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone.Suivi et r\u00e9ponses aux messages (SMS, WhatsApp...) : comme pour les notifications, votre montre et votre smartphone peuvent partager les messages et les r\u00e9ponses pour la plupart des applications de messagerie. La montre ne disposant pas d'un clavier, on enregistre des r\u00e9ponses courtes (Oui, Non, Je te rappelle plus tard, etc.) que l'on s\u00e9lectionne avec une liste d\u00e9roulante et que l'on peut envoyer au correspondant sans passer par le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone.Livetrack : cette fonction permet d'informer des proches sur sa position pendant une activit\u00e9. La fonction peut se d\u00e9clencher manuellement ou automatiquement lorsque la montre d\u00e9tecte le d\u00e9marrage d'une activit\u00e9 (course, marche, v\u00e9lo, rando...).Alerte temps r\u00e9el vers un proche : il est possible de d\u00e9finir jusqu\u2019\u00e0 trois contacts pouvant \u00eatre alert\u00e9s (par SMS et email) en cas d'urgence en appuyant pendant 5 secondes sur le bouton sup\u00e9rieur de la montre.Musique : La Garmin SQ simple ne poss\u00e8de pas de lecteur int\u00e9gr\u00e9 et peut juste piloter le lecteur de musique de votre smartphone via Bluetooth.En optant pour les mod\u00e8les SQ ou 2S avec fonction musique, vous disposez de 8Go de m\u00e9moire pour stocker vos MP3 dans la montre, soit par transfert de fichiers via USB (mp3 \u00e0 copier dans le dossier MUSIC de la montre) soit en utilisant l'application Garmin. Il est sans doute possible de transf\u00e9rer des fichiers depuis le smartphone vers la montre en utilisant un c\u00e2ble OTG mais je ne peux le garantir.Les Venu 2S/SQ avec fonction musiques sont \u00e9galement capables d'acc\u00e9der \u00e0 Internet via Wi-Fi et donc d'utiliser les services de streaming, comme Deezer, Spotify ou Amazon Music. Il manque \u00e0 l'appel YouTube Music.Garmin Pay est disponible sur les 2 mod\u00e8les et fonctionne parfaitement, si votre banque supporte le service. Un paiement s'effectuera directement sans contact avec la montre \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sur le terminal de paiement, apr\u00e8s introduction de votre code secret configurable au moment de l'association du service avec votre carte de paiement.L\u2019application Garmin doit obligatoirement \u00eatre install\u00e9e sur votre smartphone pour faire l\u2019appairage et l\u2019initialisation. Elle permet de faire le lien entre la montre et votre smartphone, soit pour le param\u00e9trer, soit pour afficher des statistiques. L'application est tr\u00e8s bien con\u00e7ue et je n'ai eu absolument aucun probl\u00e8me pour l'utiliser, y compris en synchro avec les 2 appareils en m\u00eame temps.Cloud :Le site connect.garmin.com permet de g\u00e9rer tous les appareils Garmin enregistr\u00e9s et d'acc\u00e9der aux tableaux de bord d\u00e9taill\u00e9s de votre activit\u00e9.La boutique ConnectIQ vous permet de t\u00e9l\u00e9charger des centaines d'activit\u00e9s, widgets ou cadrans de montres, sachant que pour ces derniers, la plupart sont modifiables directement depuis la montre.L'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me n'est \u00e9videmment pas aussi \u00e9tendu que Wear OS mais on trouve ce qu'on veut, y compris des boussoles, des logiciels de navigation, etc. Et la plupart de ces applications sont gratuites.Conclusion :Un crit\u00e8re important pour une montre connect\u00e9e est l'autonomie, et de ce point de vue, les deux mod\u00e8les sont tr\u00e8s bons, avec entre 10 et 15% de batterie consomm\u00e9e par jour avec une activit\u00e9 d'une heure utilisant le GPS. Vous pouvez vous contenter de recharger ces montres une fois par semaine.Autre crit\u00e8re important, la pr\u00e9cision du GPS. Et l\u00e0 encore c'est tr\u00e8s bon avec quasiment aucune d\u00e9viation avec un GPS de smartphone.Au final, \u00e0 moins de 200\u20ac la Venu SQ est une super affaire pour celui qui veut s'initier \u00e0 l'usage d'une montre de fitness connect\u00e9e. Avec la 2S on est clairement sur un mod\u00e8le beaucoup plus \u00e9l\u00e9gant et qualitatif, qui conviendra mieux aux petits poignets. Pour ma part j\u2019opte pour la 2S couleur gris clair et cerclage acier que vous voyez sur les photos.",
            "Ok hardware, but software makes very poor use of the new high-resolution AMOLED display.The Venu seems rushed to market to me. It has a nice, bright high resolution display. However, other than a handful of pretty (but mostly featureless) watch faces, the Garmin software makes absolutely no use of the display. Most of the UI and many of the watch faces look pixelated and rough. Whilst Garmin get away with this on the MIP display used on their other always-on smartwatches - the higher resolution display of the Venu just exposes how bad the UI is. If you are expecting the Venu to be a polished version of the Vivoactive you will be very disappointed. This is no Apple/Samsung watch competitor.Added to this, in my copy of the watch, the touch screen display was often unresponsive. It was so bad at recognising left/right swipes that I found it almost impossible to change watch faces.As-is I can't recommend the Venu - the software just isn't fit for purpose. Which is a shame.",
            "(Unten sind 2 Update)Aktuell trage ich, zum Vergleichen, mal eine 120\u20ac Huawei Watch GT active und die neue Garmin Venu.Ich habe mich wie Sau auf die Garmin gefreut, bin aber auf dem Boden der Tatsachen angelangt. Aber von vorne.Vor Jahren trug ich eine Forerunner 235 und war sehr zufrieden. Dann machte ich den Fehler eine Vivoactive 3 zu kaufen. Nachdem ich diese zur\u00fcckgegeben habe bin ich \u00fcber Samsung und Amazfit bei der Huawei Watch GT gelandet (auch bei Amaz. gekauft). Nach der Ank\u00fcndigung der Venu konnte ich es kaum erwarten endlich wieder ein gutes Device zu haben. Zudem, und das sollte man nicht unerw\u00e4hnt lassen, ist das Garmin Webfrontend wirklich gut.350\u20ac will Garmin f\u00fcr diese \u00fcberaus leichte Uhr. Die Leichtigkeit hat mich positiv \u00fcberrascht.Bis heute kann die Garmin-App unter Android scheinbar keine Widgets. Ansonsten ist sie sehr aufschlussreich und detailliert. Als Beispiel im Anhang ein Screenshot des Dashboards. Um kurz vor 10 der letzte Sync um 05:50, autoamtisch wird bei mir nichts gesynct. So machen dann nat\u00fcrlich Widgets auch keinen Sinn.Ich hab dann gleich mal nen Track ausprobiert. Einen Ausschnitt sieht man im angeh\u00e4ngten Bild. Die Huawei trackt diesen Gang genau so bl\u00f6d. Also quer \u00fcber die Stra\u00dfe und dergleichen. Ich bin nat\u00fcrlich straight gegangen. Herzfrequenz und Co stimmen halbwegs \u00fcberein. Zumindest gibt es kein Device welches sich jetzt irgendwie besonders auff\u00e4llig anders verh\u00e4lt. Wo hier 350\u20ac zu verantworten sind? Mir ist das nicht ganz klar.SchlaftrackerHier sind die Daten durchaus unterschiedlich. Aber das liegt an den unterschiedlichen Logiken mit denen die Firmen auswerten. Fair Deal und nachvollziehbarABER: Garmin schafft es auch mit dem neuen Device nicht Nickerchen zu erfassen. Die Huawei macht das mit traumt\u00e4nzerischer Sicherheit. Zudem MUSS ich, wenn ich das alles richtig sehe, noch immer \"Nicht st\u00f6ren\" Zeiten einrichten an die sich die Garmin h\u00e4lt. Bei der Huawei wird dies aufgrund der guten Schlaferkennung \u00fcberfl\u00fcssig.Der Blutsauerstoffsensor h\u00e4lt sich exakt an die eingestellte Zeit die man angeben muss um zu definieren wann man ungef\u00e4hr schl\u00e4ft (wenn man den Sensor nicht ganzt\u00e4gig aktiv l\u00e4sst, ist aber \u00fcberfl\u00fcssig). Das wiederum bedeutet das ich in der Woche um 5 aufstehe - am Wochenende aber bis 9 schlafe. Somit trackt der Oximeter Sensor NUR von 21:30 bis 5 Uhr.Klar, ich k\u00f6nnte das erweitern. Ich frage mich aber wo Garmin die Entwicklung verpasst hat wenn Huawei das mit seiner 120\u20ac Watch GT Active (nicht Watch GT 2) problemlos kann.Das Display.Ist absolut einwadfrei. Als negativ Beispiel sei hier die Amazfit Verge genannt. Die hat selbst im hellsten Modus kaum die Sonne ausgehalten.Allerdings ist das Display der Venu durch den Klarlackplastikring (wie bei der Vivoative 3 Music) k\u00fcnstlich klein gehalten. Es geht aber noch und ist soweit OK. Gef\u00fchlt ist kaum eines der Watchfaces die man im Hauseigenen Store (kostenlos) anbietet wirklich angepasst.Das Design:Ist schon OK. Wenn ich die Watch GT sehe wirklich diese einfach etwas maskuliner, erwachsener und \"st\u00e4rker\".Was mir so gar nicht gef\u00e4llt ist der Umgang seitens Garmin mit den Kunden. Man betreibt ein eigenes Forum, liest aber (nach Supportaussagen) dort gar nicht mit. K\u00fcmmert sich gar nicht drum. Die Venu scheint ein ziemlich problematischer Launch zu sein. Firmware 3.50 ist derzeit 3 Wochen alt und im Venu/Vivoactive 4 Forum h\u00e4ufen sich Probleme. Die VA4 und die Venu sind, bis auf das Display, identisch.Bitte nicht falsch verstehen. Die Huawei hat gen\u00fcgend Schw\u00e4chen. Aber die kostet auch kein kleines Verm\u00f6gen.Aktuell sehe ich keinerlei Grund bei der Venu zu bleiben. Das gro\u00dfartige Webfrontend w\u00e4re tats\u00e4chlich der einzige Grund dazu. Ich werde noch eine FW abwarten und sehen welche \u00c4nderungen Garmin denn nach X Wochen doch dem Kunden noch an die Hand gibt. Ansonsten geht die Venu weinenden Auges zur\u00fcck. Applepreise mit dieser Qualit\u00e4t bin ich nicht bereit zu zahlen. Alleine das der GPS Sensor so ungenau wie der von Huawei ist entt\u00e4uscht mich massiv.Ich frage mich da schon ob veraltetet strukturen und \"festhalten an bekannten Dingen\" dazu f\u00fchrt das es scheinbar im Softwarebereich so wenig Fortschritte gibt. Schlaftracker? Naps? Widgets? Auto-Sync der Daten von der Uhr zum Handy? Alles Teufelszeug oder so gew\u00fcnscht? wenn \"Gew\u00fcnscht\", vom wem? Zu alten Entwicklern oder Firmenentscheidern?------------------------------------------------------------------------>>--->> Update vom 15.11.2019Die Venu geht zur\u00fcck. Sehr sehr schweren Herzens muss ich mir eingestehen das es so keinen Sinn macht. Ich werde Garmin und die Uhr vermissen.Stresslevel/Body Battery.:Garmin ist scheinbar nicht in der Lage Nickerchen zu erkennen. Das macht die \"Body Battery\" zum Witz. Ich w\u00fcrde erwarten das sich meine Batterie auf\u00fcllt wenn ich mich mal ausruhe. Nix da. Geht weiter runter. Parallel f\u00fcllt sie sich auf wenn ich im Stau stehe und mich \u00e4rgere.Schlaftracker:Kaputt wie eh und je. Ich hab, nach der VA3 2018, ein paar Dinge ausprobiert. Samsung, Amazfit, Huawei usw und sogar diese seltsame Nokia Matratze. Sobald ich ein Garmindevice um tue sind meine Shclafwerte komplett im Eimer. Tiefschlaf? Mit viel Gl\u00fcck mal 30 Minuten, eher weniger. Der starre SPOx Sensor, der (scheinbar) nicht OnDemand gestartet werden kann misst in der Regel ~5% weniger als ein 20\u20ac Fingersensor.GPS Tracker:Im letzten Bild (ich wei\u00df das die Auf Amazon zu klein und unscharf sind) ist als Beispiel ein Walk zu sehen. Einmal die Strasse hoch und wieder runter. Nat\u00fcrlich MIT Jacke, wir haben Herbst.Genau das macht meine 120\u20ac Watch GT ebenso mies, oder gut.....der kann ich das verzeihen. Einer 370\u20ac Garmin Venu eher nichtF\u00fcr mich ist hier Ende. Ich sehe mich nicht in der Lage das weiter zu unterst\u00fctzen. Die 3.60 FW, die gestern kam, verbessert dahingehen auch nichts. Wenn Garmin den Betastest an den K\u00e4ufern zu Applepreise durchziehen will? Bittesch\u00f6n. Sollte die Venu mal unter 250\u20ac fallen bin ich wieder dabei. Ich muss halt leider selber kaufen.------------------Update 18.11.2019Sucht man sich in einem Videoportal das Vergleichsvideo von Pocketnavigation zur Fenix 6 so sieht man sehr schnell wie ungenau der GPS Chip ist. Das ist quasi das gleich wie bei dem einfachen Track von mir festgestellt. Da ist so viel daneben.",
            "I've previously owned the Vivoactive 3. When the Vivoactive 4 came along I had no doubt whatsoever that I was going to get it.Then I discovered the Venu which was marketed as a Vivoactive 4 with a better screen.The one (tiny) gripe I always had with my V3 was that the screen colours were not very good and quite flat (even though it's very good in bright light).The Venu changed all that. Very deep colours on a 390 x 390 AMOLED display (vs the 240 x 240 on the V3).The watch has a great number of features and options, but most of them will be familiar to Garmin users. The Body Battery is a neat feature, as is the Pulse Ox, even though I haven't had the chance to test this thoroughly yet.I find the device quite responsive and the battery life (so far) seems very decent.The Venu is very light but looks and feels like a premium product.One difference with the V3 (in the V3's favour) is that the Venu is doesn't have an 'always on' feature, i.e. you have to double tap the screen or press the top button to view. Not an issue though and I can see why they've done that as it would be a huge drain on the battery.All in all I'm very happy with my purchase. There have already been several software updates and I'm sure there will be more going forward to dial in this new product.If functionality comes first and display quality is less of a consideration, go for the Vivoactive 4. If you want the functionality and also enjoy a great display, go for the Venu.",
            "Okay, da ist sie. Man was war ich scharf auf das Teil. Aber leider ist nun, weitgehend, Ern\u00fcchterung eingekehrt.Zun\u00e4chst zu mir: meine erste SmartWatch war eine Garmin, danach kamen diverse andere Modelle,ua. von Fitbit, Mobvoi Ticwatch und Huawei.Schon damals war die Garmin irgendwie umst\u00e4ndlich, bzw. unlogisch zu bedienen. Irgendwie finde ich keine klare Linie auf dem Weg durch die Men\u00fcs. Das hat sich leider in meinem Augen noch verschlimmbessert.Die dazugeh\u00f6rige App(s) sind etwas besser, aber meiner Meinung nach immer noch schlechter als die anderen Hersteller.Es dauert sowohl auf der Uhr, als auch in den Apps etwas l\u00e4nger, sich zurecht zu finden.Zur Hardware: ich wusste, dass ich hier kein Schmuckst\u00fcck bekomme, daf\u00fcr steht Garmin einfach nicht. Ist halt ein Plastikbomber, aber der ist gut verarbeitet, kann man tragen.Die Datenerfassung scheint recht gut zu sein, aber das muss ich noch ein paar Tage beobachten, bis ich mir hier eine endg\u00fcltige Meinung bilden kann.Ich werde diese Rezension weiter aktuell halten und berichten, ob das Dingen hier bleibt, oder zur\u00fcck gehen muss.Wie gesagt, aufgrund der unn\u00f6tig umst\u00e4ndlichen Software bin ich immo noch sehr entt\u00e4uscht.Update 2.9.:Ich mag sie .., irgendwie. Bildschirm ist toll, sie ist gut zu tragen!Aber das Teil nervt.Zum Beispiel Schlaferfassung: geht quasi nur zu den vorher eingestellten Zeiten, von selbst merkt dass Teil nichts. Morgens muss man der Uhr sogar sagen, das man wach ist. Kann zB. Huawei deutlich besser.Beispiel Training: Habe mir \u00fcber die App zwei Krafttrainings ausgesucht und auf die Uhr \u00fcbertragen lassen. Glaubt mal nicht, dass die dort irgendwo zu finden sind.\u00dcberhaupt: die Bedienung ist derma\u00dfen unlogisch, warum macht man das nicht so aufger\u00e4umt und logisch wie die Mitbewerber?Okay, ich \u00fcberlege noch 2 Tage, tendiere aber stark dazu, sie zur\u00fcck zu geben! Schade Garmin...Update 12.10.Tja, da ich immer noch hin und her gerissen war, habe ich Depp den R\u00fcckgabezeitpunkt verpasst. Selbst schuld.Eigentlich hat sich f\u00fcr mich nichts ver\u00e4ndert, ist ne Art Hassliebe geblieben. Garmin hat leider noch keine, f\u00fcr mich entscheidende, Updates gebracht. Werden sie wohl auch nicht mehr, ist scheinbar Firmenpolitik, die Benutzer mit Software, sowohl in der App als auch auf der Uhr, ohne Sinn und Verstand zu \u00e4rgern.Warum z.B. ist der untere Bedienbutton nicht mit einer Funktion belegbar? Oder bin ich zu bl\u00f6d, das zu finden...???Au\u00dfer der Schlaf\u00fcberwachung (wieso lebe ich eigentlich noch?) \u00fcberzeugen mich jedenfalls die Messwerte. Der GPS-Fix dauert in der Regel leider sehr lang. Die angegebene Akkulaufzeit stimmt ungef\u00e4hr.Garmin, da w\u00e4re so viel mehr drin gewesen!",
            "Pros:- Sieht ganz gut aus- Heart-Rate tracking sehr akkurat- Gutes GPS trackingCons *Tief Luft hohl*:- Physische Kn\u00f6pfeDiese sind rechts was beim tragen von Wrist Wraps/Straps beim Bodybuilding/Krafttraining zu versehentlichen ausl\u00f6sen f\u00fchrt. Das ist super nervig- Sleep TrackingEinschlaf, Aufsteht und Wachzeiten sind zwar ziemlich gut, das war es aber auch schon.Vorallem die Tief, Leicht und REM Schlafphasen sind jenseits von gut und B\u00f6\u00dfe. Pro nacht habe ich nur eine Tiefschlafphase welche nahezu direkt nach dem einschlafen liegt und zwischen 10 und 30 minuten liegt, das wars.Bei review videos auf youtube habe ich nahezu identische aufnahmen gesehen.Das wirkt fast so als w\u00fcrde Garmin zuf\u00e4llige werte w\u00e4hlen und diese nach einem gewissen schema anzeigenHierbei handelt es sich jedoch nur um Vermutungen. Ob die Daten vll. doch korrekt sind kann ich leider nicht 100% sagen.Koffein konsumieren ich ggf. 8 std. vorm schlafen gehen das letzte mal (12 mittag) und oftmals (Wochenende) sogar ca. 12 std. zuvor. Darn kann es also nicht liegen.Auch trotz Schlaftabletten (das erste mal das ich welche genommen habe, hei\u00dft ich konnte noch keine Toleranz bilden) haben sie die werte nicht ver\u00e4ndert.- Automatisches starten von Gehen/LaufenDa ich kein L\u00e4ufer bin habe ich nur gehen \"verwendet\". Als Hundebesitzer bin ich hier \u00f6fter drau\u00dfen und das automatische starten funktioniert einfach gar nicht.Initial habe ich etwa 20-30km (\u00fcber mehrere Tage) manuell getracked und dann das automatische tracking angeschalten.Dieses startet entweder gar nicht oder nachdem ich bereits wieder zur\u00fcck bin und gerade durch die Haust\u00fcrewieder rein gehe.- VibrationSelbst auf niedrig ist es noch fast zu viel wobei das gr\u00f6\u00dfere problem die dauer der vibration ist.Je nach gew\u00e4hltem training l\u00f6st der untere Knopf eine bestimmte Aktion aus (Gehen/Laufen = Neue Runde, Krafttraining = Neues Set).Hier vibriert die Uhr dann f\u00fcr gef\u00fchlt 2 Sekunden. Das mag nach einer Kleinlichkeit klingen aber treibt mich in den Wahnsinn.- Rep-Counting bei \"Kraftsport\"Liegt einfach immer gewaltig daneben und das obwohl ich meine \u00dcbungen sehr bewusst und kontrolliert durchf\u00fchre.Da mich aber haupts\u00e4chlich Herzfrequenz interessiert (da ich \u00dcbung/Sets/Reps anderweitig pflege) w\u00fcrde ich dieses feature einfach ausschalten......wenn das denn m\u00f6glich w\u00e4re- App (Android)Auch wenn diese so ziemlich alles anzeigt was man ben\u00f6tigt ist diese ein absolutes Chaos und ben\u00f6tigt ein dringendes Redesign am besten auf Basis der Material Guidelines.Das ist aber das kleinste Mako und vertretbar wenn man sich ein-/zweimal intensiver mit der app besch\u00e4ftigt.- ArmbandHier handelt es sich um ein ziemliches Standard Armband und das nervt. An und Ablegen der Uhr dauert mir einfach viel zu lange und die Schlaufe, wo man das ende des Armbands einf\u00e4delt, ist sehr schwer verschiebbar.Hat man die Uhr nun schon 50% angelegt und merkt das diese Schlaufe falsch positioniert ist, hei\u00dft es entweder wie ein bl\u00f6der \"reisen\" um es zu verschieben oder die Uhr nochmal abnehmen.Wieder eine Kleinigkeit aber trotzdem nervig.Wenigstens eine Sache die man mit 3rd-Party Armb\u00e4ndern l\u00f6sen k\u00f6nnte- ChargingKudos an Garmin daf\u00fcr das sie scheinbar immer den gleichen Ladestecker verwenden und nicht wie bsp. Fitbit mit jeder version einen neuen raus bringen.Nichts desto trotz w\u00fcrde ich mir hier wireless charging w\u00fcnschen auch wenn die Uhr sehr schnell \u00fcber Kabel l\u00e4dt.Auch wieder eine Kleinigkeit \u00fcber die man hinweg sehen kann.Fazit:Da f\u00fcr mich Sleep-Tracking genau so wichtig ist wie das tracking von Training oder sogar noch mehr da Recovery extrem wichtig ist und ich wissen muss wen mein Schlaf WIRKLICH schlecht war um den vortag zu reflektieren und ggf. Anpassungen zu machen, muss ich mich von Garmin leider verabschieden.Sleep-Tracking ist wohl noch nie eine St\u00e4rke von Garmin gewesen und auch wenn Sie einen Blog-Post haben der dar\u00fcber Spricht das es ziemlich Akkurat sein soll kann ich das einfach nicht glauben.",
            "I've had my watch for a few months now and I would now feel naked without it. I didn't wear a watch before so it took some getting used to. Firstly having something on your wrist and then the fact that you can shower with it on as well. It's so easy to use and lightweight.  I only charge the battery once a week which is great and it charges really quickly so I only have to be without it for less than an hour. It's really helped with tracking my activity levels, my calories, my steps but one of the features I love the most is the body battery.  It is so useful to know when I need to slow down, get more sleep and maybe skip the gin and tonic in order to get to 100% the next day. I don't think I could be without this watch now. It's the first smart watch I've had and I love it! No buyers remorse at all!!",

In ogni caso meglio attenersi al proprio tapis!- \ud83c\udfca\u200d\u2642\ufe0fNuoto\ud83c\udfca\u200d\u2642\ufe0f: Sono decisamente un amatore in questo campo, posso solo dirvi che tiene il conto correttamente delle vasche- \ud83d\udca8Esercizi di respirazione\ud83d\udca8: piacevoli, durata a scelta e devo dire che li ho trovati abbastanza rilassanti- \ud83c\udfb6Musica\ud83c\udfb6: lato musica perfetto, personalmente non ho avuto nessun problema a configurare le playlist, Spotify comodissimo e ha individuato le mie cuffie bluetooth in un attimo. Finalmente posso andare a correre senza il fastidio di dover tenere il telefono in tasca/mano/attaccato al braccio!- \ud83d\udcb3GarminPay\ud83d\udcb3: non c'\u00e8 molto da dire, funziona perfettamente!Lo ricomprerei senza alcun dubbio!TARGET: Volete avere qualche dato in pi\u00f9 sulla vostra attivit\u00e0 fisica? Volete avere uno smartwatch carino a vedersi senza spendere 500\u20ac? Allora questo \u00e8 l'orologio che fa per voiCONTRO: Solo la batteria che si scarica in fretta ma devo ammettere che si carica anche piuttosto velocemente quindi 1 oretta in cui state alla scrivania lo potete attaccare e trovarlo al 100%, a me dura circa 3 giorni ma non lo faccio mai arrivare allo 0%",
            "ca fait maintenant 1 semaine que j'ai cette nouvelle Garmin et j'ai essay\u00e9 aussi la VIVOACTIVE 4 juste avant pendant une semaine aussi.au premier coup d\u2019\u0153il, l\u2019\u00e9cran de la VENU n'a rien a voir...a cot\u00e9, la Vivo4 est fade et sans profondeur de couleur.les fonctions sont les meme et le cercle de la montre est plus grand sur la Vivo4 (45 cm contre 43 sur la Venu)Pour moi qui ai un petit poignet, ca compte...Le bracelet aussi est plus petit, 22 mm contre 20 sur la Venu.bien sur, un bel \u00e9cran comme ca a des d\u00e9fauts notamment sa consommation: je tiens environ 3 jours (etteinte la nuit) en mode \"connect\u00e9\". c'est a dire que la montre est coupl\u00e9e au TPH et les notifications s'affiche sur la Venu.A noter que je suis aussi en mode always on: l\u2019\u00e9cran affiche en mode minimaliste l'heure tout le temps et affiches les autres param\u00e8tres quand je tourne mon poignet. ca consomme plus mais je trouve ca plus fun.Avec la vivo4, je tenais 4 jours dans le meme mode. enfin pas tout a fait car l'always on n'existe pas mais les pixels sont toujours presents mais non eclair\u00e9s par le retro \u00e9clairage.j'ai aussi pris un bracelet cuir non Garmin.Il est bien pour tous les jours meme s'il se d\u00e9tache de temps en temps quand la montre est un peu stress\u00e9e (quand le poignet bouge fortement et d\u00e9place la montre). je pense que le syst\u00e8me d\u2019accroche rapide est un poil trop petit et la tension cr\u00e9\u00e9e a ce moment la fait sauter le bracelet.Il n'y a pas ce probl\u00e8me avec le bracelet plastique d'origine.",
            "Good features:Screen - the standout feature and the main reason to go for this watch rather than any other Garmin offeringsBattery life - surprisingly good (4-5 days continuous use without always on display) and in any case it charges up really quicklyGPS tracking - rock solid and finds signal very quickly.  It probably gives you at least 10 hours without music.Appearance - looks very goodMobile app - excellent for data vultures like meConnectivity - no problem staying connected to my smartphoneWeight - very light and comfortable to wearActivity tracking - all aspects work well, including plausible step and floor countingPulse Ox tracking - not sure what the point is but it is a lot of funNot so good featuresSleep tracking - doesn't do a good job, as it thinks you are sleeping all the time you are in bed.  However, this is common to all Garmin devices.  The Fitbit does a much better job here. This means that the body battery reading which is based partly on sleep data is highly suspect tooNotifications - OK but doesn't display icons consistently and there's not much possibility of interaction. The Fitbit does a better job hereNo microphone or speaker - Personally I don't care but it might be an issue for someScreen bezel a tad on the large side though not noticeable if watch face with dark background selectedPrice - high but you are getting a very good watch for your moneyI've owned many smart and not so smart watches, including Garmin, Pebble, Huawei, Samsung, TicWatch and Fitbit offerings. This is the best one I've owned.  In my opinion, for what it's worth, the good massively outweighs the not so good and therefore 5 stars is justified.Possible (cheaper) alternatives:Fitbit Versa 2 - also very good display and sleep tracking is excellent. Notification handling much better. Steps tracking is appalling though and it only has \"connected GPS\". There are also many connectivity problems.Huawei GT Watch 2 - phenomenal battery life and good display but notifications handling is even worse than Garmin, sleep tracking is also suspect and, although workout tracking with GPS is excellent, it cannot be shared with Strava.Garmin Vivoactive 4 - almost the same as the Venu but with transflective (i.e. always on) display and it's a bit cheaper.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0Da parecchi anni ho smartwatch Garmin al polso, soprattutto i modelli Vivoactive che acquisto fin dalla seconda versione. Questa volta volevo provare il tanto decantato schermo amoled del Venu.Lo smartwatch arriva al 100% della carica, quindi ci si pu\u00f2 dimenticare della fase di full-charge iniziale perch\u00e9 \u00e8 gi\u00e0 tutto pronto.La configurazione \u00e8 pressoch\u00e9 immediata se si dispone gi\u00e0 di un account Garmin e dell'app Connect installata.In questo caso viene anche proposta la fase di sincronizzazione dei dati (informazioni anagrafiche, attivit\u00e0, obiettivi, etc...).Rispetto a Vivoactive si pu\u00f2 scorrere tutte le informazioni in un'unica schermata, mentre sul Vivoactive ogni funzionalit\u00e0 occupava tutto il quadrante. Non sono sicuro di apprezzare questa organizzazione ma usando l'orologio mi ci abituer\u00f2 in qualche modo.L'interazione con l'interfaccia \u00e8 molto fluida tranne nel passaggio tra un quadrante e l'altro, quando si seleziona il prescelto tra le opzioni disponibili: poco male.Una delusione sono i quadranti disponibili di default: sono davvero pochi e non particolarmente interessanti visivamente anche se ovviamente si pu\u00f2 attingere allo store di Garmin. Oltre a questo,  i campi dei quadranti non possono essere editati.L'editor parte invece da un quadrante vuoto al quale aggiungere tutte le varie componenti: dati, lancette, sfondo e cos\u00ec via.Mi sono bloccato inizialmente nella prima sincronizzazione con Garmin Connect perch\u00e9 dopo qualche secondo si interrompeva andando in errore. Il motivo dell'errote era che ildisplay del telefono android andava in standby dopo 15 secondo e questo bloccava la sincronizzazione.La soluzione \u00e8 tenere il display sempre attivo per 15-20 minuti in modo che la procedura si chiuda senza intoppi.Il punto debole di questo smartwatch, come riportato anche i molti siti specializzati \u00e8 il fatto che la durata della batteria \u00e8 veramente bassa con il display always-on. Si pu\u00f2 per\u00f2 utilizzare il l'orologio in modalit\u00e0 Vivoactive:  col display sempre attivo ma con i gest disattivati.In questo modo il quadrante sempre attivo in modalit\u00e0 molto soft e in risparmio energetico.Il cinturino ed il quadrante (quello fisico) sono ottimi, eredit\u00e0 del modello precedente.In generale il mio consiglio personale \u00e8 quello di aspettare il Vivoactive 5 perch\u00e9 lo schermo amoled non giustifica una durata della batteria cos\u00ec bassa ed un prezzo cos\u00ec elevato.Dopo anni di evoluzione degli smartwatch, dover ancora fare mille trucchetti per risparmiare batteria sa tanto di amarcord degli anni '90-2000 quando la tecnologia c'era ma era ancora molto acerba.",
            "Generally a good all round product. Only discovering half of what this watch can actually do.  Everything apart from the sleep cycle is reasonably accurate. And works incredibly well under waterHowever my biggest gripe is the materials used to make the watch. Both the screen and watch surround are showing more scratches and general  wear after several months than my old apple watch series 1 did after several years, which is unacceptable for a premium product.",
            "I deeply regret buying this. The battery life is so short so a day's readings can never be accurate and unless you display the heart rate on the watch face (which uses even more battery) you can't even see the reading whilst exercising. This is bad for older people who need to make sure their heart rate is not being exceeded on something like a treadmill - the watch face just goes blank after seconds and the touch screen often does not respond. For such an expensive item I found the cheap plastic wrist strap hard on my wrist and to even get a reading it has to be worn quite tightly which causes discomfort. I would return it for a refund but stupidly threw the box away before really testing the product properly - I assumed it would live up to all the hype.",
            "Had this watch for a week. Brought as update for vio fit. The only thing better on this watch is the display so paid 350 for a screen upgrade.Battery life about 3 days if you use GPS a lot which I do for running and other activities. Seems to be accurate.My biggest complaint is it will not sinc with the garmin app store. It just jams to sort I  have to disconnect from phone and re pair to sort it out. The app store is effectively useless with this watch.Because of this and limited pre loaded apps this not a smart watch. You can get a fitness tracker that will do all this for \u00a350 with a good display I am seriously considering returning as not fit for described purpose \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21",
            "Fratello minore del Venu tondo, perde delle funzioni a mio avviso superflue per chi vuole la sostanza, nonch\u00e9 lo schermo amoled a favore di un LCD, ma c'\u00e8 differenza nell'uso quotidiano? NO, il primo ha sicuramente un impatto visivo maggiore, ma il secondo \u00e8 ben pi\u00f9 che visibile e definito. Perde il barometro questo fattore \u00e8 soggettivo se utile o meno, come lo \u00e8 il fatto di non essere completamente in acciaio inossidabile, questo significa che \u00e8 delicato? NO, al tatto si percepisce la solidit\u00e0. Il touch risponde molto bene al tocco in linea generale. Non c'\u00e8 lo schermo sempre acceso, indispensabile? NO se l'orologio ha un buon sensore del movimento, e questo ce l'ha. Per il resto la sensoristica \u00e8 la medesima, qualit\u00e0 Garmin quale non ha bisogno di descrizione. Il GPS \u00e8 rapido nella recezione del segnale, le notifiche arrivano puntuali ed \u00e8 facile rispondere(al momento nei gruppi WhatsApp NON si pu\u00f2 rispondere). L'estetica \u00e8 soggettiva ma, a mio avviso, sembra che l'azienda non l'abbia affatto trascurata. Traendo le conclusioni, un ottimo sportwatch con funzioni smart, al polso \u00e8 leggerissimo, ottimo anche per chi si approccia per la prima volta in questo mondo, l'azienda ha voluto alleggerire su quello che poteva pensando pi\u00f9 alla praticit\u00e0 che alla forma, questo lo porta ad avere un prezzo 'leggero' per le potenzialit\u00e0 offerteAGGIORNAMENTOdopo 3 mesi di utilizzo ci sono stati diversi aggiornamenti, tra cui la possibilit\u00e0 di rispondere sui gruppi Whatsapp vedendo chi ha scritto cosa, \u00e8 migliorata l'usabilit\u00e0 generale, ma una cosa che ancora mi \"pesa\" \u00e8 la scarsa adesione con le banche per GarminPay. Al di l\u00e0 di questo neo, ad oggi sono ancora soddisfatto dell'acquisto",
            "Ich habe relativ lange nach einer f\u00fcr mich passenden Smartwatch gesucht. Das bedeutet f\u00fcr mich: Eindeutiger Fokus auf Sport und Gesundheit, ansprechendes Design und nicht \"nur ein Fitnessarmband, ein Akku der mehrere Tage durchh\u00e4lt und ein ordentliches Display. Mit der Venu hatte ich den perfekten Fit gefunden - dachte ich zumindest.F\u00fcr mich konnte ich eindeutige St\u00e4rken und Schw\u00e4chen feststellen. Die m\u00f6chte ich nun einmal in Bereiche unterteilen.==================Design & Tragekomfort==================Nat\u00fcrlich ein sehr subjektiver Punkt. Ich finde die Uhr optisch sehr ansprechend. Auch den Tragekomfort fand ich sehr angenehm, was f\u00fcr eine Uhr, die man auch beim Schlafen tr\u00e4gt durchaus wichtig ist. Teilweise kritisiert wurde, dass die Uhr zu gro\u00dfen Teilen aus Plastik ist. Das stimmt und bei rund 380\u20ac kann ich die Kritik teilweise nachvollziehen. Wenn jedoch bedacht wird, dass die Uhr eine Sport-/Allrounderuhr ist, finde ich die Priorit\u00e4ten gut gesetzt. Den Punkt Design & Tragekomfort w\u00fcrde ich als klare St\u00e4rke einordnen.=======Akku=======Der Akku ist auf jeden Fall ein Punkt, bei dem diese Uhr der Konkurrenz voraus ist. Allerdings zehrt auch jede kleine Einstellung am Akku. Niemand stellt die Uhr auf die dunkelste Helligkeitsstufe und deaktiviert fast alle Features. Display etwas heller gestellt -> Akku runter, Auto-Synchronisation -> Akku runter, SpO2 Sensor nicht dauerhaft aus -> Akku runter. Von den beworbenen 5 Tagen bleiben realistisch ca. 3 Tage. Mit nachts aktiven SpO2-Sensor, 5 Aktivit\u00e4ten pro Woche und 3/4-Displayhelligkeit geht es auf ca. 2 bis 2,5 Tage runter. Ich w\u00fcrde den Punkt als kleine St\u00e4rke sehen. Man h\u00e4tte die Marketing-Keule aber etwas realistischer ansetzen k\u00f6nnen.=========Funktionen=========Insgesamt wie gesagt ein Sportallrounder. Die Features sind haupts\u00e4chlich Sportfokussiert mit kleineren, alltagstauglichen Smartwatch-Funktionen. Einiges ist jedoch eher Spielerei. Der SpO2-Sensor ist z.B. nicht so in der App implementiert, dass er sp\u00fcrbaren Nutzen bringt. Als bisher non-Garmin-Nutzer fand ich auch die Body Battery Funktion sehr spannend. Auch die hat sich f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich jedoch eher als Spielerei entpuppt. Mit den Funktionen war ich insgesamt zufrieden. Die Aktivit\u00e4tsaufzeichnung ist gut und detailliert. Was ich mir gew\u00fcnscht h\u00e4tte, ist eine Verarbeitung der Details zu einem Score, \u00e4hnlich wie es Fitbit macht. Da bin ich mir nicht sicher, ob ich stets zu blind war das zu finden oder ob es keine simple Zusammenfassung gibt.Insgesamt f\u00fcr mich ein solider Punkt, allerdings nichts, was die Uhr ausmacht.=========Sensoren=========Dieser Punkt ist in meinem Fall die absolute Achillessehne der Uhr. Den m\u00e4\u00dfig sinnvollen SpO2-Sensor habe ich bereits erw\u00e4hnt. Allerdings sind auch restliche Messungen bei meiner Uhr absolut Katastrophal gewesen. D.h. die Uhr hatte eine sehr seltsame Interpretation meines Schlafes. Oft soll ich schon um 19:00 Uhr eingeschlafen sein. War ich um 02:30 Uhr wach, war das egal. Je nachdem habe ich dort angeblich leicht oder in der REM-Phase geschlafen. Das hat sich dazu entwickelt, dass nicht die Uhr meinen Schlaf, sondern ich die Uhr \u00fcberwacht habe. Treppen wurden inkorrekt gez\u00e4hlt. Ich habe mich einen Tag nur im Haus bewegt. Sprich jede Treppe nach oben = Treppe nach unten. Gemessen: 16 Treppen hoch, 22 runter. Beim Stress war ich bei einer anstrengend Innenstadt-Autofahrt absolut tiefenentspannt, aber beim Abend vorm Fernseher war ich wohl panisch gestresst. Bei bisherigen Fitnessuhren hatte ich einen Ruhepuls von 49-53. Damals habe ich noch mehr Sport gemacht. Trotz heute weniger Sport attestiert mir die Venu einen Ruhepuls von 42-47.Diese Fehler haben mich dazu bewegt, die Uhr zur\u00fcckzusenden.======Fazit======Die Uhr ist ein passender Allrounder, mit noch einigerma\u00dfen akzeptablen Preis-/Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis. Das w\u00e4re mein Fazit, wenn die Messungen funktioniert h\u00e4tten. Ich wei\u00df nicht, ob es nur an meinem Ger\u00e4t lag. An mir sollte es nicht liegen, bei allen bisherigen Uhren hatte ich zumindest nie derartige Probleme. Mit dem absoluten Totalausfall in Sachen Sensoren ist die Venu meiner Erfahrung nach eine schlechte Wahl. Soetwas sollte bei dem Preis auch nicht im Ausnahmefall vorkommen.",
            "Do yourself a favour and avoid the seller I used (they were (likely still are) in Spain) so I got hit for import tax, I tried to cancel once I realised but they were extremely unhelpful.  I won't name and shame, but if you're going for it, find one in the Uk (or your country)That's the downside, the upside is the device itself, its superb. Does everything my Apple Watch does without the pretentiousness of it, and unlike apple, Garmin seem to know how to make batteries too!Well recommended",
            "I have recently upgraded from the Garmin v\u00edvosmart HR as I was looking for a fitness tracker that looks more like a watch. I am very please with the all the features of the watch and the ability to change the watch face to suit your needs is a great feature. the big clear display makes it easy to read while exercising. The Garmin App is also great and links to my fitness pal app so I can check my calorie intake etc. The battery life is OK but does depend on how you set the watch up based on the setting I have the watch will last around 3-4 days .I would recommend this watch",
            "J'ai re\u00e7u cette montre connect\u00e9e il y a deux jours . J'ai choisi cet article parce que je suis une habitu\u00e9e de la marque puisque j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu des Vivofit 2 et 3 .Mais pourquoi prendre un mod\u00e8le plus cher ??  C'est parce qu'une geek sommeille en moi  et que je voulais pouvoir suivre mon rythme cardiaque \u00e0 l'effort sans porter de ceinture autour du thorax . Ce qui m'a s\u00e9duite aussi c'est la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00e9couter de la musique \u00e0 partir de la montre sans trimballer mon portable en ballade ou pendant un exercice . En parlant de musique ce qui m'a fait \u00e9carter la Fitbit c'est qu'on ne peut t\u00e9l\u00e9charger des listes musicales qu'\u00e0 partir de Deezer ou Amazon et seulement piloter Spotify sur votre portable  et que je suis abonn\u00e9e \u00e0 Spotify . Avec la Venu sq musique vous pourrez t\u00e9l\u00e9charger des titres \u00e0 partir de Spotify , Deezer Amazon entre autres et votre propre musique ( semble t'il , j'ai pas encore essay\u00e9 ) . Sinon la montre est tr\u00e8s compl\u00e8te avec plein d'exercices qu'on peut surveiller dont l'elliptique , le tapis en salle , et le v\u00e9lo en salle ( \u00e0 condition de disposer d'un accessoire compteur de vitesse ou de cadence \u00e0 fixer sur le v\u00e9lo , j'attends le mien ) . Sinon au niveau des param\u00e8tres physiologiques , c'est tr\u00e8s complet avec des choses amusantes comme le niveau de stress ou le compteur d'\u00e9nergie interne . Dans ce qui compte vraiment les pulsations sont  justes ( j'ai control\u00e9 ) et le sommeil aussi dans la mesure ou on se couche pour dormir et qu'on se l\u00e8ve d'un bond d'un seul , sans flemmarder , ni lire , ni surveiller tristement les statistiques du Covid sur sa tablette .... l'oxym\u00e9trie n\u00e9cessite une immobilit\u00e9 absolue pour bien fonctionner .Une chose est sure c'est que cette montre  occupe , meme avec une grosse habitude des logiciels informatiques la r\u00e9gler pour l'adapter \u00e0 vos possibilit\u00e9s sportives est quand meme un peu compliqu\u00e9 et le manuel d'utilisation t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeable aide mais n'explique pas tout . Ceci dit j'ai eu un petit souci avec un \u00e9cran de veille dont je n'arrivais pas \u00e0 me d\u00e9barrasser , un petit coup de chat avec  Garmin et c'\u00e9tait arrang\u00e9 . Donc vous n'etes pas seul !! Il y a aussi le site IQ Connect ou vous pourrez t\u00e9l\u00e9charger des cadrans et des applications dont Spotify  , la plupart gratuites . Cot\u00e9 esth\u00e9tique , elle est vraiment \u00e9l\u00e9gante meme si un peu grosse pour mes petits poignets , mais l'\u00e9cran est bien lisible . Cot\u00e9 batterie c'est comme de tout , si vous la sollicitez beaucoup il faudra la charger souvent .

            "I just \"upgraded\" to this watch after having a Pebble 2. I can't believe that this watch cost twice the price and functions half as well.The battery is atrociously bad. I charged it last night and it lost almost 50% while I was sleeping!The UI is a confusing mess. There are two separate Settings apps. There are three separate app launchers.The button functionality is a mess e.g. for media controls the top button is Back, the bottom button is Forward, the middle button is Close. Why is the middle button Close!? Why isn't it Play/Pause!?There's a heap of bloatware apps that you can't uninstall. There's also invisible apps that you can uninstall, but you can't run those apps.WTF is the Fossil app?? I think it might actually be a broken app because it literally does nothing. This on a brand new device!The strap is also garbage. It's a $400 watch with the cheapest-quality $2 strap. What a rip-off.",
            "The battery life is terrible. It doesn't last a day the first time I got it I returned it thinking it was faulty but it's wasn't that's just the way it is. There's battery extenders but why have a smart watch if you're turning off all the features. Note the battery extender even turns off looking at the time. There is also a customised option but again why have a smart watch if you can't use the features? Including reading the time.Plus there no other way to charge it other than what is supplied with it.It's badly designed. When you exercise at the gym the knob where you turn it off constantly turns the watch off when you lift your wrist. You hold a weight up it turns off. You put your hands on your waist it turns off. It's just bad design.It never works when you want it to in terms of calling, sending messages etc.  Half the time Google commands don't work, there's an unknown error etc.And after having GPS, there isn't even maps loaded into it. You can't navigate from your watch. When you're walking you don't really really want to be looking and guided by your phone you want your smart watch to help you navigate.I used to have a Sony smartwatch. This was so long ago and to me it's way better than this one. Lasted ages, could charge from a USB, maps worked... The world has gone backwards with smart watches.I would have returned this if I could... Unfortunately I got a small ding on it... That's right it's not very hardy either. Basically just brushed against something and it got a ding.",
            "The phone paired easily and went through most of the setup process without issues. I then left it on the charger while it was still updating a few apps. A few hours later when I went back to it, it was on the clock screen and I could no longer get back into the menus. Flashes on and off, tried resetting (hard and soft) multiple times, same issue.So disappointing. . Spent hours trying multiple online suggestions to get it to work but it's still broken and all on day 1. I wouldn't recommend this watch to anyone. Such a waste of my time and now I have to figure out how to get my money back for it.... Tried to call Fossil \"customer service\" but they're closed on a public holiday.",
            "It is a shame but this watch has had a problem just a few days after the window for return closed, we are now having to send it back for return and not even being offered the opportunity for refund even though it is less than 6 weeks old, we have lost faith in the reliability of this watch. On top of that having sent it for repair earlier this week we are now in receipt of a text which says the repair centre has closed due to the COVID situationMy son is so disappointed as he was using it to track his exercise routines while in lockdownI would like a refund given the newness of this watch",
            "The battery life for the watch was really poor. You charge it and its gone, I have to put this device on charge for atleast 3 times in a day.",
            "Battery didn't even last one day, returned it a couple of days after buying",
            "Good price. Was as ordered. Expedient delivery.",
            "Reliable and does what it needs to do",
            "Sub standard product, worst customer service.",
            "I have used gen 3 smartwatch and i have also used gen 5 smartwatch\u2022 G pay doesn't work and gets disappeared after update it only works in 7 countries as of now.\u2022 whenever i recieve a call on watch the voice breaks almost every time. Voice is not clear\u2022 google assistent does not give messages in voice and don't respond to ok google after turning it on in setting.\u2022 os wear play store sucks and thier are very less useful applications. It has very less content\u2022 You can not download any songs but after using play app of google you can listen to limited songs and if you want to download it than pay for premium.COMING TO THE PROS\u2022 charges really fast almost within one hour and lasts for a day. For continuous use it will last around 3-4 hours.\u2022 Nice design and good finish. Speaker has a decent voice.Giving it one star because it's not worth paying 23k",
            "I'm writing this review after 1 week of usage. Android wearOS is smooth. You can install Apps from PlayStore directly on watch through wifi. It comes with 1 GB RAM and 8 Gigs of memory so you can download or stream music on the go through Google Play Music or Spotify. Google Pay does not work in India through watch.AOD (always on display) works great and helps in saving battery.You can use Google fit or strava or mapmywalk+ to track physical activity.Touch screen responsiveness is great.Google maps and Google Translate can be downloaded on watch.Battery life is 1 day with most features ON but you get 4 options also:Daily 1 dayExtended 2 to 3 daysCustom as per requirementTime only 1 weekInitially, i thought battery life is less, but now I'm pretty satisfied with the performance and features.Giving 1 star less for the battery (which can be improved in the next version)",
            "This review is just for iPhone users. I use iPhone 7 and had an assumption that everything will work as expected but that isn\u2019t the case. May be I did not do proper research before I bought this watch. However to ease out for iPhone users, I am letting my observation out. So people can know what they are going to get when they buy.Features as of now:1. Only notifies you that you got a message along with the sender\u2019s name for apps such as Whatsapp, sms etc but you cannot reply or read the message from the watch.2. You will get notified on who is calling with the name and the number, you can either choose to attend or reject, however you cannot speak using the watch.Note: Just browsed the internet and came to know that the OTA update would hit us before the year end. This will enable us to make calls and attend the calls and speak using the watch. Until then we need to wait.For android they have all liberty to use and no restrictions.Now coming to the look of the watch and performance.1. Watch looks stylish and cool.2. Navigation is smooth and easy.3. Notifications hit the phone without any lag.Rest I will update once I start using. This is my first day. I will rate 5 stars once the proper update is pushed.****************************************************So as I mentioned before OTA update got pushed two weeks back. Now I am able to take calls and make calls using my watch.Speaker is audible and mic is also good while I used my watch.However, you need use Google fit app for fitness tracking as Apple Health app will not work well with this watch.I have changed my stars from 3 to 5. Fossil did what they committed\ud83d\ude0a",
            "The watch is amazing! But the only downfall is the speaker, the speaker cracks when I take calls on the watch and the other person is barely audible. Is there a fix? Cause this is the only thing that'sExtremely bad about it",
            "Good voice call quality, yet to know whether it can be corrected.. Otherwise gd featuresCan be connected to WiFiU can customize watch faces along with synchronization of FB n InstaSome disparity in steps walked n calories used",
            "Really I didn't even wanted to give 2star but this rating is only for looks otherwise watch is very confusing sometime it connect the call sometime not Google assistance is working but not speaking no guide inside nothing is explained and for backup if u go it will give u 24 hours backup if not used heavily and if used heavily it will give 5-7 hours really wasted my money:(",
            "My all time favorite...dis is awesome..",
            "Worst battery even compared to gen 4. Wear Os has very limited functionality. very few apps in appstore. Continuous heart rate sensor is battery sucker. 30 mins usage of continous heart rate brought 100% charge to 30 %.Not at all worth the money. better go for another fitness trackers which can satisfy all the possibilities of wear Os with very less price Eg:amaze fit.I bought it because of the new processor SD3100 expecting latest firmware updates(Wear Os 3).",
            "It's a great product don't get me wrong and the design it's fantastic, functionality wise It's great too but it's battery life is absolutely not acceptable for the price range of 400 Canadian dollars.I only had this watch for 3 or 4 days now and I have to turn most features off so I can get by the day without the watch dying on me. What's the point of a smartwatch when you have to turn more than half of its features so it doesn't die on you. So with that said I'm probably going to be returning it.",
            "I got a defective product. The product is not booting up and it's not even charging. I connected the charger and waited for a long time but I couldn't see any charging indicator or any other sign on the display. The display is always blank. I ordered a brand new product and waited for nearly 10 days for the product and finally I got a defective product. Also the watch was covered with a lot of dust. It didn't looked like a new product. I am really disappointing with the service and I am returning the product.",
            "After using it for 17 days now I can talk about this watch.1. Great design \ud83d\udc4d2. Light weight feels like you wearing some normal watch3. The OS is fast but when battery reaches to about 15% or Below it slows down a bit.4. There was an issue regarding taking calls on watch that it was not clear and voice breaks completely whenever you receive or make a call, Thanx to fossil for working on this solution ASAP today 17/10/2019 they have released an update and after updating my watch it has completely resolved. Now it's clear no breaking sound or any kind of distortion is there. Well done.5. It detects your type of workout and reps automatically like Push ups, Squats, cardio etc. But some of the exercise like incline or decline bench press you have to manually correct the watch for detecting workout as it detects it bench press only and you have to manually select the weight too.6. The worst part of it is battery life, although it charges fast like in 1 hr but it lose its back up much faster as it has almost every function which we can seek in a smartwatch.\u2022If you using it just for time with flight mode on it can go on more then 24hrs of battery life.\u2022If you using Bluetooth on and connected to your phone with notification coming directly on your watch it will last 15 to 18hrs depending on your use.\u2022If you using it for taking call on watch it will last 10 to 15hrs again depending on how frequently you using it.\u2022If using with Bluetooth,Wifi and GPS on your watch it may last for 5 to 6hrs max.Suggestion turn off  functions you not using frequently like GPS, heart rate monitor, wifi, speaker etc to increase it battery backup.At last I can say it's a great product with only one flaw of battery backup otherwise it's great hope this new update makes any changes to battery life also.Thanx",
            "This is my first smartwatch and I bought it after a lengthy research considering how pathetic the Android smartwatch market is.This watch just blew me off with its looks and performance. A lot of people in my social and work circle take a second glance at this when passing by and that's a sign of the superb design of the watch.While the battery could have been expected to last longer than a day, it is not too much of a hassle. I got easily around 20-21 hrs of battery life with the daily mode option.Answering calls is a breeze from the watch and you can reply to whatsapp messages within the watch itself either by typing or using voice commands.The single most important and stellar feature of this watch is GPS Navigation which is extremely useful while riding a bike or when you are out for a fitness workout.Don't worry about the price. Close your eyes and go for this !",
            "One of the best smart watch of the fossil. With 1gb of ram and 8gb of internal memory makes it more better and working more efficiently. Slightly disappointed with battery life else everything is good",
            "The latest Gen 5 Carlyle smartwatch from Fossil is by far the most attractive & comfortable smart watch I have owned. Being light with a slimline profile, it's ideal for wearing with both casual or formal attire - something that cannot be said for some of the chunkier smart watches on the market today. It\u2019s an elegant watch, especially when paired with the leather straps, however the straps are interchangeable, so can be easily swapped for a silicone or metal strap of some sort to suit ones style. It's also waterproof up to 30M, so you don\u2019t even need to bother taking it off when having a shower afterwards.The watch is running WEAR 2.0 which includes all the standard WearOS features we're familiar with, however a few additional points standout on the Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle:\u2022They have provided customisable battery use management options; There are 3 pre-set modes, plus you can customise which features are turned on/off, and when. I\u2019ve had it running with most features turned on (GPS, heart monitor, wifi, Bluetooth, etc), but generally keep \u201cAlways On\u201d off. By the end of the day there is between 20-30% battery life left. There\u2019s also a \u201cTime Only\u201d function if battery life gets critically low.\u2022The charging disk is all multi-directional, so as long as it is in contact with the back off the watch, it will charge it. No need to line up connection points, etc which is very handy. Also charges from 0% to 100% in around an hour.\u2022The Tiles feature is also a nice addition to the WEAR OS experience, allowing to customise which tiles are shown when swiping left. The OS only supports a handful of tiles such as Google Fit, calendar, calculator, etc so will be interesting to see how this feature develops as new tiles are added.Finally, the performance is top notch, with no glitching or latency when navigating the menus or apps, which has been a problem with other smart watches I\u2019ve owned. It's capable of pairing and fully functional with both Android and iOS smartphones.Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle smartwatch and would highly recommend it to both seasoned smartwatch owners and new smart watch converts alike.",

            "To start with the watch i recieved got it in a day's time, but the delivery package was weird \ud83d\ude02For a small watch they packed it in a big carton as big as the ones used to store mangoes.\ud83e\udd23My requirements were - The watch should be supported by Google,Should have functions like a Speaker to recieve calls and call someone,and should be able to play music,Also should have Speech to text feature in it. Also have google assistant in it,Never wanted Bixby hence did not go for a samsung gear.I dont like wearing my watch while working out and find it distracting hence never searched for a Fit watch.So i suggest prior to buying or investing your money , make a list of your requirements and see if you actually need it or not.Pros about the watch-Call Quality - perfect.wifi Bluetooth Connections - Great - found no issues.looks Rich and quite big.Get an 8Gb storage in it and can store music, Also download playstore apps for it which i loved although its all due to WEAR OS.Google assistant works smoothly in it.at 1st it had some glitches so i had to reset the watch and after that it's now working fine.Its like a phone on your hand simple.Cons -Battery life - that's a little too harsh and drains quite quickly. but that's if your apps installed are running, or the other features are kept on.The firmware- got a software update instantly but found that there's a minor slowdown there in the fluidity of the watch interface but nonetheless it hardly is noticeable. Other than this i found it to be perfect and worth it's money.if you have the money go for it, dont think twice.Samsung gears offer much lesser festures in this price so think about it\ud83d\ude42",
            "The watch looks elegant on hand. Display is amoled and is smooth and clear. Below are the the pros and cons.ProsLook. - You will fall in love with this design at first sight.Wear os - This is one of the budgetary watch which runs on googles wear os.Watch faces - Multiple and multiples of watch faces and most of them are classy.Microphone - Works good and sound from speaker is also good.Notifications - One of the good and most usable feature. We can reply for all the notifications as same as how we can do it on phone.Light weight.Cons.Wear os - Software is too buggy that some time connectivity cracks. Wifi disconnects frequently . While we are on call microphone works smoothly but speaker cracks. That makes other ends voice barely audible for me.Battery back up - Battery back up is very poor. You can only use it for mx. 7-8hrs with moderate use.Fitness tracking - Not at all accurate and it will never remind you to move if you are sitting idle for long time.GPS - GPS is built in only but it works smoothy only when connected with phone.Play music - The main thing I have purchased this watch is for that I don't need to bring phone to hear music while going for jogging and I can directly connect to my Bluetooth headset with smart watch and play music. But I have struggled sync local downloaded music with Google's play music app and at last i have downloaded some third-party app and done it.Verdict - This watch is perfect for people who are using android phones and looking for apple watch kind of feeling.For 21k it worth it only when google fixes their buggy wear OS. Only software part and battery back up needs improvements.",
            "Great product , battery lasts for one day with moderate use. Fonts are little small even if opt for large. Elegant look .Can manage with wear OS mobile app.",
            "It has been 3 days i am using this. Lets talk about only the cons:There is only one i saw i.e btterybackup.In daily mode it works 8 hours. Its only when you are not opening th watch means ideal condition everything is open in daily mode.If you are using it and searching anything on it then hardly 3 to 4 hours. So it is not for those who use it heavily.Pro:If it is tight on your hand with always on display the very first impression you get that its really a watch its not like samsung and other watch which look like toy in hand.All feature is amazing.UPDATE: Fossil update their OS now their is no fuzzy sound while you are on call with watch you can listen clrystal clear voice of other and you too can talk without issue.I really loved that watch the only thing is that battery backup if that will be taken care off then it will beat all watches of other brands including apple too coz the named watch is really suit on it coz its a watch not a phone and smart watch means all features of phn in it.You will really not dissappointed if you take it i am 100% sure . The only issue is battry backup but the good thing in it is that its charge also quickly so really good for those who travels in a car they can opt the charging there. All feature of phn is in it. So highly recommend it dor those who didnt care about battry backup.Other modes are also their they will extend your battry upto 2 days and also 4 days if you set time only mode than it will work like ordinary analog watch so its depend on you what type of user you are. Whats app other message n all things you can control through it. Google assistant and even you can type through watch its really easy due to dragging method. So thing twice if battry backup is not important for you if you have small power bank then its the beast for you otherwise its is not for you.",
            "Pros- Google Assistant - admittedly, the best thing about this watch. bought it for this reason. Google assistant will only work when your PHONE is connected to WiFi, so please note that.- Feature-Rich(ish) - Watch capabilities are up there, you can do a lot with it. Tinkered around with a lot of settings, accessibility settings are good and work too.- Looks sleekCons- Doesn't stay paired with iPhones - really. Had to re pair the damn thing every two hours, which leaves you at a disadvantage. This is the sole reason/purpose that I have returned my product. Waste of money (and time) for me.- Some watchfaces are really out there and make it hard to read the time. What the damn were they thinking? That's the priority for a watch. But okay, the regular watchfaces make it easy to do that, but the collaborations they made for watchfaces really didn't turn out very well.- Google Assistant (yes, both a pro and a con) - Sadly assistant would misinterpret voice commands. maybe that is saying more for the mic than google assistant, you decide.- Doesn't reflect events made in calendar, notifications amiss (iPhone) and scheduled alarms don't really go off all the time (?) which I don't understandHope this helps. Solid watch, but I believe it will work best with Android/Google Phones.",
            "I received a product which looks like the original but the centre crown button is missing! Either this is a clone or something has happened! 23k spent and this I recieved!! Just amazing work!! People who don't know will definitely get fooled! Please look into it Amazon",
            "Unfortunately I only owned this watch for three weeks before I had to sell it on my company's \"Buy and Sell\" forum. The watch itself is beautiful, and WearOS is solid, but besides using the device as an everyday watch, I also had planned on using it for my fitness needs. I run and swim multiple times a week, and from what I had read online the Fossil Gen 5 should have easily met my needs. However, after my first run with Google Fit I discovered that this app (the default for running activities) does NOT track split/interval times. This should be a very basic requirement for any running watch. So, instead, I downloaded a number of different apps. First, Strava... but Strava only tracks runs if tethered to a phone, and I am not going to bring my phone with me on my runs. Over the course of many days I tried Nike Run Club, Ghostracer, MyRunning App, MapMyRun and Adidas Running, and either these apps did not use the watch's built in GPS, or would inexplicably stop recording my run in the midst of the run!In regard to the swimming, Google Fit does not have a swim tracker at all, so I had to download a couple of alternatives. Swim.com was the better of the two, but it did not do a great job of accurately counting my lengths, and then trying to stop the timer at the end of my swim was ridiculously complicated.Something else I did not mention above, when I do run I like to listen to music. On my current watch (which I have gone back to) I can listen to my Spotify playlists, even when offline. The Spotify app on the Fossil Gen 5 does not have an offline option, so again, to listen to Spotify I would have to bring my phone with me. It does allow offline music from Google Music, but since that is not where my music lives, that did not do me any good.So, in the end I had to sell the watch. It just did not work for me, but if you were looking for a great smartwatch, and the fitness aspects are not a priority, I would say the Fossil Gen 5 would be good for you. If, on the other hand, fitness tracking is important, I would look elsewhere.",
            "The battery is absolute garbage. It's unable to do everything it says it can while also lasting for over 8 hours.  It's an absolute shame to have such a neat gadget be so seriously hindered by battery longevity.  I hate having to charge it multiple times in a day.If I'm going to give credit where credit is due, it's actually very well made. I accidentally dragged it across a buildings stucko siding while working and it was blemish free. Not a scratch, quite amazing, and so it doesn't require a screen protector. It's also quite water proof and can exist in the shower with you.",
            "Phone calls not working in watch.",
            "Over heating issue is there.. Battery is draining in rapid speed . Hardly you can use for 3 hours. I can't risk my life for this product because it's over heating at your hand when you use for few minutes. Not worthy of buying..  I had a great respect for fossil but now i doubt that!!!! I no longer wanted that !!!",
            "This is the worst option in terms of user friendlyness, to the extent that it doesn't even have an app of its own to show statistics. This just doesn't pair with Android or iOS. This is a gift I gave my dad and I regret having given him a piece of junk. I use a fitbit and I think it is much much advanced than a Gen 5 Fossil. It is a dumb watch, not a smart watch, for sure",
            "People I bought this watch with a lot of expectations and desire. But I was sorely disappointed with the watches battery life.The battery life is soooo pathetic that you would be lucky to get  8 hours of battery life on an active day.The battery will begin to drain with each minute the screen is on. Once it is off the charger you have to restrain yourself from interacting with it.The marketed battery life is1 to 1.5 day on Daily mode2 to 4 days on Extended modeThese numbers are applicable only if you leave the watch somewhere and let it sit idly and do not touch it. But you do not buy a smartwatch packed with features rivalling Apple watch to let it sit at home right???Now, this is not Fossil's fault. The build quality, the screen quality, the buttons, the crowns, the chain, everything which is tangible is exceptional.The fault is of Google and its Wear OS. Google has totally abandoned Wear OS and not launching any updates. Even features like sleep tracking, VO2 Max, etc are being worked on and being added by Fossil.Save your self the trouble and buy something else with a different OS. Stay away from Wear OS.",
            "You can see both the versions in the pic. Other than the wear OS update, rest everything serves same purpose in both the generations. Small cosmetic changes are there in line with the new price tag.No luck on battery back-up. Hardly serves one day, however if u attend two calls (hardly 5min each) in your watch (which is the purpose), it's dead within next few hours. Just good to use full day or even three days without using any of the smart functions. Activating the bluetooth may drains your phone battery too. In short we buy a smart watch and use it in battery save mode just like a normal wrist watch!",
            "The product came on time. Really like my watch - very elegant looking. The only problem I am having is the charge that does not last long - not even for a day. I have to figure out if this is normal for this watch or I have to disable some of the apps so that it doesn't eats up the charge. Otherwise the watch is great. I really want to use it.",
            "Look wise great but need to improve on battery and speaker. Hope they will fix these issue. Apart from that watch gives a rich look.",
            "Bought \"used\" from amazon warehouse deals , at a $130 discount. The watch is in near-impeccable condition aside from a very minor blemish on the dark metal housing. I will be monitoring the battery level for the next week or so, and will update my review if anything seems off. So far, it works great and is very snappy when compared to my old Wear24. I installed a mesh strap and bought a 4-pack screen protector for it so it will be in good hands. Will update if anything goes wrong.",
            "El reloj tiene un dise\u00f1o muy bonito, y es bastante r\u00e1pido en su manejo de apps con Android Wear OS. El gran problema que le encuentro es que la bater\u00eda dura muy poco tiempo, en uso normal con notificaciones y recibiendo algunas llamadas mediante el reloj, posiblemente dure unas 6 a 8 horas, lo cual lo vuelve poco atractivo en vista de que estando fuera de casa al menos necesitas 10 horas de uso continuo. Es cierto que tiene varios men\u00fas configurables para hacer rendir m\u00e1s la bater\u00eda, sin embargo, comparado con otros relojes del mismo tipo e incluso mas o menos del mismo precio, su bater\u00eda es de poca duraci\u00f3n.",
            "As my headline says \"the best you can get right now\", it doesn't mean the watch is a fabulous piece of work.No doubt the design is really great, the feeling is premium and the controls are minimal yet effecient, this watch does have flaws.One of the best part of the watch is the display. It is crisp, vivid and bright, so you can still see your time out in the sunshine.Lots of amazing watch faces to choose from, really customizable except for the 5 tiles restriction.Fully compatible with all Android phones unlike flagship watches from Apple or Samsung.The software is a bit buggy, but still feels smooth and the stock experience is unreal.The battery (if you configure your watch effeciently (no continuous heart rate monitoring, no wifi, no nfc, all time Bluetooth on)) will last you one day and a half unless you use the watch constantly (in which, you'll go from 100 to 0 in 3-4hrs)The speaker is decent, the microphone is also decent.Overall I'm glad I bought this watch at the right time. Hopefully things will get better in the future with the upcoming graphene batteries and better smartphone-flagship chipsets.",
            "Hi,I purchased a Fossil Gen5 watch which was delivered on 20th June and right from.the start there have been consistent issues with the product.1. The package that I recieved already had the watch out of the grooves.2. The watch stopped working in the middle of an update (for 2 days)3. The battery drained out in 30 min (from 70% to 0)4. Now the watch has stopped working beacuse it just won't charge.I have tried multiple power sources but it still doesn't seem to be working.This incompetence in product quality control or vendor verification baffles me. The only reason I did not return this product is the fact that reviews said the OS takes time to stabalise but this is just a defective product from an unreliable vendor that needs to be checked right away.I would have been ok to take this watch to the Fossil service station but the lockdown has made this impossible and the date of return on the app seems to have eneded.I'm requesting for a complete refund on this product since there's no point suffering with a high value defective product.Request your immediate attention",
            "Well, to start with I just moved over from the iOS ecosystem to Android world, and love my new, shiny Samsung Galaxy Note 10. So, this Fossil Gen 5 release date was Godsend to coincide with my decision to switch to Android and Note 10 release as my old Apple Watch won't work with my new Android phone.Absolutely floored by the slim design of Fossil Watch, how easily it connected with my Note 10. Aesthetics wise I like it more than my Apple Watch; even got praises on how well it looks.And the fascination just stopped there. I wish the screen could be more brighter. I have set the brightness at 5 (maximum) and I still thinks it's not bright enough. And the battery life. Within just 6 hours of use, my watch came down from 100% to 24%! Well, the watch boasts of \"Extended\" and \"Time Only\" modes in addition to the \"Daily\" mode (with all the smart features enabled). I looked at the \"Extended\" mode setting to find out that all the features are set to OFF in the watch except you can hit the crown to wake up your watch, notifications and vibrations are On, and the Bluetooth is available from 6 AM - 10 PM only. All the cool options, such as Speaker, WiFi, Touch-to-wake, Tilt-to-Wake, NFC, OK Google detect options are disabled.Come on; I bought a smart watch for a reason. Otherwise, $295 would have fetched me a very stunning and performant non-smart watch.Let's not even imagine what the third, \"Time Only\", option would turn my watch into. Perhaps, every time I needed to see time in my watch, I had to call Fossil customer care and then they would have either enabled the display for 10 seconds or just told me over the phone what I wanted to know from my watch!Perhaps, I am being harsh but I can't help it when I am coming from a perfectly fine smartwatch (Apple Watch) that won't work with Android phones, and you're just left to this.Fossil, I urge you to work on the battery drainage and brightness things as the top-priority things to fix in this watch. Otherwise, you will just end up with customers like me who are not all happy with this purchase. I won't recommend this watch, at least not until Fossil fixed the battery issue at the minimum!",
            "I bought it as a gift. Unfortunately the battery life is extremely bad. After charging 100% and not even using it, it gets discharged within 5 hours. And it doesn't come with warranty. We have to go to the fossil retail showroom to get the warranty which is not convenient. Worst part is battery life . And I could exchange only within 15 days of purchase but could not exchange it due to some reasons . Now it's too late. Please don't get it. If u want to get it, better go to a proper showroom and get it",
            "This Watch is great wear os watch, but the battery life is just bad..It could not even last 12 hours (Always on display, Bluetooth, Notification on rest all off).Also just want to put it there, in wear os you could not find native sleep tracking, had to use 3rd party apps.. which aren't great.",
            "Slightly overpriced, just \"slightly\" because it still has a cheap-ish feel to it especially with some of the bands which you wouldn't have expected them to skimp out on but arguably one of the best you can get for WearOS as an overall...so ultimately can't complain and that's why I gave it 5 stars, massive step up from other WearOS watches I've owned. Though the battery life is a lil underwhelming initially but I've been told it gets slightly better over time as the watch calibrates itself. Will update further down the line if I end up having issues with the charging ring, because those were the main concerns I've seen from most reviews and people who've owned the watch for a longer time they noted the battery life and the charging ring wearing out quickly.",
            "I guess i can rate something below 1 star.This is the worst product from fossil. Doesn't make any news in wearing it. Totally no battery back up and the Google wear sucks big time. Very less features compared to samsung OS. For such a heavy price tag this is surely an useless product.",

            "It was delivered in less than 24 hours which was not working so I asked for replacement.  Received another one which worked for 10 days and just as replacement window got over, it stopped working. It's did not start. Amazon does not listen now and Fossil company does not help in replacement. This is 2nd experience with Fossil, my boss had same issue a year back.",
            "Fossil made one of the most beautiful, accessible and useful watch for android users on the market.Two downsides:1-NOT FOSSIL'S FAULT AND MIGHT GET BETTER SOMEDAY: Wear OS lacks something. It's as if google wasn't putting the time and energy it deserves to be a fair competitor to Apple watch. If google decides to get their hands out their but It might just get better because it is purely software.2-FOSSIL'S FAULT AND YOU'RE STUCK WITH IT : Battery suck. I tried to convince myself that it wasn't that bad so I bought it anyway. The first day I received it I played with it and could drain the battery in like an hour and half with heavy usage. Your watch will barely stay smart for the whole day, it starts to change profile to save battery life at like 5PM. Put a better battery in this thing and add like 50$ to the price tag and I'd give it 4-5 stars hands down",
            "Sadly, I will never suggest anyone purchase a Fossil smart watch. Fossil has refused to keep their smart watches working with Google Assistant from Mid-2019. As per the rep \"Jay\", they are \"aware of the issue\" and are \"working with Google\" to fix the issue that at this point is 2.5 years old. Which is nearly how long this watch has been on he market, suggesting it hasnt ever been capable of the features listed in the description above...Contacting Google, I was told that the issue is on fossils end and requested I return the item through them as damaged, but Fossil suggests I return through the original purchase point which at this point is too late.Luckily Amazon was willing to help me out of this situation. After getting months of no help from fossil.The battery life was great, the top button broke within a week but was still functional, watch looked great but the absolute lack of support or help from their team is amazing.Stay away from this scam.",
            "An awesome watch smartwatch with all the needed features..I gave it a four star because the calling feature is buggy",
            "Update-9 hrs daily usage with music controls,phone calls accept command (no voice call on watch) the battery last for 2-3 days. I must acknowledge the OS was updated to help the battery performance.Update after Day 1 review-The product was delivered on time.The watch is a good light weight piece and after using for a day  I can clearly say the they should have worked on battery life. It drains faster even on their 'extended' mode.Will update this review after a month usage on overall performance.",
            "This was my first smart watch and I was uncertain if I would find it easy to figure out but it was very easy to set up and sync with my Android phone. There are numerous watch faces available and I found one that is large and enables me not needing my reading glasses to see the time (still need them sometimes for other functions but that speaks more to my 60+ eyes and is no reflection on the watch). I have been using it to track my gym workouts. I like to mix in a mixture of strength training with different types of cardio and the workout function on the watch provides a long list of possible activities to track. So far I am happy with the look and functionality of the watch but a little disappointed with the battery life. Unless I leave it on extended setting, which doesn't provide the time without depressing the centre button, it barely makes it through the day without needing a charge.",
            "What a beautifully designed watch! I had to force myself to return this due to ONE single flaw: Wear OS! After Tizen with 2 days battery life, this one is simply horrible. I tried every trick in the book and every suggestion and even reset the device twice since I didn't want to return it. Alas! It lasted 4-5 hours before turning off many features. Absolutely pathetic OS. So, sorry for Fossil with such great design and features but the OS just became its Achilles heel. If you are patient, there's an update (Wear OS 3) promised for end of 2022 but it's anyone's guess if that would even satisfactorily address this battery issue. Moved on to the impeccable and gorgeous Withings and never looked back. I hope Fossil redeems itself with the new OS. 5 stars for Fossil and zero for Wear OS.",
            "Good smartwatch, has all the advance smartwatch functions. For those who feel that the battery is poor( yes it is), the watch is supposed to be phone itself(samsung galaxy watch may be letter)!!!. You can place calls(inbuilt speakers and microphone).Navigate on google maps. Book an uber(buggy app as of now)! I easily got a day out of it with it being connected to my phone using Bluetooth for about 90 percent of the time and notifications allowed for most critical apps, and working out with only the watch GPS for about an hour. Always On and Tilt to On was off. The watch is responsive enough without it to show the time immediately when you tap the screen. Heart Rate monitor works fairly well. Just that it's super sensitive.. Pedometer is good as well. The 1 GB RAM Gen 5 models cost about Rs.20000 rupees with offers(ICICI bank 10% + 1000 Amazon pay cashback). All phone notifications come to the watch. It has great power saving mode and last for more days. All in all, a good smartwatch. It's been two days now. Will update this review of anything changes ( YES poor battery life..returning it :P ).",
            "The configuration is easy and the apps are good.Thin and easy to charge, it works well and the buttons are easy to work.It misses a good user manual to configure buttons and some default apps.The cons : the battery with apps is at least 24h, less if some options like heartbeat counter is activated, even the cellphone gets the battery down",
            "It was tv the product per say that I didn't like, it was the condition the item was in when I received it. It's was like it was used,when it should've been brand new. It had 3 scratches on it and fingerprints on it. The seal was broken on the lid and most watches come w a protective film on the watchface. This watch did not. Very disappointed.",
            "First the battery life is barely passable. Also, the watch is very thick, but for some people it's a plus. I give it a bad review because the connectivity with the phone is bad! It connects with my Pixel 4a, but constantly crashes and I can't get calls on the watch. Every app I tried to launch on the watch it said to open it on the phone. It's litteraly unusable. I'm considering sending it back.",
            "Al principio batalle con la conexi\u00f3n del reloj a mi iphone simplemente no se conectaba. Tuve que resetear el reloj como de fabrica cuando ya lo hab\u00eda configurado todo. A partir de esto el equipo ya me ha funcionado muy bien y ya esta siempre bien sincronizado pero si tuve que volver a configurarlo todo . Solo por eso 4 estrellas.",
            "Already used for sports, swimming, hicking, take shower, wash the dog, etc.Exceptional communication with my Android phone to receive calls and talk hands-free.Battery charges within 40 minutes and last about 2 days with normal settings. Less when using Google Fit options.DEXCOM G6 has to be installed before you connect the Wear OS app to your Google account. Doing so, you can add all the apps available on your phone, as well as Dexcom G6 app. This is the solution to access all the apps pr\u00e9sent on your phone.Then, connect Wear OS to your Google account.Enjoy!",
            "Good design, battery also last 36 hrs.",
            "The price is right and classy look. The battery life could be longer, but the watch's battery life is typical for this type of product.Very happy with the purchase. The only thing i would redesign is the extruding buttons. When bending your wrist upwards, the extruding buttons get pressed inadvertently. Google Assistant gets activated, but it is a minor nuisance. Overall, very pleased with this watch.",
            "The worst battery in a smartwatch. Battery only lasts for 4 hours if you use custom mode and 5-6 hours on extended mode.Over all ok but not that great when it comes to features.Think twice before you buy because amazon won't accept to return in back and would just watse time till you compete 10 days of time from the date of purchase.The worst customer experience there can be...Highly disappointed and unfortunate.",
            "I wanted to love the Carlyle. It looks fantastic, and the build quality is great. I have nothing but good things to say about the look and feel. Unfortunately the terrific hardware is let down by Wear OS. I had nothing but trouble getting through the initial setup -- helpful tip, when asked during the pairing process if you want to give the watch access to your phone's contacts, be sure to select \"no\" or the setup process will fail. Google Assistant kept crashing, and after hours of Googling, the problem turned out to be that my phone was set to \"English (US)\" while my watch had defaulted to \"English (Canada)\". Even after fixing the crashes, I was never able to get basic functionality like reminders working. Notifications are hit or miss, and many of the Wear OS apps I'd been excited to try had critical problems. Heart rate tracking is inaccurate to the point of being useless, and either I've taken up sleep-jogging or the activity tracking also has some issues. It's a shame because the watch itself is just lovely, but basic functionality that you'd get with a $30 fitness tracker is just broken here. Disappointing to say the least.",
            "The watch is just waste of money and you will only pay for the brand Fossil otherwise it's a waste, it's battery never complete a full day if you use it, you have to have worry each time you wear it that you don't get embarrassed infront of others as your watch has been shut down. They will not provide any charger and you can't put it in any other smartphone chargers ... After purchase you will feel why the hell did I purchase this one. Given a chance even if they give it by only Rs. 5,000 I will not pick this up.",
            "It's an ok watch but there are several flaws. Connectivity is spotty even with an iPhone, bluetooth is bluetooth we should not be having these issues. battery life diminishes quickly and the watch can barely stay alive for a day. It's certainly not worth the money, a better price point for it to be bang for the buck would be $150 less. You can't text on it, and the speaker/mic is quite low in volume. Not the worse $300 I've spent but also not getting my money's worth with the issues I've had.",
            "Very inferior product.  The watch  had the charging  problem from the first day of purchase.  I thought that  adaptor may have some  problem.  Observed  for a week.  But finally  found that problem in the watch. Other than that,  heart rate sensors  are not working properly.  Connectivity  with phone is also having some problem.... In nutshell  its very bad product.",
            "Works really well!! Was not expecting a wsmartwatch to be as \"fluid\" and fast as this. Really happy with! Look is rock solid, and the matte finish of the stock silicone band is really comfy to wear all day long. Charging is fully done within an hour with the original quick charging cable.",
            "Go for it if you have a power source available always with you because this watch needs to be charged twice in a day. If you are using extensively like controlling music via Spotify or using for calls the battery lasts for only 2-3 hours.I kept location, always on display and blue-tooth off and disconnected from mobile (obviously since blue-tooth off) and battery drained 100 to 0% within a day :(I'm worried about how long I can use this",
            "I gave this watch as a gift to my brother. One fine day it just stopped working so I decided to have it checked. I called Amazon but they asked me to reach out directly to Fossil. I went all the way to Fossil\u2019s store at sq1 just to find out that they cant help me with anything. They gave me a phone number to contact \u2018Repairs\u2019 myself. It was shocking to me that the retailer didnt offer to help at all. They asked me to call and ship the product to \u2018Repairs\u2019 myself which costed me another 18 bucks! This has given me no value for money! Im so so disappointed in Fossil. Never buying from them again! Now im waiting for \u2018Repairs\u2019 to tell me whats wrong with the watch!!! Total waste of money!! Not to mention how embarrassed I was in front of my brother!!",
            "Had a creaking voice issue in speaker but now fixed with the software update. You need to keep checking for updates multiple times continuously just like i read on reddit. After the update i have alsmost no complaints at all screen is a bit smaller compared to my moto 2 gen but not a negative. On the plus side the fast charge is the selling point. Its amazingly fast like my one plus dash charge. That makes the slight less battery life acceptable.",
            "Thus is a great smartwatch to have. It has premium looks and the silicon strap is very comfortable. Works well with both casual as well as formals.Now the main points of focus:1. The battery stays for around a day or so if the watch is use continuously at full functionality. Connecting blutooth andbwifi simultaneously may lead to faster drainage of the battery.2. Takes about an hour to charge from 0 to full.3. The excercise mode is great and tracks the movements well.4. The alarm and vibration are sufficient, not too high but just right and noticable.Tracks your daily activities well. Also you get a good amount of pre-installed watch faces which look quite premium.The battery life isn't equivalent to a few other smartbands but it compensates well with faster recharge and other functionalities. Connects well with Android. A good watch to have in your collection.",
            "Bought it with very high hopes, and doesn't disappoint, until you are well a few hours into it.First, the OS is very well built, clean, and light, takes a bit of a learning curve but is actually pretty decent once you get used to it, and it does lag a bit when you are downloading firmware and software updates but that's almost about it.Secondly, the design is minimalistic but very very charming, there is a \"new toy\" charm when you first buy it,  but considering how quick I lose interest in things, it was very surprising that I kept finding reasons to just look at it, not fiddle, not play, just look, the display is crisp and vibrant and it took me a while to actually register that the call that I've connected to is on my watch speaker and not the phone speaker, so kudos to that on the hardware front, that along with swim resistance makes you feel a lot like your hand is in a good watch.Third, the watch faces are not limited by any means, I've yet to find fully customizeable watch face with my very own choice of wallpapers, but that's about the limit of what isn't there, or quite possibly what I haven't found yet, even so, the watch faces available are customizable to some extent which keeps things from getting monotonous.Fourth, and this one is important, at first it'll feel like there is a bit of a connectivity issue with the wifi and the bluetooth, there isn't, once on your home wifi, turn the bluetooth off on the watch and the primary connection goes to wifi and you can keep using the watch as you were, helps save battery, god knows you'll need to do quite a bit for that. If you turn bluetooth and wifi on at the same time, primary connection remains at bluetooth and as soon as you leave the wifi setting, it'll disconnect from it, don't worry if that happens, there is nothing wrong with your smartwatch.Lastly, and the only sort of a bummer here. It burns through battery at any mode which isn't aimed specifically at power saving, even on the \"extended\" mode, I lost about 15% charge in under an hour, with little to no usage, it helps that it charges at a decent pace, not too slow, not too quick, but it does make you feel sometimes like it should have been quicker.Considering how wide a brand Fossil is, it's one of the safest bet to buy in the budget of around 20K as you can take it to any fossil brand store, and there are plenty around the country, should you face any factory problems, which is very unlikely to begin with, around 5-6 people in my peer group have been using fossil smartwatches from the gen 3 to now gen 5, and no complaints that you wouldn't have gotten with regular wear of a smartwatch of any other brand to begin with.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0After update, cannot contact with internet first, and after update so many 3rd party app installed automatically and i can't un-install them. And after few minutes nothing works. As i also upload video so that everyone can check. Only chinese language app work automatically even i can not use homescreen or any other features of watch.",
            "The Fossil Gen 5 comes with more things than expected. Though Wear OS is a particularly mediocre one when compared to others, but it does the deal here for much less. I promise not to go technical here !Pros :1. Good storage.2. Better battery, lasts for 16 hours perfectly for daily use and probably more for extended mode. I prefer the Custom settings mostly to keep important stuff on my clock.3. Touch screen is very much smooth and easy.4. The buttons are robust to ensure quality and premium performance.5. The fitness apps work accurately.6. Notifications are not more clear, the text looks better and emojis are supported.Cons:1. Slightly heavy but could be made light if you use leather or silicon strap.2. Calling quality is just OKAY. Not that great and could be inproved.3. Major battery drainer is the \"always awake\" mode. So one needs to switch it off.4. Heart Ratw monitor must be set to 3 hours to ensure 16 hours usage time. Else, again the battery would drain.Hope this helps \u2764\ufe0f",

Estoy esperando que Fossil haga valida mi garantia.",
            "The watch is ok overall.There are some problems sometimes like the wifi not picking up when it needed even though its always been enabled, that Google Fit is sometimes not synchronized at certain places or takes sometimes tens minutes to do so, and that when you try to answer calls, its often answers and just tranfers your call back to your phone. I don't know if these are problems with Wear OS or only on that watch, but these problems and a few more can make the experience quite a bit painful sometimes.Now, an aspect that most reviews talk about, the battery. Unless you turn on the battery saving mode or disable some features that are enable by default and that shouldn't drain that much battery, the battery most likely won't last the entire day, and even less if do workout tracking with it. That is one of the worse aspect of the watch since a smart watch is made to follow you in your entire day and help you with all you want during that day, not to have some wanted features turned off to have enough battery or have it turned of or charging a part of the day. At that price point, I expect to have at least a decent battery that lasts the entire day.Otherwise, everything goes pretty well with that watch as long as it's not part of the few problems of the software that the watch has. It is equiped with decent technology (excluding the battery) and is pretty fluid. It also does mostly what you would expect from a smart watch.In conclusion, the watch is pretty much well equiped and is fast, but the few bugs there are and the bad battery life just makes this watch not worth it. It's battery life and the few other problems are just pretty basic things that should definitely not have it's place on a smart watch that is at that price point. I wouldn't recommend this watch to people who asks me about it. At the end, it's your decision, but you should think about it before buying.",
            "The biggest drawback is the limitation in features. Right now, the price is \u20b922,995 but features are not at all enough for that price. It has NFC but useless as Google has not added Google Pay yet in Wear OS in India. It's kind of illogical that we use Google Pay on our phones in India but Google thinks Google Pay in smartwatch is not needed yet by Indians. If you are even thinking to buy this... JUST STOP... I am a fan of Fossil watches but this smartwatch let me down. Just compare it with Samsung Galaxy Active 2 smartwatch. Almost the same price but way more loaded with features even in Galaxy watch App.Wear OS application doesn't have anything in them.Battery life was a huge disappointment for me in this watch. Even with smart battery modes, you can't even think of using your watch without charging for complete 2 days.Many a times I also faced pairing issues with this watch. I noticed many times I am getting a call on my phone but watch is not notifying me.To conclude I would just say don't waste your money and time on this, istead if you have this budget, go for galaxy watches which offer much more in this price range.All the best!",
            "So I'll jump straight into the pros and cons which I felt after using the for one weekPros:  1. Display and Touch Response : The display looks  and feels great. Only in direct sunlight the  visibility gets bit of compromised even with  sunlight booster enabled. Touch response is  also very nice but you have to be precise about  your touch as you are not dealing with a  smartphone screen :P  2. Features: Google's Wear OS brings in alot of  nice features to this product like google fit,  meditation exercises etc. Plus it is easy to  configure this device by using your phone with  the help of Wear OS app. 3. Battery Life: the previous Fossil smartwatches  had lots of issue with the battery life and I  guess Fossil has finally been able to solve it.  The watch runs for almost 2 days straight after  getting fully charged( Daily normal usage). 4. Build Quality: ok you are spending more than  20k for a watch so it is absolutely a necessity for  the watch to look and feel premium. And it  does. The build quality is supernice with metalic  circular dial, sharp clear screen and also the  rubber strap is feels great( I was sceptical about  the rubber strap as I am a fan of leather ones  but trust me it is of super quality, when you touch  it you can literally feel how good the rubber quality is.Now coming to the CONs1. Connectivity: The bluetooth connectivity is good  but faced some issue with the Wi-Fi. Takes a bit  of time to connect to the wifi and flactuates  very often( Gets disconnected).2. Google Assistant not responding: Faced this  issue quite a lot. Out of 10 times only twice or  thrice get the response from GA but maximum  of times it showed some error like Assistant is  not responding, there were some issues  connecting you etc.3. Battery Life: You might think I have put the  battery life in pros then why I am putting it on  Cons again. The reason is with comparison to  previous edition Fossil smartwatches this watch  has much better battery life but in this price  range most of it's competitors are having  greater battery life. So this is down point for this  product.4.Bad Speaker: The most irritating thing of this  watch is the speaker quality. It almost sounds  terrible. No clarity whatsover and the volume is  low too. An area to improve for later generation  Fossil smartwatches.All in all a decent product to have but what I would suggest is to go through different products as well like apple, samsung etc because it is better to search and find a product ehich best suits you when you are paying a hefty amount.",
            "Worst Product I have ever bought in amazon.Look wise fossil lives up to its standard. 5 star for it.Other than that there is no positive in this product.Battery drain in 3 Hrs in Daily use mode.Quality of the charger is pathetic.Sound clarity on the speaker is horrible.Fossil should stop manufacturing this product, rather than spoiling its name & brand image.",
            "Very bad product. Not worthy at allI bought this product on 6th of september 2020 and it got to be a defective piece and though after a period of 3 months on 12th of december i had to give this to the fossil service centre it has been 68 days since than i havent received my watch back repaired.The issues with my watch were the middle pusher button wasnt working and the speakers were giving very bad noises.I will like to give feedback that never purchase a fossil smartwatch",
            "Battery was 100% at 6:30 AM when I awoke. By noon it was at 27%. It\u2019s a shame because Wear OS is excellent, just not on this watch. I had the watch running on the bare minimum of functions, still the battery was draining quickly. What is the use of having a smart watch when you are not able to use all the functions due to the absolutely terrible battery. Please don\u2019t waste your money on this watch.",
            "Had to return the watch after the screen broke for no apparent reason (I am very careful with my technology. I did not do anything with it that should have damaged the screen). The battery life was also complete garbage for a watch that costs this much money. Didn't even last half a day. I'd have to bring my charger with me and charge it about an hour after lunch to be able to get through the day without it dying. I'm now on the TicWatch Pro 3. Much better battery life and overall value for money. Only good thing this watch has that the TicWatch doesn't is mechanical scroll.TL;DR Don't buy this.",
            "The middle button on the right of the watch, which is the most important, fell off in 2 months with moderate usage.Poor quality, without that button I cannot even use my watch now, and finding fossils repair shops is even more painful.Not at all worth. Cannot rely on the durability.",
            "I got this over and Apple Watch mainly because it\u2019s a lot nicer than the ugly square that apple has. I was sceptical at first because there weren\u2019t many reviews on how well it works with an iPhone. For my uses so far it has been fantastic. They\u2019re a obviously some features that an Apple Watch has that this doesn\u2019t but the price is just too damn high. For anyone contemplating getting this over an Apple Watch I highly suggest it. Can\u2019t beat the price",

This has been a quality control issue with previous years' Fossil smartwatches, and it seems Fossil isn't interested in changing their design to ensure they're selling a reliable product. Because I purchased the device through Amazon, I had to ship it to Fossil at my own expense despite visiting a retail location with proof of purchase. It arrived to their repair center 2 weeks ago and I haven't been contacted despite reaching out to them a week ago. Don't waste your time or money.",

So it can't last more than an hour for sure. The only feature compared to fossil sport is speaker and microphone. But sport keeps long lasting charge. Processor is great to use.

Me anim\u00e9 por la actualizaci\u00f3n para las llamadas, por los an\u00e1lisis de sue\u00f1o que ahora se iban a incluir en la versi\u00f3n no premium de Fitbit y por la rebaja de m\u00e1s de 4000 pesos. Total, lo compr\u00e9, la primera opini\u00f3n es que es un smart watch bonito; repito sab\u00eda todo.Que muchas de las car\u00e1tulas te cuestan. Cierto.Que mucha gente se quej\u00f3 del bot\u00f3n. No me import\u00f3, y es muy cierto que tienes que desactivar la funci\u00f3n de dejarlo apretado, de otra forma vas a iniciar lo que programaste porque se inicia a cada rato cuando presionas la mu\u00f1eca..Que no se puede guardar m\u00fasica y que se requiere una cuenta premium de Spotify para que sirva. Cierto.Que su sistema operativo no es tan \u00e1gil como otros. Muy cierto.No me import\u00f3 nada.Hasta que un d\u00eda me levanto con la noticia que hab\u00eda recorrido mil pasos durante la noche, pens\u00e9 que hab\u00eda sido una falla del sistema, hasta que empez\u00f3 a pasar todas las noches.Empiezo la investigaci\u00f3n, encuentro que m\u00e1s gente reporta lo mismo, que no hay una forma de borrar los pasos y la quema de calor\u00edas ficticia, ah, y que probablemente suceder\u00eda lo mismo mientras manejo.A ver, un reloj que te cuesta 9000 pesos, ni siquiera puede hacer esto bien. Tienen una aplicaci\u00f3n frustrante, de verdad, y nunca pude hacer funcionar el asistente de google.Total, si buscas un reloj \u00abdiferente\u00bb que se vea bien, pero con el que batalles para las cosas m\u00e1s esenciales, no busques m\u00e1s.

Paso a enumerar todos los problemas que he tenido:1. El bot\u00f3n h\u00e1ptico a veces no funciona.2. A veces no recibes las notificaciones y si las recibes correctamente se van almacenando, pero llega un momento en el que se borran y ya no puedes responder ning\u00fan mensaje.3. Solo puedes responder a los mensajes, pero no puedes enviar ning\u00fan mensaje sin que previamente no te hayan enviado uno.4. Hay momentos en los que falla buscar el m\u00f3vil, y cuando lo busca y suena el tel\u00e9fono, permanece apagado, por lo que a veces tienes el m\u00f3vil delante y aunque suene no lo ves. Para que pare de sonar tienes que darle a \"parar\" en la pantalla, no sirve poner la mano para que cese la b\u00fasqueda.5. No puedes acceder a ciertas apps de mensajer\u00eda, solo las prefijadas por fitbit, por lo que es una restricci\u00f3n bastante importante para aquellos que usamos varias aplicaciones de mensajer\u00eda.6. Fitbit te dice que puedes responder llamadas con este smartwatch, pero no es as\u00ed, solo puedes descolgar, pero no puedes usar el micr\u00f3fono del smartwatch para hablar, lo que hace esta caracter\u00edstica es ponerte el m\u00f3vil en funci\u00f3n manos libres, que si lo tienes guardado en alg\u00fan lugar cerrado, tampoco te escuchar\u00e1n.7. Alexa es muy restrictiva en este dispositivo, no puedes enviar un mensaje o llamar, solo sirve para hacerle preguntas del tiempo o qui\u00e9n es el presidente del gobierno.8. Muchas aplicaciones est\u00e1n en ingl\u00e9s, como la meditaci\u00f3n guiada, que no es que no me defienda con el ingl\u00e9s, pero fitbit deber\u00eda haberse tomado cierto inter\u00e9s con los idiomas.9.

            "Fitibit sense dovrebbe fare un sacco di cose, promesse nella pubblicit\u00e0 e nelle caratteristiche riportate, ma....non le fa.E' uno sport watch, assolutamente non smart. Infatti, acquistandolo a prezzo pieno, si ottiene un orologio ricco di aspettative che nel pratico, non sono eseguibili. Prima fra tutte, l'ecg non ancora abilitato. Poi abbiamo google non ancora presente. La messaggistica \u00e8 pessima, dato che non appena si riceve una notifica, questa sparisce appena la leggiamo senza restare in archivio. Non c'\u00e8 ancora modo di immagazzinare musica per ascoltare solo con smartwatch, ma si deve utilizzare spotify oppure un altro programma a pagamento.Il gps con me non ha mai funzionato.C'\u00e8 un parco app che non \u00e8 ancora disponibile, e non capisco come abbiano potuto mettere il prodotto sul mercato se ancora non \u00e8 attivo in tutte le sue sfacettature.Una cosa che mi ha motlo infastidito sono i grafici della app, incompresibili. Ossigenazione e temperatura si calcolano solo di notte e non si riesce  aleggerne i valori reali, ma solo percentuali assolutamente ignote.I passi sono soprastimati, poich\u00e8 in mezza giornata raggiungi diecimila passi anche stando fermo e muovendo solo le braccia.Le attivit\u00e0 sportive bloccano qualsiasi utilizzo dell'orologio, perci\u00f2 non si pu\u00f2 nemmeno uscire dalla schermata per cambiar musica o fare altro.Ci sono troppe cose che ancora non vanno e per il prezzo, direi che non ne vale ancora la pena. Bocciatissimo.",
            "It took me 2 weeks to decide whether to buy the Sense or not. I read uncountable reviews and was very hesitant. Since I own a smartwatch but wanted a really good health tracker in addition I thought I just chance it and try the Sense 4 weeks ago,At first I had problems setting it up. It just wouldn't connect to my phone. I tried for hrs and googled. After midnight I found out that I cannot have 2 watches paired with my phone. So there was nothing wrong wit the Fitbit Sense, I just had to unpair the other watch, I then reset the Sense (long press and hold of the button/indent for more than 10 secs) and voila, it worked a treat. In the meantime I had already started return of the item and printed all documents ;-)After 4 weeks I have now cancelled the return because I am 100% happy with my purchase.If you are a serious runner, you wouldn't go for a Fitbit anyway,right? You might go for Garmin or Polar. The Sense is ideal for those you want to track steps, sleep, HR, ECG and so much more. The SpO2 will only be measured during the night so you can see the value next morning. This is important for me because I have slight sleep apnoea and I like to know if it goes below 90%.Yes, in order to see the SpO2 you need to choose a certain watch face, I don't see a problem with that. If you need SpO2 monitoring all day you can buy an SpO2 metre to clip on the index finger.When you use this special watch face you can tap on the screen and it switches from SpO2 to  HR, another tap to steps, next tap to active mins, another tap to floors ( the only one I switched off. I don't use it )I have no problems with the indent /button at the side. It is just a matter of getting used to it. I have NEVER experienced that by bending my hand I accidentally would have hit the button. That never happened.The HR is very accurate, I compared it with the HR my Samsung watch showed at the same time(not connected to phone)The sensors have been very reliable .Some complain about lagging. I have no problems with that. It is a new watch with new sensors , there will be updates soon and I am positive that this point will be addressed. I do believe it depends on the phone the Sense is connected to and the firmware version of the watch. I had an update 2 days after set up and my watch works perfectly fine.Battery life is amazing. with 3 x 30min jogs with GPS every week and many notifications from several apps and even accepting phone calls my Sense last about 4 1/2 days. The charging speed is outstanding, it'll blow you away. 10 mins from 4% to 25% keeps me going all day if I forget to charge in time. I don't have to charge over night and miss out on sleep tracking. I charge when I'm watching telli. The charger is a strong magnetic one that attaches easily to the watch and doesn't fall off.The wristband is like most others : the silicone-sweaty-sort-of-thing. This is one thing I don't like but I found an elastic fabric one on Amazon.com and I just love it. I am hyper sensitive to all rubber/silicone so the elastic one is brilliant for me.What I also don't like is that to some of the features in the app you have only access to with Fitbit subsciption. This is included in the purchase for 6 months. I will not renew it and will be happy to read the stats, after 6 months I'm sure I know what they tell me.So as you can see , I am happy with the Sense and am confident that with future updates it will be even more exiting. We should be a bit patient, everything new can have hickups. I only encountered one: after changing the watch face, suddenly there were no data on my watch screen, it showed the symbol for steps but no figure, yet in the app all steps were shown. A simple reset of the watch (press button for more than 10 secs, hold and wait for Fitbit sign to appear) solved the problem.At last: I live in Ireland and my Sense already has the ECG feature which works a treat. Some countries will get this feature with a next update, as I understand.",
            "E' il quarto fitbit che acquisto , ma il sense e' veramente una delusione.Non c'e'l'ecg promesso, la misurazione della temperatura corporea non esiste , c'e' una misurazione della variazione della temperatura cutanea notturna che non serve a nulla se non si conosce la temperatura puntuale, la saturazione non funziona, il gps si aggancia dopo tre minuti quindi i report degli allenamenti sono sballati, la batteria non dura pi\u00f9 di tre giorni e non sei giorni come promesso, infine ci sono difficolta' ad accendere alla schermata home, occorre scuoterlo pi\u00f9' volte. Il cinturino e'pessimo : ho lo stigmate sul braccio. Non vale 329 euro. Se non fanno gli aggiornamenti entro il16 ottobre lo restituisco ad Amazon. Sconsigliato!",
            "Ok so i have been a active user of Fitbit for many many years and this is myost favourite device yet! The battery life is very good and I think I maybe getting 3 to 4 days (can't be 100%) as one of the apps on the watch was in use without me knowing due to a short cut I created!\ud83d\ude02 Changed now. The mobile app has NOT changed but has new additional information because of the additional info the Sense can collect. The accuracy seems the same as my versa except I seem to be sleeping better! Overall it's clean with a beautiful screen and doesn't appear any heavier on my wrist than my versa. The onboard gps is a great addition but don't add the walking exercise to the shortcuts as it will pick you up running round the house! A few tiny glitches but these will get sorted over time. There is no onboard music storage who h is a complete disappointment as I used to load up my versa and use it in the gym leavingyibile iny locker. But again, my most favourite Fitbit device yet.",
            "So I got this delivered on lauch day (25th September) and have worn it every day and night since.I have had many fitbit trackers in the past and the last one was the Ionic. I gave up on the Ionic after a year because I had so many issues with it, the worst being it would loose connection with my phone for no reason and then I had to unpair, delete and re install time and time again.I have been using the Samsung galaxy watch active 2 since and it was an excellent smartwatch but its fitness tracking was not good mostly because of the calories burned during exercise which was so off.I was excited to see the Sense on the fitbit website before it launched and I decided to treat myself. I always buy from Amazon because their customer service and aftercare is excellent.Putting it simply I love this watch. It looks great, feels premium and the screen is bright and clear. I'm fully used to the haptic button and prefer it to an actual button as it means that the watch will be better protected from water.My only problem is that when doing strenuous exercise like spinning the heart rate sensor takes a while to register the high heart rate reached, sometimes my heart rate slows a bit before the watch catches up which meand I miss out on the top range readings of my heart rate. Also the watch seems to think my heart rate drops down into the 110 to 120 bpm after an intense interval but my heart rate is definitely still really high in between hard efforts so this does bother me.  My Ionic did this when I first got it but it seemed to improve over time so I'm hoping that the Sense does too. My guess is that it is something software related which can be fixed. Also when weight training the watch puts my heart rate at 110 to 120 bpm when I know that after doing squats for 6 solid minutes with a weights bar my heart rate is way higher, my Samsung puts my heart rate at 140 to 150 bpm for this. Walking seems accurate as does martial arts and kick boxing. Maybe fitbit could fix this with an update.All of the features of this watch are great and I love it. I'm looking forward to seeing what updates come in the future to improve things. I'm especially looking forward to being able to answer phone calls on the watch as this was a big feature I enjoyed with my Samsung. The new os is nice and the connection to the phone is way more stable but it did drop out once so far and I had to unpair, delete and re install then it worked. I think that fitbit might be working on stability now as it needs to be better to be able to take calls on the watch so I'm guessing that's why we don't have that function yet.All in all I'm happy despite the niggles. I find this watch exciting.Update!My sense had to be sent back to fitbit today as it was faulty.  I'm very happy with fitbit customer service so far as they are replacing my sense with very little effort to action this.Unfortunately though Amazon now don't replace faulty products after the 1st 30 days. They used to replace faulty products up to a year after purchase which is why I bought it from them. I will just buy from the manufacturer in the future now. I have to say the Amazon customer service lady was excellent,  not her fault that the procedure has changed. Just thought this might be an important point to make incase anyone else buys from Amazon because of the returns policy which has now changed.",
            "This is my review of the Fitbit sense after wearing for 2 monthsPros: -battery lasts a long time and is quicker to charge than other models, the actual charger is much better as it works as a magnet to the device rather than the clip style Fitbit are most known to have- updated HR sensors, the ones on my old fitbits were very temperamental especially during sweaty workouts they would just cut off entirely at points, this watch does not have this issue, versa 3 also has the updated sensors.-looks very sleek compared with other models, other than it being a fitness tracker aesthetically speaking it is a nice watch.-fitness bands are much, much easier to switch between compared to other Fitbit models that use a pin type mechanism- screen display is clear, easy to read, options for always on mode so you don't have to manually turn on the display to view the time or your steps etc. The display feels a lot less clunky when swiping through your stats in comparison to previous watch models.-mobile app is useful and one of the reasons I'm loyal to the brand as it's very user friendly.-6months free premium in app subscription with purchase-google assistant and Amazon Alexa compatible-ability to take calls and read notifications and texts as they appear on your phone-sleep tracking much like on other models is useful and helps me aim to get more sleep each night, the daily sleep score is also a good indicator for improvementCons: - the price and the features you get Vs the versa 3 probably isn't worth an extra \u00a3100 in my opinion.-ECG feature seems quite gimmicky and I have only used it a couple times-stress sensoring features are not accurate in my opinion, I've had panic attacks wearing this watch and it has never alerted me of a raised hr as it's supposed to and my stress score has been good regardless of this so I would say this is either very buggy or just novelty.- just like all other official Fitbit straps I've experienced, I got a really bad rash. I highly recommend the adepoy third party brand of straps if you have this issue, steer clear of cavn (which was the most widely advertised straps when I initially went searching for a replacement) as they are made terribly and will snap inside your watch which is more than slightly alarmingOverall I am happy with my purchase but there is room for improvement and I definitely feel like the versa 3 would be just as good if you're not into the ECG features.",
            "Received in early evening. By bedtime I had reactivated my old fitbit account and paired the Sense with my phone. Wore both my old tracker and Sense overnight to compare sleep tracking. By the morning I could not sync my phone and Sense, pairing had gone. Tried to set it up again, didn't work. Followed the on line help, no joy. After 2 long calls to fitbit support during which bluetooth was off and on, the sense was off and on, a factory reset for the sense, fitbit app uninstalled and reinstalled no success. Also installed fitbit app on a tablet and the same happened. Pairing disappeared and could not get it to work again. During this time I was asked to use the Sense button several times, it worked about 1 in 5 times. This should not happen with a \u00a3250 smartwatch so it was returned. Thanks to Amazon for their prompt service.",
            "Looks and comfort great. Usability not so good! Once connected to phone, it diverts the notifications etc to watch,WHICH HAS NO NOTIFICATION SOUNDS. It was supposed to handle phone calls and have ECG capability,  but neither work. Its gestures and touch response were very poor and intermittent. I SENT IT BACK!!",
            "I bought this as my first Fitbit was an Inspire 2, but the strap caused severe irritation and wasn't as fancy, it wasn't something I could proudly wear while on my weightloss journey. The strap in the Sense is the latest and most premium strap I've ever used, it uses a different mechanism of attaching to the wrist and is much softer.Regarding the watch, for the first day I found it not to be tracking my heart rate that much, I'm not sure if it was simply postional error on my wrist or that the watch needed to get used to being on my arm as I have tattoos. It now tracks my heartrate all the time, although some nights I've found it has said it didn't get a consistent read and therefore never gave the more accurate sleep reading which tells you amount of REM sleep amongst other factors.I find the watch is more accurate in measuring my steps, perhaps due to GPS, and additionally it tracks floor climbed which the Inspire 2 does not. It's much easier to track and start exerc than the Inspire and the Versa is probably similar, so if you don't need EDA or heart rhythm than it may be a better purchase. I decided to get the most premium watch Fitbit produced as I prefer the Fitbit app in terms of tracking moreso than the Samsung watch I've used before. It is very useful and the premium is worth it in my opinion.Battery life for me is 4 days with dim screen brightness and not being always on, and with using the sleep mode at night which stops the screen turning on as you move in bed. Overrall I highly recommend the watch, but if you don't need some features I'd say the Versa is good enough.Edit: Small movements like moving up a flight of stairs or slightly moving in bed cause the watch to not read my heart rate until I remove it and put it back on, therefore leading to inconsistent sleep data and a lot of hassle. For \u00a3300 this is incredibly inconvenient, therefore like a lot of reviewers I returned this watch. If it worked I would've kept it, and if it does work for you, keep it.",
            "At first I was really pleased with my fit bit. It looks smart and it takes lots of measurements. However within a few weeks the flexible watch band came loose and the watch dropped off my wrist and landed on the floor face down.  The screen has smashed and cracked across. For a sports product I would have thought they would have made it more durable than this. Be warned there is no way of getting the screen repaired once it breaks unlike a phone or Apple watch. So you will have \u00a3300 of useless plastic. I am actually still paying for mine too. Also to say I got eczema from the band in my wrist which must contain latex or similar and really flared up my allergies. As a final point many of the good features such as ECG you have to pay a subscription for after a few months. Won't bother with a Fitbit again!",
            "Having had and used a Fitbit since the start, my last Fitbit Versa needed an upgrade....I reviewed many other smart watches from all makes, but, finally to stick with Fitbit and purchased the Fitbit Sense.....Big mistake...PROSLovely strap and fixes into place far more easier than any other Fitbit I had previouslyBigger screen and much clearer to readI liked the push to get it going...despite some reviews, I had no problems operating itGreat Apps and I loved the 6month free premium albeit draining of battery if had all onSO..... apart from that I have nothing else to recommend THE Fitbit SenseCONSBattery life shockingly very short...longer if you took off all the apps that monitor your exercise health and fitnessConstantly not synching, apps not workingAND FOR me the worst thing about it was, it was not registering the correct steps/miles ECT from my runs on Treadmill and/exercisesI did sought advice from Fitbit help/community forum, to no avail, I felt I was fobbed off regarding the accuracy of mile sand/steps ran was down to GPS....sorry, but I did not have any of these problems with my Versa, which i have had for 3yrs....It was after several times uninstalling and reinstalling the Sense and still not working as advertised that I reluctantly had to send back.At \u00a3245, I expected the Sense to be working as advertised and yes I know they did do an operating upgrade to sort out glitches, it was obviously not enough.I for one am very very disappointed in the Fitbit Sense because if it was working as well as advertised, I could have enjoyed using it as my upgrade fitness smart watch.I have now gone back to my trusty old Versa where, at least, my miles and steps are in synch along with everything else",
            "Bit of history I've had fitbits for years now.. they've survived through, house renovations.. Crossfit and well even me getting run over!  Got the sense back in May, had it only 2 months and accidentally dropped it.... not from great height on to my kitchen floor the screen smashed.  Which amazed me because all my old ones (the last being the Versa 2) have been so robust.... I thought no worries I'm clumsy I'll get a screen... much to my despair they don't do replacement screens!!!!  a \u00a3300 watch and you can't repair it! I'm devastated.  It worked for about a week after but now wont even charge.The actual watch was good and I want another but I'm really worried it won't last me. Some of the apps aren't great but it's improving all the time.  I'll agree with a lot of the reviews about the strap... I have sensitive skin and had to replace it within a week.So I'm currently debating if to buy another and get a screen protector... (ironically I had one in the draw but thought it made the watch look ugly/bulky.. and all my others didn't need it so went without) or continue with my Versa 2.  I'm missing the GPS and the in-depth sleep functions etc. but just can't bring myself to shell out another \u00a3300 ... well \u00a3279 as they are at the moment.I even contacted Fitbit and I have to say they weren't overly hopeful at all and didn't really get that I was upset I couldn't get spares not the fact I couldn't claim on the warranty.. I knew that from the start I dropped it!",
            "This Sense would have been my 5th Fitbit watch however changing to the longer strap I noticed one of the easy release tabs was extremely stiff and I broke a nail on it. Eventually I was able to release the short strap and replace it with the longer one. Within FOUR days the easy release catch would not hold the strap and it fell off onto the couch. No fiddling would get it to hold the strap fitting.I am extremely disappointed with Amazon's customer service as they tried to fob me off to Fitbit rather than meet their legal requirements under Consumer legislation. They refused me a replacement and best I could achieve was a full refund.As a secondary example of amazon's terrible service to customers is the two additional straps I've ordered for the Sense are no longer required as amazon refused to replace the Fitbit, their solution is to demand over 50% of the purschase price of the straps to return them, the second one I have even received yet.Defintiely avoid this Fitbit Sense and purchase from amazon.I doubt they will publish this review because it is so damning of both Fitbit and Amazon!",
            "Had a few of these, first one would not connect (Ebay)., second had a faulty pixel (Amazon), so as headline, third time lucky.Bought for wife so she is really impressed, especially with Amazon doing the replacements / refunds. Me not so happy. Top class company, but an iffy product. Has it been released too early? Time will tell.happy to recommend, but maybe we have just been unlucky. ..... Time will tell.",
            "Charged and set up but thought it looked odd. It took me a while to work out what was wrong with it. The display is crooked. Writing higher on the left than the right. Once you see it you can't unsee it. This is going back. Hugely disappointed because I wanted to love this fitbit. Googled and found others with the same issue. I expected better for the money.",
            "I ummed and arred for a long time before buying this watch. In the end I decided that I didn't want a smart watch, I wanted a decent fitness watch that would give me all the stats I need to track my general health and fitness. And that's exactly what I got.The fitbit app is easily the best app I've used, it links with myfitnesspal to give me a real time calories in vs calories out (CICO) and the free trial of premium means I also have easily digestable articles and recipes to support my weight loss.I love that there are so many faces to choose from and you can design your own in a separate app. The EDA stress tracker with guided meditation is also excellent if you can take 2 minutes a day for some mindful breathing and meditation.Is it worth the extra \u00a3100 over the Versa 3? I'm still not sure. After a month I think I've used the ecg maybe 3 times and the skin temperature is useful only because I have a neurological condition that's affected by my body temperature and I'm hoping it will give me an early warning before flare ups. If I didn't have that I'd probably have gone for the Versa 3.",
            "Love it. This is my second Fitbit and it has so many more features than the charge 2. Bought for the health monitoring as much as fitness and its great. Very comfortable and the big colour screen is easy to read. Still getting used to navigating my way around it but overall it's great.  The only downside is the battery life is pretty low If using always on display and some other features but otherwise it's really good.",
            "Good looking fitness watch with lots of functions but it's let down by poor software and non existent product support.I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present and initially she had problems getting some of the functions to work and no stress management scores. Fitbit support were useless so we spoke to Amazon who sent a replacement and that is performing even worse, not reading SpO2 levels, sleep tracking or stress management scores.",
            "I find that the heart rate monitor is not accurate at all. More so when working out. I have cleaned the back of the device, restarted it numeroustimes and double checked it with other heart rate monitors. When exercising it can be as much as 50 beats per minute out.After a month of usage I Still find that this watch is a step or ten back from the Ionic. I am forever cleaning, restarting and manoeuvring the watch up and down my wrist. It is never accurate. I sit on my sofa and it reads 107 bpm heart rate. I go on a 9 m bike ride and it reads as 83 bpm.",
            "I regret buying this. Display is very sensitive and is not good for sports or exercise activity. Display cracked in 3 weeks after purchasing the product. The only exercises that I do is zumba and running.My husband and a couple of other friends are facing the same problem. I had versa and then decided to move to sense which I think was a big mistake!Currently it's at the amazon repair center and it's been a few weeks now. Hence I must say its not easy to get the display repaired as well !",
            "Compared with the other models of Fitbit, it is a bit expensive, but comparable with the more expensive smart watches available on the market.Battery life is excellent.  Only needs charging once a week.Bluetooth link sometimes drops on the Fitbit app if the Fitbit is out of range of the phone or tablet, and is easy enough to rectify.",
            "This watch looks and fits great. Best fitting smart watch / band ever.That's where it ends as nothing seems to synch and I can't get messages.The learning curve is way too high so it's being returned. Shame as I really wanted this to be great.",
            "Until I bought Fitbit sense I did not know how much I had REM sleep or deep sleep or movements during sleep. As you can see the photo from my iPhone it gives very good analysis of the sleep. It also provide good analysis of exercise.The battery consumption is also very good with fast charging.The only issue that I discovered to be carful is , that when I used it 24 hours for a long time , it is not good for the skin on the wrist . So when I am working I am taking it off and leave it on charge .",
            "All was going well until the strap in-clipped it-self, the phone fell on the floor and cracked the screen. Unlike Apple, Fitbit don\u2019t offer a screen repair service.",
            "1.) does not sync with IPhone health App2.) heart rate measure does not provide correct readings for sufferers of atrial fibrillation.3.) Fitbit app is ok but nothing special.4.) watch font size very small and not adjustable, not suitable for people with limited vision.5.) reports include men trial cycle for an 85 year old.6.) No option to disable steps for a wheelchair user.",
            "I was very pleased with my new Fitbit Sense as it performed equally as well as my previous Fitbit Verser. However the battery life only lasted for about 4 days not 6 as advertised. I also had a problem with syncing my Sense on a couple of occasions and had to force the Sense to close and restart to get it to sync with my iPhone. The battery does charge up more quickly though.",
            "There\u2019s only one wish I\u2019d like, please can you add a BP monitor to it?Would make my life so much easier as I have to send regular readings to my Health team.Other than that, I love it.Looks good, feels good, and it\u2019s certainly helping me stay motivated.",
            "I ordered this because I wanted to challenge my friend to be active. He ordered a versa 3 and the watch was missing but luckily it got replaced. I ordered the sense because I wanted to track my temperature and have a better watch than him but when I finally got my delivery there was no watch just a charger and a strap in the box. Surely they must weigh or check the boxes at Fitbit??  Something dodgy is going off either with Fitbit or Amazon. I\u2019d advise that you stay well clear and order from somewhere reputable like curry\u2019s where you can actually check the contents. Be warned!!",
            "Brought as a present. And have had a lot of good feedback on what it does and how simple it is to use with the app. Wrist straps are easy to change and the protective screens you can buy in different colours. Would definitely recommend for your loved ones",
            "Bought this for my partner for Christmas just gone and she loves it. It charges fast and tracks her steps, excecise and calories, sleep way better than her old Samsung smart watch. Very happy with this purchase - little pricey (went on sale just after I recover and wrapped the gift which is a shame but still happy)",
            "Very good watch but watch out if you suffer with sensitive skin. I've had to return as had an allergic reaction to the strap. I've been alternating on different wrists and washing the watch when I have a shower. Taking it off to give my skin a break but I still had a nasty flare up!!",
            "I really wish I didn't buy Fitbit sense and just kept on going with the Charge2 I have.I don't think Fitbit Sense is thought through and I suspect the next version might improve.Sense has a lot of data that is of little use but it removed the possibilty of storing music to the smartwatch.So before I had to run with the phone because Fitbit didnt have GPS and now I have to run with it because they removed the possibility of saving music to it.To have full use of it, you have to pay \u00a3300 for the smartwatch and another \u00a3110 a year to see all the data it collects.For me it is a time to find another smartwatch now, I have been with Fitbit for long enough..",
            "Works nicely for most of the things that it tries to do, even if the battery life is a little limited.However, if you use it to track weights sessions the repeated heartrate spikes are smoothed out by the software. So overall, nice but far more flawed that watch should be for this price range.",
            "I love the features of this watch - one of the best on the market in my opinion. Lots of useful health metrics. But unfortunately you need to sleep with it on to get much useful data and it\u2019s so bulky I find that uncomfortable.",
            "I was so excited to receive my fitbit sense. It looks fantastic and is the most comfortable fitness tracker I've ever owned. I have tiny wrists so they often dont fit well. Unfortunatly as other reviews have stated, the Sense just doesnt seem to work properly yet. It sometimes connects to my phone randomly but for the majority of the time it wont, meaning that 80% of its functionality is useless (e.g. taking calls, linking to music etc). You also cant get your stats onto the ap when you want to review them. There are also issues with the charging - it says 'slow charging'everytime I plug it into the wall or USB port. Frustrating as it is a great tracker/ watch if it worked like it is supposed to!",
            "The worst product I never have. I buy this, for my wife like birthday present. After two months the watch battery start keeping a life just for couple hours. Per day need two times recharge. Then after one more month this watch dead. That not take recharge. I contact with fibis costumer service. But they not help.  So better don't buy this product. Not worst even \u00a320",
            "the laptop would not recognize the sense it could see the charge 2 and charge 3 but no sense and there's no sense to that. it is also thick. I wanted it for the SPO2 and blood pressure. I don't use smart phones other than as a phone if I need a computer I use a powerful desktop or laptop.",
            "This is an amazing watch with its capabilities (long lasting battery life, accurate sleep tracking and an compatible mobile app). The only issue I have with this is the strap that is compatible with this watch it\u2019s uncomfortable and pinches your skin. Apart from that, it\u2019s perfect.",
            "Ended up returning it within a couple of weeks as the HRM was totally off. Telling me my heart rate was in the high 90s even at resting rate. Compared it with the fitness watches owned by friends and the heart rate was on avg 20bpm lower! Didn\u2019t find the menu easy to use and thought the subscription needed for the advanced features was a rip off. Looks nice with nice screen but that\u2019s it.",
            "Love it. Does everything I want it too. ECG, stress levels, tracking sleep. But also now can just press play when starting a run instead of starting on my phone app, love the gps element. Really happy. Long battery life. Never miss any calls now as my watch vibrates and you can see who\u2019s calling and read shirt messages.",
            "Problems with calendar notifications and slow charging alerts, apps not displaying, cannot log water. It seems like to software in a beta test rather than fully working.For the money I would expect everything to work properly and this is not the case.",
            "I am a fan of Fitbit and have just bought this having had the versa lite since it came out. Only day 2 of owning the sense, but I am really happy with it.",
            "Battery life is really good. Sleep tracker works well. Like the extras like the ECG checker.",
            "Not impressed at all.I wanted this to track my calories spend and it's doing a pretty good job but using it is painThe screen only wakes up when it feels like it, google assistant turns on whenever I am doing a burpee, the watch restarts itself randomly or the step counter stops working.Calories burned is pretty good but you can't see your calorie burned from activity or set a target for this which is disappointing.",
            "Step count inaccurate, SPO2 inaccurate and not real-time, never detected the large staircase in my house which I use several times a day. ECG feature was nice but not something I would regularly use once novelty factor had worn off.I did not trust the sleep tracking as the SPO2 was so inaccurate.",
            "Soy clienta asidua de Fitbit desde hace casi 7 a\u00f1os, me encanta su plataforma pues es muy amigable. Dentro de los monitores tambi\u00e9n representa uno de los m\u00e1s baratos y con el dise\u00f1o m\u00e1s lindo. Cambi\u00e9 al fitbit Sense, pues mi monitor anterior, el Versa, dej\u00f3 de funcionar. Ese es el \u00fanico tema con el que me he enfrentado con la marca Fitbit; sus devices no me duran m\u00e1s de 2 a\u00f1os, y encuentro que no son tan impermeables como se presume, pues cada que dejan de funcionarme es porque nad\u00e9 con ellos varios d\u00edas (en mar, albercas, cenotes). Me parece que el Sense podr\u00eda ser distinto al no tener botones como tal, sino un tipo de sensor que funciona como lo hac\u00edan \u00e9stos y as\u00ed no hay manera de que se cuele agua en el monitor.Me parece tambi\u00e9n que el soporte t\u00e9cnico es muy bueno, pues como lo cont\u00e9 en las l\u00edneas anteriores, mis devices dejaban de funcionar y fitbit se encargaba de apoyarme e incluso enviarme nuevos monitores. Esto es lo que m\u00e1s me ha convencido de la marca; est\u00e1n comprometidos con el usuario.Dentro de los assets adicionales que Fitbit tiene; hay rutinas de ejercicio que puedes ver desde el monitor o la app del celular; tiene foros de discusi\u00f3n; cuenta con una versi\u00f3n premium para tener acceso a contenidos para cuidar tu salud, m\u00e1s entrenamientos, etc (yo no la he usado)En cuanto a sus funciones; El Sense trae nuevos assets: medici\u00f3n de temperatura en sue\u00f1o, medici\u00f3n del estr\u00e9s, a partir de tocar con la palma entera el monitor durante un minuto. Sesiones de meditaci\u00f3n o respiraci\u00f3n. Rutinas de ejercicio, m\u00e9tricas promedio de todos tus signos vitales; consejos para mejorarlos. erc,La bater\u00eda me est\u00e1 durando un poco m\u00e1s que el sense, siendo que no estoy registrando todos mis entrenamientos, por lo que mi uso es muy pasivo. El monitor carga m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido en su charger.En el caso del sense, me est\u00e1 sucediendo que no es muy exacto con las m\u00e9tricas de temperatura, e incluso sue\u00f1o. Mis entrenamientos no se trackean autom\u00e1ticamente, tengo que activar la funci\u00f3n de manera manual, cuando antes no ten\u00eda que hacerlo en el Versa, el monitor lo identificaba solo. Si lo comparo con monitores como Garmin, me parece que fitbit es mucho m\u00e1s amigable y es para personas como yo, que no somos atletas pero cuidamos mucho nuestro cuerpo y estamos al pendiente de nuestras funciones vitales. En el caso de Samsung, estos son excelentes monitores, pero tienen un precio mayor y te atan a tener un celular de su marca, de Apple ni hablo, porque es una groser\u00eda lo que cuestan y no son tan exactos.Espero les haya ayudado mi rese\u00f1a.",
            "The most amazing watch, worth every penny. I had the versa 2 and upgraded to this one. It\u2019s super accurate and a great help to track my health stats. The sleep tracker it\u2019s great. Stress relief.",
            "I loved my Fitbit Versa and sold it on buying my new Sense.  I hate this watch.  The strap has given my wrist a rash and I can\u2019t buy any other straps for it at the moment.  The side of the watch is slower to respond when you use it for the timer.  The extra features don\u2019t tell you very much.  The screen is slow to respond.  The battery life is much worse.  My versa would go a week without needing charging and this is every couple of days.  I\u2019m gutted I sold my Versa.",
            "Nice balance between fitness tracker and smart watch, good battery life when compared to some other devices and lots of features on the watch and app.",

            "I love it. After trying different cheaper smartwatches,  I wanted one that also measures SO2 and skin temperature. However,  the battery does last max 48 hours and I am allergic to the standard straps/ wristband. Ordered a fabric band hoping to solve the latter issue.",
            "I was very pleased with the improvements on Fitbit I have used it for years to check my steps  and sleep pattern",

            "Great product, does the job I want and provides me with the information I want.",
            "I bought this watch to replace an Amazfit.  The Amazfit is a good watch but I found it a little too clunky.....I have very small wrists.  The Garmin Venu SQ looks a little better as it has a more square shape and I heard that it was a very reliable watch.  It did look better and the Display was much brighter that my Amazfit, and I liked that it had a Sp02 monitor.  However, I was disappointed with this watch.  First of all, the display would just randomly fade in and out and sometimes the swiping action would not work....It took me 3 min one time to change the watch face.  And the watch faces are all made for round faces and look kind of funny on a square watch.  Also the Sp02 monitoring was not accurate....it was constantly giving me low readings.  I think the other measurements were fairly accurate, but I didn't keep the watch long enough to thoroughly test those out.  The other negative thing about this watch is that it was very difficult to navigate its options....not at all intuitive.  I ended up getting the Amazfit GTS 2 mini which is nicer looking, works much better and is so much easier to use, at almost half the price.....there is no comparison.  I am surprised at the Garmin quality for that price point.",

            "The Bad:1, A little plasitky looking.2, LCD Screen not like AMOLED, looks not that good on color and screen resolution is low level in 2020 even in 1999.3, Screes too small as a watch, wasting the body size, also makes very easy to get wrong touch unless you have a girls finger.4, Meanwhile, some letters and numbers are very small, even smaller than smart wristband, you need to open your eyes widely and stared, or go buy a telescope.5, Screen brightness is half-auto, only 3 level choice,6, Even you set to mid brightness, still too dark that hard to read even in a little darker room.7, When you set to high brightness in a normal light room, screen will jump from high to mid and mid to high again and again but you can not turn auto sensor off.6, Always on not that always sometimes, you have to tap it.7, APP store is really a joke, 99.9% APP not fit square screen, and most App just amateur level,  IOS APP way better.8, Charging cable very short, you better buy a very short table for it or you put in on ground, and its not magnetic cable, you have to aim when you plug 'n.9, Battery life is just so so if you turn off phone's link.The Good:1, Building quality is good.2, Light weight.3, Soft band and comfortable.4, Monitors are close to accurate.So, If you want a high tech with better smooth feeling smart watch, go for Apple or Samsung, if you just want a sports watch, this one is ok, but not best.It is just an entry level watch, but Garmin should and can make it a better entry level watch, at least on software.",
            "I really wanted to like the simplicity of this watch, it reminded me of the Pebble time steel. Unfortunately the huge bezel on the lower part of the screen to accommodate the Garmin logo and more importantly the very weak vibration motor in order to receive notifications is almost non existent on this watch. I followed up with Garmin if they can fix the vibration alerts in a future software update but they appeared not to take customer complaints seriously. I had no choice but to return the watch for a refund.I ended up going with a 2017 Garmin Vivoactive 3 which has no bezel and strong vibration alerts at a killer price.",

            "Very fast delivery - arrived the following day (with standard shipping).Screen size if perfect for me. Setup was quick and easy. There are about 21 faces you can select from or customise your own. I turned the display up one level from the default and it is clear and easy to see in the sun.Heart rate monitor seems accurate.Battery has lasted me a week and that included a couple of days fairly heavy usage because I was so excited to play around with it when I first got it.Vibrate alarm wakes me up and does not disturb my wife.There are various training modes but I have only tried running. It tracked all my stats as expected.I'm really happy with my purchase and do recommend if you are looking for a smart watch in this price range.",
            "If you are primarily looking for a smart watch this is good value. If youre looking solely for a fitness tracking watch, this leaves a lot to be desired.You can view message previews, get call alerts and set alarms. Music can only be controlled if you are using the phones defult music player not a streaming service (spotify, audible, ect.)Fitness tracking is limited to the modes listed in the description and there is no defult general workout mode. Heart rate is inaccurate, even when worn above the wrist bone as directed. The step counter works like a normal pedometer so any rapid arm movement or jumping counts as a step.In my case i walked 700 steps in a 20min drive.GPS also seemed to have trouble working out distance.For those with sensitive skin keep in mind it comes with a silicone band. Personally it became to uncomfortable to wear for long periods so i cannot attest to its sleep functionality unfortunately.I primarily wanted a fitness tracker so i didnt find it good value in the end but if you intend to utilise all its functions its a perfectly fine watch. Has good battery and the app lets you change you watch faces and also create custom ones (background, text colour, but not layout)",
            "Nice touch display screen. Can download extra display screen types.Long battery life as stated and charging cable is cool - magnet.Tracks sleep and steps accurately.Nice screen size; not too bulky and fits my small wrist well.Notifications come through easily.Like that you can control music on the watch.App for the watch is user friendly - easy to pair.Very happy with the purchase, never owned a smart watch before and this is a very good entry level smart watch. If you need to reply texts or make phone calls and payments via the watch this is not the watch for you. It has good foundational features and is very easy to use.",
            "Liked how minimalistic the packaging was, watch, instruction manual, and magnetic charging cable which attaches to the back of the watch. For my tiny wrist, the wrist band of this watch was surprisingly accommodating (I went all the way to the second last notch available).The touch screen of the watch is responsive with a large enough dial (I can't imagine the dial being any larger for my wrist size).This smart watch is great for heart monitoring, step counting, sleep monitoring and if you do any sports/exercise, this watch is great value. It also connects to your mobile to display notifications from your mobile (actioning/responding to any of the notiications need to be done on your mobile).",
            "This SoundPEATS SmartWatch is the BEST value for money currently on the market......that it is waterproof enough for showering and swimming is worth the $50 - $60 price tag alone. There are 57 beautiful interfaces to choose from to suit everybody (male or female), the wrist band has multiple holes as part of the design so will fit small and large wrists.It very easily syncs with iPhone with downloadable app makes it easy to manage settings. Can display phone txt messages and notifications/messages from multiple apps like Instagram, Twitter and Whatsapp, can play music  linked from iPhone. Works with android phones too. Has 13 Sports modes, does everything a fitness watch should do including measuring heart/sleep/steps. A very comfortable watch and looks great. LOVE IT!",
            "It is inevitable that most smart watches (this one included) will be compared to 'that' brand-name watch and that is simply not fair. What this watch does, it does it well. While not mind-blowingly so, it does it at a fraction of the cost. It's design is simple and unobtrusive yet stylish. You can wear this with practically anything and it won't look off. It is light and comfortable to wear and I easily sleep with it on, something I find hard to do with other watches.Screen:The screen is well-designed screen with easy to understand menus and very bright colors to help you see the different functions and status of each one in particular. It\u2019s really cool. The display of the BPM is large and colors indicate the levels of intensity of your work out. I think the colors of each menu are a great help to understand your activities and goals in a clear visual way.I wore it overnight a couple of times to see what the sleep tracker reported. Interesting to see that I really do sleep as soundly as I thought!I bought this primarily as a fitness tracker to help track my heart rate when I\u2019m on the treadmill. As a test I measured my resting heart rate with a pulse ox monitor, my phone and the Watch1 and the results were all very consistent. Additionally, comparing my mileage against my phone and as measured on the treadmill the results are again very consistent. I like that it has a reminder to get up and get moving thru out the day. I don\u2019t think I realized exactly how long I tend to sit at my desk during the work day.All in all a great watch/fitness tracker, especially for the price. Would recommend without reservation.Added bonus, it looks great! First time I wore it out in public the very first person that saw it commented on my new slick watchBattery life is good, I haven\u2019t made it to 10 days, 7 days seems more like it but since this is my first fitness tracker I think I tend to check it more frequently than normal. I\u2019ve run it down to around 10% charge, connected it to the charger and been back to 100% in a couple of hours. Main take-away here is that I don\u2019t have to worry with charging it every single night.To say that this watch is packed with features would be an understatement and all this managed by a very intuitive app. I love it, especially when you consider you're getting all this for that shockingly low price! I would heartily recommend this to anyone.Again, it's an incredible value, but if I want to be nit picky, here is what I would say needs improvement:1. Display doesn't go all the way to the edge.2. Notifications. As I noted, it only displays texts and calls, nothing else. Wish it gave my Ring and email notices too.3. Music. It only controls tracks, not volume. No music storage. Personally, I always wear ear buds when I exercise, but I hate bringing my phone. Having music storage would be nice.4. Display doesn't have an always-on option. I know that it would really bite into battery life, but I wish I had the option to have always-on display in lieu of longer battery life.",
            "This product is amazing. Easy connectivity - it took no longer than a couple of minutes to connect and set up the app. The watch tracks all the vital data ie steps, calories and distance travelled. It also had other key features such as a stopwatch, monitor sleep etc. This feels like a high end watch for a fraction of the price. You can also receive notification on the watch, from messages to emails. Highly recommend!",
            "Arrived quickly. Light weight, and comfortable. I have small wrists and it still fits comfortably. Quick and easy to set up and seems to track accurately. I work with my hands in water all day and it's held up perfectly. Very pleased with how great it is, especially for the price!",
            "Really great looking watch that's comfortable to wear. For the price, it's fantastic value; with a good looking screen and fast interface. A great entry to smart watches with a quality watch at a low price, very impressed.",
            "Pleasantly surprised with this smart watch. Initial setup was super easy, with step by step prompts on the watch, Screen is a perfect size, and easy to read everything on the screen, good resolution. App on the phone is relatively easy to setup, you can customise what notifications you want to receive on the watch, which is super handy. This watch does everything it promises, with all of the health and fitness apps. It's comfortable to wear and lightweight. Most surprising is the battery life. I haven't needed to recharge it since turning it on, you would easily get 10 days use out of it. Price is also excellent considering the features that this smart watch delivers. Would highly recommend",
            "What a fantastic product. I have been wearing the SoundPeats Pro Watch 1 now for a week which I had upgraded from the SoundPeats Watch 1.It was very quick and easy to set up and configure and I loved all the different face options including the option of curating your own custom face.A beautiful interface with a premium product feel. The watch has always felt secure on my wrist and has been very responsive.I'll find it hard to swap back to the Watch 1 so maybe I'll gift it to my wife.I Highly recommend the SoundPeats Pro Watch 1",
            "I was skeptical purchasing a watch for this price, from past experiences buying big name brands budget options. However, I am pleasantly surprised the watch works smoothly out of the box, it is also very comfortable. My only minor gripes are nitpicky onesand that is the font and layout of notifications. Also the battery percentage is misleading as it only ranges from 0-25-50-75-100, a simple 4 bar system would be less misleading.",
            "Not accurate.Bought this as I have several pairs of the SoundPeat ear buds and was curious.Measured against my GPS and it is not accurate (see picture). Distance measured is at least 10% off. I don\u2019t feel the heart rate monitor and sleep tracker is accurate either but should be okay as an indicator.Acceptable for the price.Sorry SoundPeats...",
            "i am trying to love this watch, i bought it to record my bicycle rides, but after syncing it to my new oppo phone it disconnects after about 2 kilometers, and i need to restart the ride tracking, this happens with the walk mode also, if the tracking gets to 3 kilometres it usually works till the end. but i had to restart it 3 times on this mornings ride. just not good enough as reliability goes. i do love the way it tells you the time and distance and heart rate every kilometre, i love the variety of watch faces, the screen sensitivity is much better than the soundpeats watch 1 earlier version, maybe i just have a faulty one, when i received it it was 80% charged and had steps already on the watch, i thought that was strange like it was a used product. if it worked as intended i would give it 10 out of 10 but for me only 3, i will be returning it.",
            "If you mainly want this for the time and the smart features, It's a good purchase.I bought it mainly for the step tracker and heart rate monitor and both are highly inaccurate. Even as I type this I've been walking about for a couple of hours and it says 0. A little disappointed.",
            "This is a super well-valued watch that competes with the high end priced watches in the market.The 10-day battery under heavy use last around a week which is plenty of time between chargesThe waterproof capabilities are great allowing you to swim with this each on, take showers and you never have to worry about getting sweaty or going on an adventure.With an even bigger screen than the first version of text messages, notifications are easy to read and look great.active accurate tracking of heart rate, sleep and fitness tracking through 13 modes allows you to keep on top of your fitness and allows for progress reports.Finally, the watch is lightweight and style with multiple clock faces and one of the favourites features the music panel allowing you to play/pause and skip songs without taking your phone out.",
            "I've been looking at the high end $700+ smartwatches for health tracking and decided to take a shot and try the Soundpeats Watch Pro 1.  With the various tracking features this watch has I'm so glad that I saved a massive amount of money.  The variety of faces and the reporting and syncing with my phone (Samsung s8+) works well.  I like the size and based on the options and features would have expected it to cost a lot more.  My only downside is the size of the font when getting txt message alerts and the inability to change the sedentary reminder to 45mins but that's not a deal-breaker either.  Most dials have the ability to track steps, heart and Kcals and battery life so a glance often gives you what you need.  So for me an excellent device with a lot of features that hold up against the high priced market.",
            "I purchased this Smartwatch a few days ago for myself and it is really impressed how easy to use it.The package is compact and simple but it has all that you need.You can easily set up with phone using QR code in the manual.This watch can count calories and steps accurately and you can also check the weather (which I like), time, some notifications from your phone that you set up.The quality of the screen was very impressive. It is a good resolution and you can see it clearly in full sunlight with sunglasses on with the highest bright setting.The weight is pretty light and it feels good on my wrist. The strap is rubber with many holes and that makes to fit for everyone, teenagers, women and men.For the last but least, it is a great price for the quality! If you need just a simple, basic fitness watch, it will be one of the best options.",
            "Found this smartwatch is large for smaller wrists, both the size of the watch and the wrist band (will have to see if there's a shorter band that can be used), though not uncommon for most smartwatches. It's hard to find a true women's smartwatch.Not terribly accurate, though this may be because of how it sits on a smaller wrist.Other than that it works well with good battery life - good enough and a worthwhile purchase for a simple and affordable smartwatch.",
            "I really like this watch especially for the price. A couple thing I wish for would be to see the name of the song that's playing when I'm on the music screen and to reply to messages but I understand those are things in the higher end smart watches. Sometimes the weather is very off point though. For the price though it's really great."

            "The watch in general is nice,for the most part it's confortable, accurate and nice looking. However, it has a lot of issues. It sometimes feels like it's burning my wrist and it's not because of it heat up or sweat getting trapped between the watch and the skin. It feels like a chemical burn.The other issue is the poor responsiveness of the screen. I have to swipe lots of times for the swipe to register. When you touch the screen it doesn't wake the watch. Sometimes it feels like it's frozen but after 10-20 seconds it usually unfreezes.The haptic  button works really poorly too.I switched from a Vivoactive 4s. Garmin's app is much nicer, it has more data, more options and everything is free.",
            "If you don't intend to pay for features this watch not for you . Doesn't do anymore more then a basic $50 healthier tracker  Fir the money you pay shouldn't have to pay monthly for more in depth health and fitness tracking",
            "Great product BUT, no ability to store offline music on device except with Deezer and some other streaming service I've never heard of before. Previous fitbit models allowed you to store mp3's directly on the device, but that functionality has been removed. It would be nice if Fitbit at least supported offline storage for Spotify, the largest music streaming service. As of now all you can do is control spotify on your phone with the fitbit.The lack of offline music storage makes the gps they've added redundant, as I wouldn't want to work out without the ability to listen to music, so now I have to bring my phone with me which is what I wanted to avoid.If Fitbit fixes the music issue this would be a good product.The sleep tracking is good but overestimates time spent asleep. The fitness tracking overestimates your floors and steps. So both sleep and fitness tracking have  high sensitivity but lack specificity.",

Once, it did not show any text on the screen; in another case, it did not connect to the phone. Not a good impression for a recently bought electronic device.b) The Fitbit software on my phone is not user friendly. I suppose they wanted to create a health monitoring environment with other Fitbit devices, but I only use the watch, so I need to get access to the watch's details. I did not know that in advance. It was frustrating, and I had to spend an hour understanding the app.c) The market place for clocks is not wide. You have limited options, and I wouldn't say I liked the existing interfaces.d) The SpO2 measurement only happens when you sleep, and the device shows you an average. You cannot see it in real-time, or the measurements during the night.e) I like the Alexa app on the wrist. It makes it easy to control the Alexa in my house.",

It was a bit hard to get specifics on the SpO2 functionality on this version..  I was expecting a more interactive experience.  In fact it is more like the resting heart beat measure, done  overnight and averaged. It does not measure your SpO2 interactively throughout the day as it does with your heart rate. Disappointed.  Hoping is they upgrade software versions that more interactive component of measure gets introduced.  Looks good. Band is comfortable. And the software works.",

I don't like that even though I have a Spotify account - I have to have premium in order for it to work.

Had I purchased through FitBit directly I could get a refund, but because I purchased through Amazon I'm $300 out of luck.The clock won't show and when I swipe I still get the menu but when you tap on 'today' (or any others) it just sits in limbo. Is fully charged and just stopped working as of this morning.VERY disappointed and frustrated.",
            "I upgraded to this watch from the Versa Charge 4, and it is Significantly better.Always on display is an option on this watch unlike the charge 4.It is possible to respond to texts directly from the watch using voice input.It is also possible to take calls directly on the phone since two updates ago (at time of writing) - Audio quality is VERY Lackluster and not very loud, but it is a watch afterall.Google Assistant is supported.Notifications work fairly well.I Love the find my phone option.Just beware: Some applications and many nicer clock faces are stuck behind paywalls, as well as some of the more advanced Fitbit features. make sure you are aware of this before plunging into the Fitbit ecosystem.Honestly, the payment system for the clock faces is beyond iffy. Thankfully, I've gotten by with free clock faces.I Definitely do not like the default strap and went with a chain mail magnetic type strap, and also got a tempered glass protector. Without these upgrades, the watch would be way more uncomfortable and given it is large, it does snag on quite  a few things.",

Less pricey and without the unecessary apps I wouldn\u2019t normally use when busy being active I\u2019m happy! Would be way to distracting in my opinion.",
            "Step accuracy is a little off. I can wake up in the morning and have the watch reading roughly 50-60 steps when I have obviously been immobile. Although some mornings it does read zero.Battery life is more to 3 days with what I would consider average use. It might last 6 days if you just never ever looked at it or used sleep features.Alerts, calls or texts are complete hit and miss. If you want this watch to view texts on or hit the answer call button - DO NOT buy this. Roughly only 30% of texts received will show on the watch. With calls it will often not vibrate at all, or worse start vibrating 30 seconds after you have already answered the call. This is with use on an IPhone 8.Otherwise it\u2019s a good watch. Durable, attractive and the health features are very helpful.",

Not sure about the acuracy of the new features added as the SPo2. Even the shape of it, I wasn\u2019t too sure about. Functionality wise, its too similar to previous versas, not enough improvements to be worth upgrading, apart from a slightly bigger screen.",
            "Bought watch in February 2021. March 2021, the watch begins tracking too many floors per day. Apparently I climb anywhere from 80 to 180 floors per day. Chatted with Fitbit support a number of times and they are aware of the issue and there is no known fix. Had to go through their useless troubleshooting of a hard reset, a factory reset and then them telling me their engineer team is aware and should be fixed with an update. Update installed and still same issue. FitbIt will not recall their product or replace, even though my watch is less than a year old. Time to switch platforms.SAVE YOUR MONEY!! DO NOT BUY!This is happening to many Fitbit Versa 3 owners. Check Fitbit forum!",
            "I bought my Versa in September 2020.  I took a long time to read about it, set up everything that I possibly could to aid me with my goal (had a recent heart attack).  I find the information it gathers is not all that accurate, especially around heart rate, exercise levels, and, sleep patterns.  It's not at all the tool that it's cracked up to be....it's great for monitoring moving and exercise patterns but that's about it.  Now that I have had it for several months it will not hold a charge for more than 2.5 days!!!  This is very frustrating and trying to get somebody to deal with this is pretty well impossible.",
            "I was so excited to get this watch. But for $300, it is not at all what I expected. The notifications require me to restart my phone every day, even multiple times a day. The \"button\" on the left doesn't work. It I shut the watch down, the only way to turn it on is by charging it. I've watched YouTube videos on troubleshooting, but nothing works. It gets stuck on the always on display all the time, swiping and pressing the button doesn't work. It's basically a glorified step recorder. I've had a Garmin smart watch for years and never had a problem. I've been wearing this versa 3 for about a week, and nothing but issues.",
            "I don't hate it but I don't love it either. The tracking seems ok for this device simply refuses to connect to my phone and my wireless speaker which is very frustrating because I need to control my music etc while exercising without having to touch my phone. It says paired but my phone keeps telling me I need to turn off the device and turn it back on. I really doubt that this issue is my phone it connects easily to everything else. For some reason the watch connects to my TV (which I don't need) but not my phone. Also the app isn't user friendly at all. The app that comes with the cheap Amazon watch is way easier to use and more straightforward. That watch also had no issues connecting to my phone but the tracking with that one was horrible. Ugh...you can't win! Also I can't seem to figure out how to add an exercise that is not on the list on the watch. I do jump rope alot and I can't find it on the app or on the watch itself...sigh. I kept it because I needed to track my calorie burn but everything else isn't so great.",
            "I bought this for my wife, as an early birthday gift, since the screen on her old Fitbit was cracked and hard to read.She really likes my Versa 2 mostly for its bigger screen.The major benefit that I see of the Versa 3 over the Versa 2 is the charger.The charger for the Versa 2 clips onto the watch while the charger for the Versa 3 uses magnets to hold the charger to the watch.This was kind of a bummer as I was hoping that we'd have the same charger, but the magnetic charger that comes with the Versa 3 is definitely better.",
            "I've been using this watch for the last three months and it is the worst fitness watch. It's a very expensive step counter. It doesn't track my heart rate very well. I often use a row machine 20 minutes 4/week , and there are many days my heart will be jumping from my chest, and it tracks my herart rate between 70-90 BPM for 20 minutes.- When I lift weights, it tracks it at 75 BPM.- Never tracks my sleep- And many of the days it tell me I climbed 300 floors (IMPOSSIBLE)DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS WATCH.Such a frustrating product. I should have spent the money and bought an APPLE",
            "This is the third fitbit I have purchased over the last 6 years.  The first two self destructed when I sweat on them (which I think defeats the purpose).  While this one does not disintegrate when moisture hits it, it disconnected from my phone twice - I had to factory reset the device to re-pair with my phone.  I am disappointed that I spent so much money for a device which after many years on the market, and so many updated versions, is STILL not properly functional.",
            "The Fitbit Versa 3 is the latest version of the Versa and has some nice updates including GPS. I am still learning how everything works but must say it is a big improvement over the Versa 1 that I have. The styling has changed and the straps have changed too so I cannot use the multiple straps I have for the Versa 1. I like the new style charger with the magnetic back and think it is an improvement over the old style one. I only wish they made medium length straps instead of just short or long. Overall very happy",
            "I researched quite a few options for smartwatches and felt the Versa3 was going to be the best fit for what I wanted. I was very wrong.6 day battery life; nope. 3 dayNotification system is flawedGoogle assistant fails to set up properly.Steps are inaccurate. (I did 300 in my sleep?)Sleep tracking seems good, although a feature I wanted, not enough to offset the rest.Will be returning the watch and won't be returning to FitBit(Spent an hour on live chat to attempt resolution only to be told to try the same things listed in the troubleshooting guides - after stating I've tried everything in the trouble shooting)",
            "The heart rate number on the face of the watch is very tiny.  My bifocals barely make it out.  It\u2019s too bad that there is not a clock face option (there are a number of clock faces to choose from) that enlarges the size of the heart rate number.  It does increase in size when you start a timed exercise session, but I was hoping for a device that I could use to monitor my heart rate at a glance throughout the day.  This seems like an odd mistake to make in the design given that the heart rate tracker is a feature that the company emphasizes.",

            "Absolutely terrible. The first watch I received would sync to my phone for 24 hours and then disconnect. I tried resetting and restarting my phone and the watch and deleting the app/reinstalling it and, called customer service which is when I received a replacement watch. It worked for 48 hours and then did the same thing. The calories burned and steps are very inaccurate; I watch and track my steps at some points and it was never correct. It's such a shame because I love some of the features this watch has. I was able to answer phone calls and speak through my watch (phone nearby) and reply to messages (voice to text or quick reply) which is really convenient when I'm at work. Unfortunately this did not last long and for this amount of money it's absurd. I'm not trying for a third time but the other reviews of not syncing propely or always disconnecting from the phone or inaccuracy are true. Save your time and look for something else.",
            "The watch is comfortable, it tells time and it seems relatively accurate in counting steps. Beyond that, it just doesn\u2019t do what it is supposed to do.  It does not track my sleep on a regular basis. I\u2019ve tried it in several spots, on both wrists and my wife has worn it. It tracks sleep about once every 3 days.  It also does not count active minutes past 1. Earlier this week, I did a full work out and got 1 active minute. Tonight my wife and I were on a very brisk walk, long walk, her fitbit calculated 41 active minutes, mine calculated, you guessed it, 1 active minute. It also loses connection to my phone on a regular basis. Unfortunately, I am beyond the 30 return period.",

Lov\u00e9 th\u00e9 sleep app, the heart rate monitor the step counter and exercise GPS tracker for my runs. Everyday I find out some thing new that it does that i didn\u2019t know it could do.

            "I had fitbit versa 2 before because of the ability to add music.I love it for that.I got versa 3 because of the fact that in addition to the music I had GPS so no need to crowd yourself with the phone.Little that I know that I will need to pay for deezer or spotify in order to have music on my phone.I did not want to pay an additional montly fee for that.So my extra cost for versa 3 is useless if only for GPS.I do not need GPS on my Elliptical or my static bike. However,I always need music.Now I ended up with two Fitbits for no reasons.I am really disappointed.I saw somewhere that they were planning to make deezer or spotify free with fitbit but I don't know if it is true.For now you need premium to use either deezer or spotify.I don't really give much weight to the sleep feature because it is not accurate.In addition , I have no choice than to remove my watch because I started to get some rash when I keep the watch too long on my wristThat is another thing I don't get.",
            "The features of this watch are not aligned with your health, they are with the business model of Fitbit.A lot of features are behind a monthly subscription but are displayed in your face so you know you miss something. There is no reasons for the monthly prices as those features are supported by the watch and the app, it\u2019s just another way to keep a hand in your pocket.The interface is complicated and unnecessary, they try to cram as much functionality as possible and loose track of simplicity, ease of use and the need for a health tracking watch.The app drained my phone in a few hours, used to run all day no problem.They try to sell you to use Fitbit \u2019Pay\u2019, who want to pay with their watch when everybody has a cellphone.Conclusion:make your life more complicated, going for a returnpositive:-battery last a long time, many days-seems sturdy",
            "As an older lady I love my fit bit. It is great to wear and took a little to figure out but in the end it was simple to figure out and use. I wear it daily and have not had any issues. I was nervous to wear this as my last Fitbit had made my arm feel like it had been burnt from the lights. This one has not done that to date.  Hopefully it doesn't.Enjoying it and would recommend it!",
            "Main interest is health tracking, esp sleep. Stats helpful. Fitness tracking very good, flexible and programmable. Clock faces a useful feature. Many to choose among and many customizable. Soft button works for me, some seem to dislike. Telephone feature impressive. Tiny speaker so must raise wrist towards head but very clear to caller. Google Assistant syncing useful to see calendar, caller name, etc. Overall wouldn't want to give up!",
            "I had the Fitbit inspire, and i loved it. But i had no idea all the features that the versa 3 had. It was on sale so i bought it and i couldn't be happier. Everything works on it really well, i especially love being able to use my watch to make purchases without my phone. I've downloaded some helpful apps like the barcode one so that i have my airmiles card on there, as well as others. I love that i can answer calls and send text messages hands free, super easily, while driving and on the go. The mic picks up what you say extremely well, so i use my watch a lot for things like the Google assistant to set reminders and open Spotify on my phone, etc. I've read the negative reviews of others, i personally haven't had any of those issues. My only issue has been figuring out how to turn it off and on without a physical button. It takes me a while to get that to work, but I've only turned it off and on once since getting it a month ago which was just to test it. I think that's more of a user error though. All in all, it's a great watch. I'd buy another one for my husband, I think it is worth the price for all that it does. But since I got it on sale I'd like to wait for it to go down again before repurchasing lol",
            "I bought the watch a few days ago because I wanted to track my health all around and it was a nightmare in the first 2 hours. I'm a software developer and I struggled to set up the wifi because the instructions were not clear in case your phone is set to randomize your MAC address (therefore making it impossible to connect to the wifi in the watch). Another annoying thing after that (and I had to call support for this) was to sync with my phone. It literally didn't go past 5% for hours and hours then I had to call. Did take a few hours after support gave me guidance on how to do the sync using just the bluetooth but finally got it to work.Sleep track I didn't find accurate and notifications from my phone sometimes it would take longer to appear.Good things about it was being able to interact with spotify, heart rate measure and step tracking. I didn't test the other features, I just ended up returning it today. It was WAY below my expectations.",
            "Another good watch from fitbit. Everything works as expected when it actually works. I have had many issues with connecting, Fitbit support was not helpful but after watching videos on YouTube I was able to fix the problem. The button on the left side is easily pressed so making sure you set the right option is key (not the assistant feature).",

            "As per usual, I love the software interface of FitBit\u2019s products, but I find their hardware lacking. The products scratch or bands break far too quickly for the price point. This is a smart watch meant for active people, so there is little to no excuse for the glass and metal on the watch face to be this poor of quality.I also find the notification settings to be super finicky on this watch as I did with the Ionic, previously. They never pop up no matter how many times I fix the settings to have them show.I purchased the screen protectors for this version of the Fit Bit however, since they fully cover the screen (unlike the Ionic protectors), you can\u2019t wear this item in the shower or get it wet. The protector holds all of the moisture. Even without it, it leads to poor visibility of the screen.Basically, good effort, poor execution. Sorry guys!",
            "The GPS is very unreliable.  Some workouts it is able to track and map my workout, other it just craps out.  I can see how a tall building or a deep valley could mean missing a few minutes of data, but this is a semi-urban setting with small hills and the occasional apartment building.  My phone GPS works fine for these same types of workouts.",
            "This thing is completely overpriced given the function and the poor design. It is so user-unfriendly.  The screen is not responsive at all. A lot of the time, you can't even light the screen. There is a button, but it is in an awkward position, and it is not a regular button, it's a kind of pressure sensor, but you have to push it very hard. Poor design.",
            "J\u2019ai achet\u00e9 la Fitbit Versa 3 \u00e0 titre de remplacement de ma Fitbit Charge 2. La principale raison du changement \u00e9tait la capacit\u00e9 de recevoir des appels au poignet et d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 plusieurs applications suppl\u00e9mentaires. Apr\u00e8s comparaison avec d\u2019autres produits similaires offerts par d\u2019autres compagnies, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de demeurer avec Fitbit en raison de la qualit\u00e9 du produit ainsi que la long\u00e9vit\u00e9 de la pile.",
            "So i really like every other feature i can answer a call directly from my watch with my iphone but for some reason you cant quick reply or use the mic to reply to messages seems odd but i still like it also i noticed not very many banks are supported for the wallet in canada other than those two things its perfect",
            "Screen cracked within 2 months while eating supper one evening when it bumped a glass of water so hard it didn't spill a drop. Frustrating yes but everything still worked till a few days ago. About six months of having it and now the screen doesn't work at all. Searching online for parts to repair (fitbit does not repair their own products) in the process found alot of similar complaints online about this. My last fitbit lastrd 3 years amd I know it did more than bump a glass and only reason for upgrade was battery didn't last more than a day after 3 years. Now debating which brand to buy.. thinking garmin as this has left me pretty sour.. 300$ down the drain.",
            "Let me start by saying I've only used no name brand trackers. I love this one. Screen is so clear. Easy to set up and use. App is easy to navigate. I don't like that battery is not replaceable but hopefully that won't matter. I don't know how accurate it is for heart rate but it seems proper. Would buy again.",
            "You have to keep the app open all the time to be able to use many of the features, uses data and phone battery which is annoying. Battery life is terrible even when set on dim. Had to buy a fabric strap as the included strap made me break out in hives. Previously had a 4 year old Fitbit charge 2 and it never gave me any issues so I thought I\u2019d upgrade. Wish I hadn\u2019t.",
            "J' ai achet\u00e9  la Versa 3 parce que pour une \"Smart watch\" elle garde sa charge longtemps. Je la porte depuis lundi, nous sommes vendredi et j'ai encore 45% de charge restant. Je marche quotidiennement et utilise le GPS, elle fonctionne avec la voie puis je re\u00e7ois mes messages.  Je l'adore.",
            "I absolutely love my Versa 3 Fitbit! I upgraded after 3 years of using the Alta HR and the upgrade was 100% worth it! My goal is set to 10k steps and I use all the features, from heart rate, to sleep and O2 tracker. The size of the screen is perfect as it displays everything on one screen including the time. Additional positive is the ability to personalize the background of the screen!Overall, 10 stars and definitely recommend!",
            "The amount of time this stays charged is amazing. A couple of minor issues for me is how difficult it is to have the watch turn on to show the time it needs to be more sensitive to the wrist movement and my watch is two minutes off from my phone and I don\u2019t know how to adjust the time even though the app is on my phone and syncing with it.",
            "This watch is super cool. I originally had the Versa 2 but I was having a lot of difficulties with it connecting to my phone and I had it for 1 week until I exchanged it for the 3. The Versa 3 is 10x better with connection and there are more benefits to it then the Versa 2.",
            "Pas encore un produit parfait, mais tellement mieux que la version pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente !Un gros must de ne plus avoir besoin de son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone en permanence pour courir et suivre notre parcours...",
            "Incredibly inaccurate while in exercise mode. Reads heart rate of 90-110 at peak of my exercise (heart rate reading 156 or above on ellipitical sensers). Incredibly inaccurate with calorie counting, at least 60-100 off each workout. As someone doing calories-in calories-out I spent more on this watch to get a better count. Returned after 2 weeks!",
            "Shipped fast, product is amazing. I am upgrading from a charge 2 to this versa 3 and it is like I jumped into the future! I was surprised with all of the integration features available on the versa 3. It was a very good decision and I am super happy with it!",
            "I only use the basic features, but these are great: move reminders, step tracking, heart rate, alarms, alternate watch faces, etc. I avoid GPS so far because of high battery drain. I especially love the new design for both the watch band and the charging mechanism.",
            "It is burning my wrist. And leaving sores on on my wrist. It also fell off my wrist and broke on the floor. I am going to complain to fit bit and make sure I get a new one because it wasn't my fault the clasp undid and it fell off.",
            "I've just started using it and love it. Great replacement for my Charge 2. A few hiccups with setting up, but easy fixes on Youtube and at the Fitbit support site. Flip flopped between this and an Apple Watch, glad I went this direction as it's got all I need.",
            "I\u2019ve had my watch for just over a month. I went skiing last week and fell just once.  And the face of the watch smashed.  I didn\u2019t hit a rock or my pole or ski with my watch.  I was wearing gloves and my jacket over my watch.  For a watch that\u2019s supposed to be used for activity, it\u2019s sure fragile.  I\u2019ll be returning mine as I need something that is durable and will last longer than 6 weeks.",
            "The Versa 3 is fine and does the job as advertised. Looks good ... for what that\u2019s worth. However, DO NOT expect it to sync with, in my case, an iPhone with any reliability whatsoever. You can read any community forums and quickly see this is a problem experienced by many users. Be aware and be ready to continually accept that the sync will fail and you will need to: reboot your phone, reboot the app, reinstall the app, toggle your Bluetooth, and whatever else you will be advised to do through the Fitbit forum. Have owned this product for 5 weeks now. I\u2019d be happy to hear from Fitbit.....",
            "Works and behaves as described my wife loves it - steps measurements are not as accurate as it seems but at least gives you an average result from this type of experience.  Thank Amazon for amazing service! Product arrived within 48hrs as promised!",

If you join fit bit premium you get access to so many programs,recipes,challenges.Instead of joining a well known weight loss app,  Fitbit versa 3 has all the same features.

            "Just received the watch. Really responsive, the newer strap feels better than my versa 2 I'm replacing.Not sure about the button difference as yet. My Versa 2 was best watch ever but I scratched the glass a bit ,my fault totally.",
            "I upgraded to the Versa 3 from a Fitbit Charge 3 and the difference is amazing. I love the sharp screen colors, the accurate on-board GPS and the interface to Alexa and my phones texting & calling. Despite reading about the annoying \"button\" I have had no trouble with it at all.Using the GPS downgrades the battery life from the claimed 6 days but it still is one of the longest lasting batteries for a smart watch.I would definitely recommend this product.",
            "My heart rate readings were too far off. It said my resting heart rate was around 15bbm too higher than it was (compared to a chest strap readings using actual electrocardiography). Therefore not actually useful as a fitness watch.",
            "So much better than the versa 2 its so much more accurate and it says its bigger but really don't notice it and as for charge on it, its been since release date and its at 70% and the charger is magnetic which I love",
            "Don't waste your money on a sense, buy this one instead.  You can thank me later for the $125 you just saved!",
            "I love how the fitbit devices stop working properly even after 1 month of having a brand new one. The stairs climbed and step factor stopped registering properly. It also does not accurately track my heart rate and I\u2019ve worked out to the point of almost fainting because my heart rate on my fitbit will not register. I\u2019ve only had this for less than 2 months\u2026",
            "The way I see it voice assistance is the best part about having a smart watch.  And of course apple has you by the \u26bd\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc0 Only Siri is able to run on a locked screen.  And you need Google or Alexa for voice assistance to work but as soon as the screen locks goodbye voice assistance.  And there is nothing to be done about it.I never wanted a stupid Iphone for this reason, but it\u2019s what my kids ended up getting so here we are \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0fSo many more options and better cameras with Android phones.  Sigh",
            "I love my Fitbit Lite. So I upgraded to FITBIT V3 for nearly $300. Looking forward for a  better and nicer watch, it is a big disappointment. The small print display of this V3 is so blur that urge my feeling to throw it away. It is a waste of my money.",
            "To be honest, I don\u2019t have any complaints.The GPS works fine. I have to sync with the app all the time, but this is not a issue for me.What I didn\u2019t like was that we can not use the SPOTIFY app unless you have Spotify PREMIUMThis smartwatch is like a \u201ccoach\u201d for me. I am really enjoying my new gadget.",
            "In general, I don\u2019t find the screen very responsive to being woken up, it disconnects from my phone once or twice a day, and it does not play well with my iPhone. My bad, I should have done more research, but it cannot answer a call or respond to a text. This is deal breaking for me. I will use it for now and upgrade to an Apple Watch eventually. My Android friends don\u2019t have the same issues.",
            "As an iPhone user, I hesitated a lot about buying a FitBit or an Apple watch. To be honest, this FitBit has been really great. It looks really nice, the battery lasts very long, the app works very well and keeps track of all of the things that I need (steps, sleep, calories). It gives me notifications from my phone (which I cannot respond to) but I am ok with that. It is a great product.",
            "Set up",
            "I replaced my versa 2 with the versa 3. I love the voice response feature to texts and messages instead of standard built in replies. I use the timer and alarms daily. Good sleep tracking, syncs well, nice big screen.",
            "I normally don't write reviews but this is ridiculous. The battery life is garbage and notifications hardly show up. I have a Samsung watch as well and wanted to switch over to this one because I heard the tracker was better. What a waste of $300. I'm extremely disappointed and wish I never bought this thing",
            "This is my first Fitbit and I'm not sure it was worth the price compared to all of the other off-brand versions that are avail off of Amazon.  Purchased one for me and a different one for my son.  His does all that mine can do but was 2/3rds cheaper.  I'm hoping that Fitbit will have apps avail for this watch... it feels great, but doesn't seem like much of an improvement over the Versa 2.  Wish I could put my own music on this one....",
            "The watch cover broke and no replacement available in singapore. No concept of after sales service .",
            "I have had this watch since December 2020 and have had to get it replaced already. The watch does not count floors climbed accurately (says I climbed 152 one day!) and when I contacted Fitbit Support they said it's a know issue and they are \"working on it\". No refund, no exchange, just \"deal with it\". I would not recommend this watch, or any other Fitbit product for that matter. They do not back their product and have no interest in resolving issues.",
            "Haven\u2019t figured out all the benefits of this tracker but so far it\u2019s great. Love the GPS feature and how it records your routes. I found the sleep app a bit inaccurate because if you are awake but laying still it thinks you are asleep.",
            "Cool watch but ended up being too big/bulky for me (I\u2019m a female and my wrists are thin). The functionality is so much better though than the previous versions and display is bright",
            "The battery life is not what it says it does...6 day lifespan...go it yesterday, fully charged it and it already at 25 percent a day later...I also noticed the Bluetooth signal range is not as good as the versa 2 either...disappointed with the upgrade....",
            "For an almost 400 watch its pretty laggy,  this my first smart watch ever and was kinda expecting more. It non responsive at times and things like logging water intake are very tedious do to the lag. I'm using it right out of the box as is. Not sure yet if I'm keeping it.",
            "The food tracker needs to be more user friendly. Adding food from your lists does not always work so you have to enter them manually.  You use to be able to copy meals to other days, not know. It just seems like a lot of work. You can\u2019t change the amounts using the + - signs so you have to enter them again.  All the categories should be alphabetical. The iPad version is just not user friendly.  I love Fitbit but it needs some work.",
            "the band caused a major skin irritation to my wrist area. I had to remove the watch. Not sure if the band is the problem. I ought to have returned it when it damaged my skin.",

            "Love it. Easy menus. Workout mode is great. If wearing earbuds it updates me every 1km stats. It warns me when my hr is too high. The health app has so much data. I can share a video of my walk map to friends or social media.The battery life has been fantastic. My previous fitbit battery life was terrible compared to this.I also like having my music loaded onto my watch, so i can walk without carrying my phone.It pairs to my devices easily and the BT connection is good. I have a huawei phone, but i think the only advantage of that is the different watch faces you can download which i like but I could easily live with just the preloaded ones.It looks great, i was worried it might be too big but I love it.Also the watch band does not irritate me like my old fitbit band did.So i definitely recommend this watch.",
            "I do not use all of the features and especially not all the time. During the night I switch the watch off and a single battery charge last about six weeks. This is if you do not you all features, just the important ones. Compared to my former smartwatch, made by the so-called market-leader, I had to charge the watch every day. How annoying was this. This smartwatch by Huawei lets you forget that you have a battery-driven mini-computer on your wrist that is not just power-hungry. When people ask me what brand this is I simply say: \"Its a Rolex\". People look embarrassed but the GT2 by Huawei is excellent and so much better than the competition. What a shame that political and ideologically opinion are often damaging the image of an excellent product. Who cares, I call it My Rolex. Believe it or not.",
            "I bought the Huawei GT2 after I returned a Samsung Galaxy 3 smartwatch that I got for Christmas (the Galaxy 3 continually disconnected from my phone, it had problems sending through most notifications, and Samsung said that it needed to be repaired when I contacted them even though it was brand new).  I've been very impressed the GT2 as an alternative.  Does what I need it to (fitness tracking, sleep tracking, notifications, ability to take calls on the watch when driving), but it's half the price.  Beautiful screen and excellent battery life.  The bonus watch strap is a nice addition.",
            "From the minute I first put the watch on it did everything I needed. Very easy to use, I have a Samsung Galaxy S9+ and the Huawei health app works seamlessly with the watch. I'm a collector of watches and haven't taken it off for the past month. As for the battery life it blew me away and almost lasted 2 weeks between charges.  The fitness sections of the watch are brilliant with many different types of activities it can track. I love it because it also tracks my stress levels and helps me keep it under control.  I also wear it whilst swimming and came with a high quality silicone band and a leather one if you want to dress up and be fancy. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommended it to anyone.",
            "I could not care where an item is manufactured at is the value and quality I get for my hard earned money! If the Chinese are better in the manufacturing of electronics I can not care. This is the third watch I purchase from Huawei and I use each of them for any occasion at a time. This model is especially elegant and it suits me when I am dressed for an elegant occasion. My Rolex is mothed in and I did not use it since I purchased my first Huawei watch GT some years ago. I have the Huawei G50Pro phone, I love, and I have the three watches and I am very happy with the performance. By the way, Leica cameras in the phones are the best one can purchased and the company is way back from an area Germany loves to forget and so do I, nevertheless, just as Huawei, the products are as good as can be. And so is this watch. Simply elegant.",
            "A good little watch. Quite happy with it although there are a couple of things which I find don't meet expectations, likely due to my assumptions of functionality rather than any technical failing.Firstly, I expected of be able to answer calls with the watch, but I can only decline calls.I also expected to be able to respond to messages, but no.And I'm yet to find an instance of two-week battery life; typically it's a week and a half, with little GPS'ing.Bake for money, I still rate it. I bought it in survival and it is actually a nice looking watch with predictable interfaces.",
            "I bought it to replace my XiaoMi amazfit watch, I basically seeking a watch with these features:1. long battery life2. GPS for running3. NFC optional to buy snack without wallet4. Durable and waterproofHuawei GT2 match all these and it's much cheaper than other brand like Garmin.The watch faces are also nice which I did not expect.The only thing not perfect is that it's a bit sensitive when I lift my wrist the watch light up too easily.But it's just me, maybe some one like it more sensitive, :D",
            "I don't need all the fancy functions from most smartwatches. Exercise and sleep tracking is what I really need, but battery life is my main concern.I am coming from an amazfit bit (30-45 days of battery) looking for a better screen and more functions, and this is an excellent replacement for it.I have just taken it from my wrist 2 times on the last month for charging, exactly was I was looking for. Pick up a call in the watch when driving or working is another real plus.I am considering another one for my wife, she also love it",
            "Purchased this watch after my smart watch of a rival brand died (still waiting on warranty claim). I have had the watch for a few weeks now and am pretty impressed. The battery life is very good. I use on average around 10% each day which includes GPS use during my runs. This is much better than my previous fitness smart watch. On the topic of fitness features, it tracks my runs accurately and measures heart rate and the associated Health App analyses your work outs into a range of measurements which I find pretty useful. The screen is big and bright and still sharp when reading it outside on sunny days. One downside would probably be a lack of quality watch faces to choose from. There is a couple of faces that I like but many are just weird with unusual combinations of font and colour. Overall though, happy with my purchase.",
            "This watch is brilliant - looks great, amazing battery life, the microphone and speaker are both clear for taking calls, I'm enjoying the health and sleep tracking and all the detailed analysis and helpful suggestions from the app. The only issue is that I didn't realise it did not support Strava, and it appears there is no plan to do so in future. It's a real shame, as everything else about the watch has exceeded my expectations.",
            "The watch face looks good, feels solid and feels is a legitimate thing to wear in font of even your swankiest friends.The strap is plasticy and brings down the product. It came damaged with a noticeable crease. There was no spare in the box as advertised in the title.After charging I can not progress to use the watch, even to tell the time, until it is paired with a phone.I can not see anything in the advertisement specifying owning a phone is necessary to use the watch, or I would not have made this purchase.The puck is very light and ugly. It is so light that the kinks in the USB cable lift it of the desk. It wont stay put without blue-tack.I take my watch off at night, and want to put it at my night stand. The charger is a bright white plastic that will appear as a blemish on any nightstand. Coupled with the blue tack to stop it moving, it's a major eyesore to the bedroom.",
            "The battery life is amazing. It really lasts for up to 2 weeks. Love the overall design of the watch and the heart rate monitoring technology is very accurate. Some great professional sports training modes and a precise GPS positioning system stand this watch out from its competitors. The watch seamlessly connects with my iPhone as well as my Huawei phone through the Huawei Health App. However, I'll strongly recommend to download the latest version of Health App from Huawei App Gallery. Sleep tracking is also a very strong feature and the recommendations to improve your sleep are amazingly accurate. It is truly my everyday life assistant. BUT, BUT, BUT, please be careful when you're purchasing this product. Please make sure that you purchase from Amazon AU store only because they are the ones with official Huawei AU stock. There are heaps of grey sellers such as Wireless Experts AU, The Around Australia, who do not sell Australian stock of Huawei products on Amazon and therefore, you'll not be entitled to official Huawei AU warranty should you end up buying products from these grey sellers.",
            "Going into purchase, I had already done quite a bit of research and the selling points were the fitness tracking features and great battery life. The GT2 42mm definitely does not disappoint in those departments.The fitness tracking is on par with what other more expensive fitness tracking bands offer and the battery life is GREAT, you can easily go 5 - 7 days without charging the watch once. On top of that, the watch itself is sleek and minimal looking, which I love.If the above is what you're looking for, then the GT2 42mm will fit the bill.If you're looking for a smart watch that integrates with other aspects of your life like messaging, controlling other apps, etc, then this may not be the watch for you.",
            "very good product, I could never go back to apple after having this watch, I charge every 10 days or so and I workout every day. would be nice to have more watch faces to choose from, but the ones they have are ok. Would also love to be able to since my music to it, but this is more of an apple issue as they don't allow it.",
            "This watch arrived yesterday, and like most items that are delivered, I was excited to try it out.  The watch itself is well made, and the screen is bright.  One of the main reasons I purchased the watch was to monitor heart rate, sleep, and Sp02.  Unfortunately all of these things appear to be linked to the optical heart rate monitor, which won't work through tattoo sleeves.  That leaves the only other benefits as the workout tracker, which seems to be slightly off from a GPS and timing point of view when compared to an iphone (watch was connected to my Samsung, with workouts in parallel), and the music storage option, which allows me to leave my phone at home when training.  I've only tried the workout tracker on cycling so far, so will give the running workout a go later on.  Unfortunately there is no auto pause option on the workouts, so will need to remember to hit the \"up\" button to pause at traffic lights.It did look like the pace wasn't being recorded on my bike ride this morning, but I'll know more after my run as I need the pace notifications during the run.Extremely disappointed so far. :-(",
            "Battery life is good, I got about 9 days with plenty of changing watch faces and trying new features in the first week. 14 days is theoretically possible but with the bare minimum of interaction so not really what you will get in practice. I am recharging each week because its easy to remember to charge every Sunday for example and I still have several days up my sleeve just in case. Some of the features seem to work well but I can't vouch for their accuracy (sleep states, stress levels) I don't think they are very accurate, more for fun.",
            "Amazing screen and battery life, took a while to figure out how notifications work but couldn't be happier, especially at the price got it for, don't even need my glasses to read the screen \ud83d\udc4d, edit, best watch ever, never realised how handy taking and making calls from the watch would be 10 stars\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",
            "Watch looks pretty good and rich. Battery life is approximately 10 to 12 days. Worst thing of this watch is the notifications are off automatically after few days and then to get it back you have to reset the watch also re install the app..I hate that.Overall feedback is not worth the price.",
            "The watch worked reasonably well with my 6 year old OPPO phone on Android 5.1.1.13 and so much better than the Samsung Watch.  Samsung health will not install on  Android 5.1.1.13 although the other Samsung watch software will.Data displayed on Huawei Health Application is not the same or as accurate as that recorded on the Watch.  For running, Heart Rate, Charts the breakdown of the run is incorrect showing most of the time in Fat Burning and Warm up where as the watch correctly show Extreme, Anaerobic & Aerobic time missing from the Health App.  Why even when fully synced this critical data is incorrect in the Health App?Will test with an updated version of the Health App.  Google Play for some reason are distributing an older version??Huawei support were very helpful and very fast to respond and offer assistance but have no solid solutions. Subsequent use has exposed further serious bugs and limitations widely reported but apparently unresolved by Huawei technical support."

            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0Ticwatch E3 ticks most of the boxes when it comes to features. Minimalist design with latest snapdragon 4100 at a budget friendly price. From step counting to O2 level monitoring this watch is packed with features. Silicon strap that comes with the watch is good quality. Even though the watch feels a bit bulky at 12.6mm, it is very comfortable to wear. I haven't tried all the workout modes but normal step counting, sleep tracking seems to work fine.Snap 4100 chip paired with 1gb ram makes the watch work without any issues. I haven't faced a single lag yet. Battery seems to last good with 24hr Heartrate and O2 level monitoring, fully charged last day and after 20 hrs of normal usage still got 40% left.Calls can be answered straight from the watch and the speaker is loud enough for an indoor environment. Mic quality is decent no one complained about my voice being distorted or too low.LCD display is one of the drawbacks of the watch but it is sharp and colours are good. Sunlight legibility is not an issue but the brightness needs to be increased manually since there is no ambient light sensor present. Double click on the top button increases the brigntess to maximinum for a small amount of time which helps under direct sunlight.Overall for the price this watch is very good. Considering the fact that Google will be releasing the wear OS 3.0 in early 2022, Ticwatch E3 will be one of the watches to get it.",
            "Design and Build:-impressive design , stylish frame, which makes the watch look amazing, has a good build and light weight but there\u2019s one flaw that it\u2019s design makes its screen extremely prominent to damage while use .Features and OS:- The google wear OS works very fine on this beautiful watch along with its connectivity features ( nfc, Bluetooth,wifi), first watch I have seen with Google pay at this price point, it makes payment convenient efficiently. Watch faces offered by Mobvoi are a big bonus\ud83d\ude0d.It has many workout modes, I have tried 4 of those and they worked out pretty accurate with your workout and health details. It has swim workout tracker that is a very extraordinary feature as it lets your track your activity and health details while swimming( so amazing \ud83e\udd2f ). It can even track your sleep \ud83d\ude34.Battery and charging:- The charging speed of this watch is impressive( it charges at an amazing speed). Battery life is good, lasts 2 days on normal mode but it drains very quick while tracking any workout or if you use it while connected to wifi.CONCLUSION:- an all rounder attractive looking smartwatch with an extremely affordable price tag. There are some minor flaws though, but they can be ignored by that extremely affordable and competitive price tag. Rest everything about this watch is beautiful.\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf",
            "Honestly a great all round budget smart watch, if you're worried about future proof of this watch, no need to. The snap dragon 4100 built into this watch is more than capable of scrolling through the apps and notifications super smoothly. Was very surprised of the performance. With Samsung and Google's collaboration this year, wear os (the operating system) is due to get a revamp which has already been confirmed for this watch, which I can't wait for. The battery life is OK... If you have a watch face that doesn't show too much you'll have more than a day of use. Style of this watch is one thing I was kinda disappointed about. The big bezzels are distracting to the eye as well... But if you're looking for a smart watch that does everything a $400 Samsung watch 4 does, and your on a budget? This is a pretty damn good option for the price.",
            "This definitely is the coolest smartwatch I\u2019ve owned so far.Looks - 5 stars - I\u2019ve always admired watches with a round dial against the square, rectangle ones.It was easy to set-up. Really cool watch faces available and can be changed with a single tap and is updated within seconds.Looking forward to set-up Google pay and use other features such as being able to respond to texts and taking calls from the watch.Very reasonably priced keeping in mind the features it offers in comparison to other brands. Will definitely recommend.",
            "Bought this watch, arrived on time, maybe not my lucky day.. :(. Sadly my wife not very happy when she saw green vertical lines on the lcd screen after she switched On.We end up to return it back and choose another brand instead."

            "While I do wish the band was slightly wider, so the text could be larger and easier to read, Im happy with it in just about every aspect. It works well, and Im pleased with the data it provides. The app useful and informative, but it is annoying to have to keep going between \"device\" and \"health\" tabs to do different things, which I suppose is how they organise it to cater to people with multiple devices. It just makes it more troublesome for those like me with only one. The reason I give tyhe product and overall 2, however, is because os the unforgivable app permissions. The app outright cannot be used without putting in my personal phone number, so that it can confirm who I am. Why the F does it need to know who I am? And given this is Huawei we are talking about, you'd think they'd know better than to go sticking their nose into people's privacy. The app also continually asks for permissions that it doesnt need, and it keeps asking and asking. I will never give in; I just say no every time. So, great device, if you dont mind the mindset of the the company, which wants to know ALL about you.",
            "This smart watch is great. You can change your watch faces by downloading via the Huawei health app. There are 96 workout modes to choose from. You can check your pulse, amount and quality of sleep, oxygen levels, stress levels. It has a cute reminder cartoon which tells you to get up and move around. It displays the weather. You can read text messages sent to your mobile, but can't reply using the watch. It also has the ability to let you reject calls (but not answer them). It has a stopwatch, timer and alarm. I am very happy with the quality of this watch.",
            "Not the best but great. I find the size being the down side because it's designed to fit both male and female. It really doesn't and especially you're a more slim or petit female it really wouldn't fit nicely. The watch face part and where it bends over your wrist is too long. So if you have thick bone or thick wrist it's great. Otherwise it's not.",
            "While it's pretty and comfortable... it doesn't work accurately at all. Measured against medical equipment often, the data was wildly off. According to the watch I was at 81% oxygen in my blood... official testing at the time said 99%, that quite the difference. Watch said my heartrate was 105, medical testing said 62... another huge difference. Said I was asleep an hour before I even tried to get to sleep. There is no point to buying this for health monitoring. It's just a pretty watch.",
            "Huawei has done justice to this product. it does what it say from monitoring heart rate, sleep and distance etc.the most what I liked its the battery life. it gave me 6 days on a full charge. I have Samsung Gear 2 which only lasted a day, with notification may be half day. I got 6 days with notifications which is very impressive.I would have given a 5 star rating but the charging of the band is not as per the description, it has a separate charger, I would have like if it was like Band 4 - USB type as it would be easier to charge if battery goes low at work.apart from that I would recommend this band any time. its the best on the market at very good price.",
            "I've been using it for about 1 week and overall it was a good buy for an entry-level health band.  It does lack some of the key features of the more expensive alternatives.Pros:-Has 24hr heart rate monitor (simpler version) and customisable-SPO2 measurement-A reasonably detailed sleep tracker-Integrated GPS-Aesthetically pleasingCons:-The heart monitor doesn't have heart rate variability (HRV) which is used to measure stress levels. If that's important to you, don't buy it.-Integrated GPS uses a lot of battery. If you have 24/7 Heart rate turned on and GPS and notifications, the battery will last 3 days max.-requires wifi for the app to analyse the data which is strange? (not sure if this is standard)-There may be a privacy issue given it requires wifi when it probably shouldn't.So if you just want to try a health band this is a good buy but if you are serious about detailed measurement to improve your health or monitor your condition, this is not the right item for you, go for a 200+ dollar smartwatch.",
            "I have waited 1 month before reviewing this product,For the price this is an amazing product, i get around 10-12 days battery life with this watch (amazing).The USB charging is a great idea, no need to buy anything additional.I have a large hand, so it looks nice and small for my hand. However those with a small hand may find it slightly bulky.Great Buy 100% Recommend",
            "I have another Huawei watch (man size) which I received when I bought my phone.  Love that one but it is big and a bit heavy.  This one is so much lighter and with more features and is so much more comfortable for sleep tracking.  Can hardly wait until I can buy a Velcro band for it but the silicon one is quite comfortable for the moment.",
            "HUAWEI Band 4 Pro, Built-in GPS, Workout Guidance - Pink GoldI deliberated for a while about getting a fitness tracker for running. I wanted to be able to see my route with a reliable GPS, heart rate monitor and sleep analysis. It was very easy to set up following the instructions. There is a detailed manual under the help menu on the app. I was very impressed with the GPS. Selected outdoor run and it locked onto me in 3 seconds and then mapped the route perfectly. Great post run analytics with graphs of heart rate, pace and cadence that overlay each other as an option. Tried the option for outdoor walk for mowing the lawn but this didn't work so well (the map was out a bit) but I didn't really expect it to. Some options are listed on the app but not part of the device (e.g., climbing of stairs, stress). The sleep measure is perhaps a little inaccurate saying I'm dreaming when I'm actually still getting back to sleep. The app gives handy tips though for improving sleep quality. Lastly, the look of it is really stylish. I have a narrow wrist and was worried it would look bulky but it has heaps of holes in the band so fits perfectly and I've had lots of comments on how good it looks.",
            "I was looking for a watch with some basic functions of my exercise needs. I did quite a few researches on Fitbit, Garmin and then finally selected this one. This watch covers most of the functions that other types of watch got: heart rate, oxygen rate, types of workout and even message review function.  i have an iphone, and i can still receiving phone calls from this watch and decline the phone call. Will try the GPS function for the outdoor running. but definitely, this watch is very recommended to buy.",
            "I got my Huawei Band Pro 4 exactly one week ago. During this week, I was trying a little bit of everything. It has a nice design, it\u2019s easy to navigate, the app also has no secrets, the display is also good, GPS track also worked very well, and the sleep monitoring is very interesting with good suggestions to improve the quality of sleep.However, I am disappointed about the battery, which I had to charge FOUR TIMES in one week. I understand that using some tools would require a bit more of my battery, but I used my GPS only once in a 3 hours bike ride, I turned of notifications ao notifications, checked oxygen levels only twice and other than that I used it only to check the hours. I would understand if I had to charge it twice during this week because of the 3 hours activity with GPS, but no 4 times. That\u2019s too much.Another thing that I didn\u2019t like, but no really relevant, is that I have only 3 options for the background of its screen.",
            "Love the features and different workout features available in this band and the price is really good. Very sleak, stylish and a true work-out companion. Seamless connectivity with both iOs and Android. However, please download the latest version of Huawei Health App from Huawei App Gallery.",
            "The phone interface is easy to use and efficient. It connects through bluetooth and doesn't require the internet to transfer data. The many free watch faces are attractive and there is something to suit everyone. I have mine synced to my Huawei phone and all notifications come through the watch. It's so good for the price!",
            "I just got it and so disappointing with the battery life. I  am just using this watch because my skin seems to be ok with it. I am yet to experience skin burns like my previous watch. This seems to be the only advantage.For a watch cost almost 100$, i never expected the battery life to be such a disaster.",
            "I use it a few times a week and the battery lasts and lasts. I only count steps, distance walked and heart beats per minute but I am sure I will start to use the few other features it has. You do need a magnifying glass to read it whilst out and about. The app on my phone works OK.",
            "Never thought of using huawei but give it a try, you wont regret it.Battery last 7days with 10% leftScreen is great, quality band, tracking is spot on, sleep track does what its meant too.I've compared them all and the only comes close is fitbit.",
            "Great watch! Was a little tricky figuring out the apps and setting it up, but eventually got there. Was a great gift for my sister. The band 4 wasn't listed on the device list of bluetooth when setting up, I'm still not sure why it eventually worked, but it did! An hour later :)",
            "Would not fit band to small! Mighty ape your supplier will not accept return as package has been opened . Not impressed!",
            "I think this is a great prodcut but be aware, if you register the app with a non-chinese mobile phone, you won't get the watch face store",
            "Nothing to dislike, works as well as could be wished and the SpO2 feature is a pleasant bonus. The battery life is surprisingly good, 5 or 6 days, even with the Heart rate monitor running all day."

            "The price was competitive, delivery took just 2days without fail. Most of things were better than expected. Just one thing I never know before purchasing this, this one doesn't support Korean language at all unbelievably. What I have found out it is Garmin's marketing strategy to sell differently it as per reason. If I had known this earlier, I would have never bought this relatively expensive this with giving up smart watch function(I cannot read any Korean notification).If anybody(including seller)know the way to add Korean font into my device, please let me know that. I will be more than happy to pay for that.Again, it is strongly recommendable, satisfied if you are only English user, in every aspects apart from the language issue.",
            "The big decision for me was what size to get as I have 165mm wrists. After reading all the forums I decided on the 6 Pro (medium). I realised I wanted a sports watch that I could read easily with a good battery life. At the time of purchase it was below $500 which made it all the more attractive when compared to the 6s that was $750 at the time.  With regards to the size and weight, I personally have no issues with it and have included a pic to show the size. I bought some screen protectors from Amazon at the time of purchase and fitted one straight away so now it is like a Sapphire!",
            "Tried the Fenix 6 Pro after previously being a forerunner user and wasn't disappointed. From the music, app, battery life, stats this is a solid watch.I feel though the features are a bit much if you are just using it for running and the weight is on the heavy side. That aside happy to have bought.",

            "Great watch, has everything you need in tracking your days activities.Might take a few days to learn the main features but YouTube has many good video tips to help",
            "Built for a purpose and delivers.Still on  a steep learning curve.This is no pretty boy, pretent smart watch.Its a workhorse.Want to go hiking? Running, swimming, it will track it all for you with horsepower to spare.",
            "Watch has all the features I required plus more that I will probably never use. Fantastic build quality and very comfortable to wear.",

ECG and AFIB was my only reason to forking up all this money.Thankfully Amazon has an amazing return policy and I will definitely be returning this.",
            "Very unhappy as this watch will not support it primary feature in Australia. The advanced heart rate sensor is disabled. Apparently this is made very clear once you open the box. This should be made more clear, even when I was in a local shop, it was sold to me as having ecg capability. This is my last fitbit.",
            "The first observation of this product was the extremely inaccurate HR measurements, especially on high-intensity activities. It was showing 80-90 BMP when I was at max cardio cycle with the expected 140-150 BMP. This was eventually causing inaccurate calorie counts, making the whole health monitoring concept meaningless. I was getting more reliable data from my Ionic, so I had to switch back to it.Very disappointing.",
