            "Overall this is a great fitness watch.  It has a range of activies to choose from including run, walk, strength, cardio, (pool) swim (I think you'd need a higher spec for ocean swim), yoga, pilates and many more!It's easy to access all the menus using buttons on the side of the watch or swiping the watch face.The watch links seemlessly to your smartphone via the Garmin Connect app where you can upload all of your workouts and monitor progress at a glance.  You can track your goals, monitor heartrate and stress levels and you can even sign up for a personlised coach to take you to your first 5km, 10km or half marathon.The watch is lightweight and looks good enough that you could wear it all day.  It has a range of features designed to negate the need for carrying cards/ phone, like Garmin Pay - add bank cards to the Garmin Connect app and away you go!The watch also has the capacity to upload about 500 songs using Spotify, Amazon or other music apps and listen to them via bluetooth headphones. With phones getting bigger & heavier, who wants to carry them on your walk / run??The main reason I gave it 4 stars, not 5 was due to how hard it was to sort out the music.After synching my Spotify playlist + bluetooth headphones, I did a trial and every time I started the running app, my headphones disconnected!  After about 20 attempts and a lot of Google searching, I was able to remedy the issue, but it involved a full reset.  GRR!In my case it's because the headphones actually have a heartrate monitor in them and this was interfering with the watch's HRM.  If you have standard bluetooth earbuds, you might not have this issue.Now that I've got everything working, it really is a great watch that I enjoy using and I would highly recommend it.The price point makes it a lot more affordable than some other smart watches with similar features.",
            "Beautiful looking display, but boy where's the rest of it? There's a 3mm ring of black nothing around the tiny 31mm display wasted. My old Ticwatch E (on the left in photo) is the same size watch, but it's display is much bigger.I haven't used much of the software yet, but I'm not mad on the GUI (Graphical User Interface). Thinking of returning it due to the display. Doesn't connect to my Oppo Find X2 Pro either.",
            "The watch gives enough data with much better accuracy to track my daily activities and health status. The stress, sleep, and heart metrics have a higher accuracy rate.  It gives you the trend which can be interpreted according to individual.The battery life is awesome. I charge only once a week.Garmin Connect app could have a bit better.Overall this is a perfect daily use alternate smartwatch for Apple & FitBit. I loved it.",
            "I bought this to monitor my sleep apart from normal activities, after a month use, I can recommend it to others. Initially, the body battery was going a bit unusual but it improved itself with time. Watch size is good for thin wrists as well. In Australia, the product price was too much so I bought it from Amazon Uk with a very competitive price, but I had to wait for a couple of week for the delivery, so be ready to wait a long time if you order from outside Australia. Lastly, the battery life is around 5-6 days, but if you use it to listen to music then get ready to charge it frequently. Overall a very good fitness watch.",
            "Functions well (3rd day), power runs down quicker than expected, but probably would last six days, if not using it.  If you don't look at the screen the power will last longer.  Easily connected with my phone.  I was able to connect with my speed/cadence on my bike with no problems.  Also used in the pool for swimming.",
            "Really think that Garmin has a good product in the Venu.  I understand the battery life has also been improved on the Venu 2 - which from my perspective in using the Venu now for a few weeks is a necessary thing!  Love the music and Pay functions but have reservations with use of the Golf function.  This is perhaps the only let down point as the Golf shot tracking is overly sensitive and logs shots of 0 metres on just about every hole.  These can be deleted later on with editing - but as I'm tracking shots and club distances - this is now impacting on accuracy of measurements.  Hope this can be fixed with software tweak??  Garmin??  Other than this \"First World\" issue - a great all around activity tracking smart watch!",
            "I had a Fitbit before this. Sleep monitoring is terrible in comparison - no idea when I\u2019m awake vs light sleep. I\u2019ll need to read instructions to do anything other than view data, it\u2019s not especially intuitive. GPS takes a while to load before exercise and today it didn\u2019t even know where I was, came up with a route I didn\u2019t take! I suspect distance, pace, steps and VO2max more accurate than FitBit though - they are more conservative. Not unhappy with it, but not as happy as I expected to be \u2018upgrading\u2019 from a 3-4 year old Fitbit.",
            "I wanted to love this watch as I was upgrading from a previous model. However I ended up getting a faulty unit because whenever I charged the watch as soon as it came off the charger it went dead. Every single time. It would then take me 20-30 minutes of trying multiple reset to get it to turn back on. I put up with it for almost a month until I finally have up and sent it back.",
            "I am an ex Samsung Smart watch user. I recently switched to Garmin after my Samsung died out.  I bought this watch 1 and half week ago. I charged the watch as soon as I received it.  After fully charged the battery lasted for 7 days.  Compare this to the Samsung watch which needed charging every single day. The watch does everything a smart watch does and I am very pleased with it.I am in love with my new watch.",
            "Have been using this Venu SQ Garmin for the last 3 months - it is an awesome health and fitness tracker but I do feel it can improve slightly on tracking sleep - but everything else is really great!",
            "I have moved from a fairly simple Fitbit Charge 2 watch to this one, so I had great expectations. Being a golfer the golf app was something I was keen to use and was not disappointed. I am just starting to get a full understanding of how this watch works, but for now I'm very happy with it.",
            "I bought this watch to replace a Samsung Active2 watch. The Samsung was very stylish but HR was inaccurate and it doesn't measure spo2. The Garmin has worked perfectly. The app is not as good as STEALTH, but overall I much prefer the Garmin.",
            "The watch was really good but the screen stopped working in less than a month. Had to return it and buy a another one.",
            "We bough this for my boss who has increased her fitness last year for her to track her workouts and reach her goals.  She absolutely loves it and recommends it to anyone looking for a product like this.",
            "Brought it as a birthday present my wife loves the look and functionality and know doesn't know what it was like with out it.",
            "I love my new watch. It provides me with all I data I need to track my goals, gains and health. Excellent cost vs benefits.",
            "Looks great and my husbands now has no reason to complain that he is tired as watch shows \u2018sleep scores\u2019. Pretty amazing.",
            "Bought the  Garmin for my wife.. We both had Polar sport watches, which kept failing to charge..My wife loves her new Garmin.  No complaints at all. !",
            "It does everything as advertised. Great for the price. The OLED screen is nice. Battery lasts about two days.",
            "Looks good on the website site but the software is like a toy watch. Disappointed purchase.",
            "bought for my better half for Christmas, she has nothing but praise, cannot fault it.",
            "It's amazing very happy.",
            "Wonderful product and very accurate description",
            "buttons would not work!!!!",
            "no",
            "Value for money. Working excellent",
            "I owned several watches and this is my favourite. I owned a FitBit, a Polar Ignite an Apple Watch Series 3 and now this.This Garmin is a fitness tracker with some smart watch features. It does what a fitness tracker tends to do, i.e., track steps, heart rate, distance travelled and has GPS so you don\u2019t need to bring the phone with you. It has some extra tracking features like stress tracking and period tracking. I am going to make a quick comparison with the other watches.Sleep tracking. For me the FitBit, Apple Watch and Polar Ignite all had better sleep tracking. The Garmin Venu SQ has issues with detecting when you wake up and when you fall asleep. There was a night where I got up for a few minutes and the Garmin did not register that as being awake. It might be a fit issue as sometimes it\u2019s more accurate than others.So Garmin Venu Sq loses on the sleep tracking.Sport Tracking.It\u2019s almost on par with the Ignite. You can view your training load with the Ignite (on the Polar website), whereas with the Garmin you can\u2019t. Although it shows you your weekly average of activity, albeit it isn\u2019t quite the same thing. Garmin has a few built-in walking/running/cycling challenges, akin to those of Strava, which the Ignite does not have. I haven\u2019t used the coaching features on the watches so I can\u2019t comment as I find them limiting and they are good for generic strength training or running. I follow my own programs.The Garmin app lets you make a note of exercises and reps, although if an exercise is missing you can\u2019t add it to the app.The Garmin app notifies you with insights, like how many times you have hit your step goal, and it has a function to increase it automatically if you wish to. It also gives you badges for hitting activity milestones, which is more similar to what the Apple Watch does. They both attempt to gamify exercise somewhat whereas the Polar is serious business. The FitBit has activity and step tracking, but trying to view your routes is hidden behind a subscription. For the other Watches you don\u2019t pay any extra for this.The Apple Watch default fitness app lets you track distance, steps, heart rate like the other watches and also offers trend insights. No built-in training load like this Garmin.Garmin Venu SW sport tracking is pretty good. It depends on what you look for in your sport tracking, but if training load is essential (without having to pay for third party apps), then the Ignite just inches ahead.\u201cHealth Tracking\u201dI put it in quotes because all these watch companies add these features and then say they are not health features. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) tracking is done differently on all these devices.I prefer the Garmin and the Polar way. Polar tracks your HRV overnight and tells you if you are recovered the next day (together with sleep data). Garmin does it throughout the day, through a system called Body Battery. It uses HRV with other information to tell you whether you are stressed (physiologically or mentally) or whether you are resting during the day. It was able to detect when I was highly stressed after an argument and even sent me an alert in that case. It makes you aware of correlations between how you feel and what you did that might have caused it.For example, I had an ice cream fairly late in the evening. I thought I slept okay because I didn\u2019t remember waking up but I didn\u2019t feel rested. When I looked at the Body Battery I noticed that it wasn\u2019t until 3/4 am that my body had actually started recovering. Given that I didn\u2019t fall asleep any later than usual I wouldn\u2019t have made the connection with the ice cream, but we ain\u2019t having that in the evening anymore.HRV tracking on the FitBit requires subscription.HRV Tracking on the Apple Watch is not reliable. It tries to take readings when it sees you are relaxed or sleeping, an they are very short samples. With 3rd party apps and the use of Apple\u2019s own Breathe app you can force readings and analyse them properly, but the Apple Watch at the moment is just a bit lacklustre in this department.So for HRV Polar and Garmin are a tie and the approach you have to HRV will be the deciding factor on who wins.Cycle tracking. They all do it quite well aside from the Ignite, which doesn\u2019t have it at all. It\u2019s quite a big omission for women, as it absolutely influences the way I train. It\u2019s one of the main drivers of how I feel through the month. The Garmin also lets you add some extra notes, and not just some preset symptoms. so Garmin Venu Sq wins this one.Food TrackingFitBit wins this one as it has food tracking built in.Polar Ignite does not have it at all.Both Garmin Venu Sq and Apple Watch require and integrate with third party apps. The Venu however only works with MyFitnessPal.Pulse OximetryThe Apple Watch Series 3 and the Ignite don\u2019t have it. The FitBit Versa 3 (which is of comparable price if I recall correctly) has it and so does this Garmin. That said, pulse ox on watches are unreliable, so you might as well not use it.Battery LifeFitBit and Garmin have similar battery life. Up to 5/6 days. The Ignite has around 3 1/2 and the Apple Watch Series 3 has 18 hours. I really love not having to charge my Garmin every day.Smart Watch FeaturesThe Apple Watch here wins by a mile. Many apps, granular control over notifications, Siri.Fitbit depends on what you buy, but even the cheap FitBits let you choose which app can send notifications to your phone. I haven\u2019t seen the FitBit app store but I hear it has a limited amount of apps.Garmin Venu Sq has the ability to choose between phone notifications, message notifications and app notifications, but you can\u2019t choose which apps. You can also turn off notifications during activity. It has access to a store but like the FitBit it has limited apps.The Ignite is only a sport watch. No apps and notifications are an all or nothing affair.ScreenI didn\u2019t own a comparable FitBit so I can\u2019t comment. The Apple Watch Screen is my favourite. The Garmin\u2019s screen is decent but smaller. I really do not like the Ignite\u2019s screen, it\u2019s not very responsive.CONCLUSIONSo all in all, the Garmin Venu Sq is a jack of all trade watch that does most things decently and some quite well. The only other watch that has better flexibility is the Apple Watch Series 3, which is slightly more expensive and  has worse battery life. If you don\u2019t have an iPhone the Apple Watch is out of the equation.Given it\u2019s all around capabilities, how good Body Battery is, how the app presents the information in a way that is easy to make correlations and the longer battery life, the Garmin Venu Sq is my choice at this price range and I recommend it. Whilst the FitBit has good \u201chealth\u201d tracking capabilities you have to pay extra for things like HRV tracking, so again the Garmin wins here.",
            "Moin!=========Update=========Soooooo. Wir zwei haben nun eine ganze Weile miteinander verbracht. Sonst habe ich sehr gern meine Samsung Galaxy Watch getragen. Und? Ich habe mehrere Monate komplett drauf verzichtet. Das lag vor allem aber daran, dass mir der Smartwatch-Anteil eine lange Zeit nicht fehlte. Da \u00fcberwog einfach der Wunsch nach einem Fitnesstracker. Der Bereich ist hier f\u00fcr mich auch weiterhin einfach \u00fcberragend. Der Plan zum Joggen passt sich immer wieder individuell an und ist h\u00f6flich zu mir, wenn mich dann doch mal \u00fcber Wochen die Faulheit am Sofa festh\u00e4lt. Erstaunlicherweise funktioniert das Tracken hier tadellos und irgendwie scheinen die Satelliten sonst einen relativ gro\u00dfen Bogen um unser Gebiet zu machen. \ud83d\ude09 Zwischenzeitlich war ich f\u00fcr einige Wochen zu meiner Galaxy Watch zur\u00fcckgekehrt. Warum? Hier ist einfach das Aufladen zu nervig. Man muss dies zwar selten machen, muss dann aber bei bedarf ein Kabel an der R\u00fcckseite reinfriemeln, welches in meinen Augen dazu viel zu kurz ist. Jedes Mal krieche ich daf\u00fcr halb hinters Sofa, da es auf der Armlehne nicht liegen bleiben m\u00f6chte. Mittlerweile bin ich wieder bei der Garmin, das Wetter passt und der Bewegungsdrang ist wieder da.Wer keine Smartwatch sucht, sondern einen Fitnesstracker, der ist hier absolut richtig! Auch nach l\u00e4ngerer Nutzung und so einigen Updates w\u00fcrde ich diese Uhr noch immer nicht als Smartwatch bezeichnen. Nicht sehr smart aber viel watch und noch mehr Fitnesstracker.Urspr\u00fcngliche Rezension:Dies ist nicht meine erste Smartwatch. Recht zu Beginn bin ich 2014 mit der Moto360 von Motorola eingestiegen und dann 2016 auf die Moto360 2nd Gen. umgestiegen. Bei der Motorola war ich von Beginn an sehr begeistert vom Betriebssystem. Die Uhr war zwar nicht sehr eigenst\u00e4ndig, hat jedoch alles gespiegelt, was auf dem Handy passierte. Nur leider hat Motorola nie ein sch\u00f6nes Design geschaffen und so bin ich dann 2018 auf die Samsung Galaxy Watch umgestiegen. Hier gabs dann eine wirklich gro\u00dfartige Optik, aber eine sehr begrenzte Funktionalit\u00e4t als Spiegel des Handys. Die Abteilung Sport war bei der Galaxy Watch schon recht ausgepr\u00e4gt, nur leider hatte die Uhr bei mir beim Joggen immer Probleme mit dem GPS. Und nun? Eine Smartwatch von Garmin, die schon in der Werbung ein brillantes Display verspricht und noch dazu aussieht wie eine normale Uhr? Na dann mal los! \ud83d\ude09Diese Rezension wird vorlaufend weiterentwickelt, da die Uhr erst mit der Zeit zeigen wird, was sie alles kann.=========Design=========Die Uhr hat ein recht schlichtes Design und erinnert mich stark an die Samsung Galaxy Watch. Sie besteht komplett aus Plastik und hat eine optisch abgesetzte L\u00fcnette. Das Display ist leicht erhaben, was in meinen Augen der Garant daf\u00fcr ist, dass man damit fr\u00fcher oder sp\u00e4ter irgendwo h\u00e4ngen bleibt und so ein Sprung droht. Ich habe mir jedoch bereits eine Schutzfolie bestellt und hoffe, dass so Schlimmeres verhindert wird. Das mitgelieferte Armband ist aus Gummi und riecht recht stark, l\u00e4sst sich jedoch sehr simpel gegen ein anderes Armband tauschen. Rechts am Geh\u00e4use befinden sich zwei Kn\u00f6pfe.Im Vergleich zu anderen Smartwatches ist dieses Model doch recht leicht.=========Features=========Direkt von Anfang an zeigt sich, wof\u00fcr diese Uhr eigentlich gedacht ist. F\u00fcr mich zeigt sich diese Smartwatch weniger als Smartwatch, denn eher als Fitnesstracker. Es mag sein, dass ich in den Einstellungen noch nicht das Richtige gefunden habe, aber die Benachrichtigung vom Handy funktioniert entweder stark verz\u00f6gert oder gar nicht.-Wecker \u2013 Ich habe einen leichten Schlaf und habe mich bei meiner Galaxy Watch daran gew\u00f6hnt, mich lediglich mittels Vibrationsalarm morgens wecken zu lassen. Dies funktioniert auch mit diesem Model wirklich gro\u00dfartig.-Werte im Alltag checken \u2013 Die Uhr konzentriert sich den ganzen Tag auf meine Bewegungsabl\u00e4ufe, Puls, gelaufene Schritte und lustigerweise auch mein Stresslevel. Erstaunlicherweise macht sie das auch wirklich gut. So bekam ich in einer mehr als nervenaufreibenden Vorlesung pl\u00f6tzlich die Info \u201eIhr Stresslevel ist zu hoch\u201c. Das spiegelte in dem Moment genau mein Gef\u00fchl wieder! \ud83d\ude09-Sport \u2013 Das werde ich die Tage auf jeden Fall testen. Bei schlechtem Wetter finde ich einfach zu viele Ausreden.=========Funktionalit\u00e4t=========Der Akku macht bislang einen sehr guten Eindruck. Nicht wie bei anderen Smartwatches, muss diese Uhr nicht jeden Abend auf die Station. Da sind wir aber schon bei einem Problem. Statt die Uhr einfach auf eine Ladestation zu legen, darf man bei diesem Ger\u00e4t einen Stecker in die Uhr frickeln, in meinen Augen nicht sehr zeitgem\u00e4\u00df, das geht auf jeden Fall besser!Des Weiteren zeigt diese Uhr teilweise eine doch recht schwache Performance.  Die Smartwatch verliert immer wieder die Verbindung zum Handy oder es wird mir auf dem Handy eine Fehlermeldung angezeigt, dass die Android Benachrichtigung beendet wurde, was jedes Mal den Neustart meines Handys verlangt. Auch scheint der RAM-Speicher bei dieser Uhr nicht ausreichend zu sein, so wirkt die Bedienung oft ruckelig und es treten Latenzprobleme auf. Das Touchdisplay ist nicht sehr sensibel und so darf man \u00f6fter mehrmals wischen, ehe man das gew\u00fcnschte Ergebnis erzielt. Ein kleiner Tipp am Rande. Nicht die App \u201eSleep with Android\u201c runterladen. Bei dieser App st\u00fcrzt bei mir die Uhr jedes Mal ab und w\u00fcnscht einen Neustart.Alles in Allem ist die Men\u00fcf\u00fchrung nicht sehr intuitiv, nicht innovativ und arg ruckelig. Die Smartwatch l\u00e4uft ordentlich, da ist jedoch noch sehr viel Luft nach Oben.Ich hoffe, meine Rezension war Ihnen behilflich. \ud83d\ude0a Vielen Dank f\u00fcr's Lesen.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0Questa \u00e8 la mia prima esperienza con Garmin, ho avuto in passato sempre altri smart e sportwatch, (fitbit, huawei, huami, amazfit e xiaomi) e questo Venu SQ \u00e8 stata una bella sorpresa.Avevo bisogno di un prodotto che monitorasse la corsa in modo efficace e questo smartwatch \u00e8 perfetto sotto ogni punto di vista senza dover spendere un capitale. Premetto quindi che questa mia recensione tiene in considerazione solo la corsa e non gli altri sport.Elencher\u00f2 in modo sintetico cosa mi \u00e8 piaciuto e cosa no:\u2705 E' molto elegante, abbastanza discreto, sta bene su qualsiasi polso ed \u00e8 talmente leggero che non ci si accorge di averlo al polso. Utilizzato anche per dormire non da assolutamente fastidio.\u2705 Il display sfrutta la tecnologia LCD, ha una risoluzione di 240x240 px e non ha always on. Pensavo che questo sarebbe stato un problema ed invece lo schermo si vede benissimo in qualsiasi condizione, sembra di avere uno schermo oled, e la gesture per l'attivazione dello schermo \u00e8 precisa, non sbaglia mai un colpo, veramente ottimo !!! Anche se lo schermo \u00e8 piccolo rispetto ad altri smartwatch che ho avuto in passato si vede tutto benissimo.\u2705 Il sensore cardio \u00e8 molto preciso e legge in modo veloce le variazioni, cosa estremamente utile nello sport. E' possibile impostare una lettura H24 con modalit\u00e0 intelligente oppure continua (ogni secondo). Queste impostazioni possono essere settate o da app oppure direttamente nell'orologio. E' possibile impostare degli avvisi di frequenza alta o bassa durante l'attivit\u00e0 e anche durante la giornata intera. E' possibile disattivare il monitoraggio cardio H24.\u2705 Ha lettura dell'ossigenazione del sangue, SpO2, che pu\u00f2 essere monitorata durante tutta la giornata oppure solo durante il sonno, oppure pu\u00f2 essere disattivata e quindi la lettura pu\u00f2 essere effettuata manualmente.\u2705 Il sensore GPS e veloce e preciso. Si pu\u00f2 scegliere solo GPS, GPS + Glonass oppure GPS + Galileo. Tramite queste opzioni la triangolazione e quindi la traccia ottenuta \u00e8 precisa e l'aggancio al satellite avviene in max 7 secondi.\u2705 Il monitoraggio della corsa \u00e8 pressoch\u00e9 perfetto. Vi sono moltissime opzioni e parametri, \u00e8 possibile aggiungere dei campi dati alla corsa, ogni schermata pu\u00f2 essere modificata con i dati a proprio piacimento, c'\u00e8 l'auto pausa, a corsa avviata \u00e8 possibile modificare determinati parametri, insomma c'\u00e8 tutto l'occorrente per anche il pi\u00f9 esigente degli utenti. Fantastico !\u2705 E' presente anche un sistema di sicurezza di rilevazione incidenti, quindi se avviene una caduta viene mandato un messaggio di emergenza con la posizione GPS a determinati contatti preimpostati nell'app sul telefono. Ovvio che per usufruire di questa opzione \u00e8 necessario avere con se il telefono.\u2705 E' possibile avviare un live track dell'attivit\u00e0 sportiva svolta e condividerla con i propri contatti. In questo modo da remoto il vostro contatto potr\u00e0 visualizzare in tempo reale la vostra attivit\u00e0. Anche in questo caso \u00e8 necessario avere con se il telefono.\u2705 Finalmente uno smartwatch che opera veramente in multitasking. Se fate partire un'attivit\u00e0, tramite swipe a sisnitra, potrete tornare alla home e da li avere accesso a tutto i parametri, widget, app, ecc. dello smartwatch. La vostra attivit\u00e0 rimarr\u00e0 attiva in background. Potete inoltre ricevere anche ad attivit\u00e0 avviata tutte le notifiche, impostazione settabile a proprio piacimento.\u2705 Cosa da non sottovalutare, questo smartwatch \u00e8 affidabile ! Il software non si incarta, non lagga, il sistema operativo \u00e8 ben studiato, funziona tutto alla grande.\u2705 Il punto forte di questo e di tutti i prodotti garmin \u00e8 il software. Il migliore fino ad ora provato ! Garmin Connect gestisce in modo perfetto il sync tra orologio e telefono. Notifiche puntuali e precise, tra l'altro \u00e8 possibile rispondere direttamente da orologio tramite messaggi preimpostati, e sync perfetto. L'app \u00e8 veramente completa e ben fatta. E' possibile tramite garmin coach, avere degli allenamenti preimpostati oppure crearne nuovi a proprie esigenze. E' una funziona che non ho testato benissimo, ma \u00e8 un valore aggiunto di non poco conto. Per aggiungere ulteriori funzionalit\u00e0 allo smartwatch, app, widget campi dati e watchface, bisogna scaricare un'altra app, uno store ogni giorno sempre pi\u00f9 aggiornato chiamato Connect IQ, dalla quale \u00e8 possibile aggiungere app e widget allo smartwatch, aggiungere e modificare watchface. Insomma, oltre ad avere un ottimo prodotto al polso \u00e8 fondamentale avere un ottimo software a supporto e a mio avviso da questo punto di vista Garmin non ha rivali.\u2705 Durante la giornata viene monitorato lo stress e quindi viene calcolato il body battery, ovvero un'indicazione della carica energetica del vostro corpo, veramente utile per trovare il miglior periodo della giornata per effettuare un'attivit\u00e0. E' una funzione molto valida e utile, e funziona alla grande !!\u2705 E possibile controllare qualsiasi lettore audio in esecuzione sul telefono, quindi si pu\u00f2 alzare il volume, play / pausa  e skip dei pezzi.\u2705 E' presente Garmin Pay, quindi associata la vostra carta di credito, potrete in tutta sicurezza effettuare pagamenti con il vostro smartwatch sfruttando la funzione contactless (NFC) integrata. Dovrete impostare una passkey che dovrete quindi inserire prima di effettuare il pagamento. Il sistema \u00e8 super sicuro e funziona alla perfezione.\u2705 E' possibile settare sveglie, timer, aumentare o abbassare la luminosit\u00e0 automatica su 3 livelli (c'\u00e8 un sensore automatico della luminosit\u00e0 che lavora in modo estremamente efficace e veloce), \u00e8 possibile disattivare il Bluetooth (cosa non presente su nessun smartwatch che fino ad ora ho provato), ricercare il telefono e tutte le maggiori funzioni presenti in tutti questi device. E' possibile rispondere e/o rifiutare le chiamate in arrivo.\u2705 Il monitoraggio del sonno \u00e8 preciso, vengono calcolati parametri quali sonno profondo, leggero e rem. Viene inoltre calcolato il numero delle volte che si respira ogni minuto (anche di giorno questo avviene), e quanto ci si muove nel letto. Unito al monitoraggio cardio e  dello stress si ha un quadro davvero completo del proprio sonno, molto utile dopo un'attivit\u00e0 o durante un periodo di allenamento intensivo.\u2705 Ogni singola opzione, ad esempio gli avvisi cardio o altre impostazioni  sono attivabili sia dall'app del telefono che direttamente sullo smartwatch. E' possibile inoltre collegare, quindi fare sync e impostare vari settaggi, lo smartwatch al proprio PC, Win e Mac, tramite l'app Garmin Express.\u2705 Se siete super smanettoni Garmin mette a disposizione il pacchetto SDK per poter sviluppare tramite linguaggio prioritario, praticamente simile al C, app, widget, watchface in ambiente Clipper. C'\u00e8 una community molto attiva in tal senso e quindi se vorrete cimentarvi alla creazione troverete un valido supporto e valida documentazione.  La possibilit\u00e0 quindi di poter collegare lo smartwatch al PC \u00e8 fondamentale ed estremamente utile per testare le vostre creazioni, app, watchfaces o widget.\u2705 L'autonomia \u00e8 quella dichiarata. Senza attivit\u00e0 sportiva e quindi solo con notifiche, monitoraggio cardio H24 in modalit\u00e0 smart e senza SpO2 si fanno 6 giorni e mezzo. Con due attivit\u00e0 di 1 ora si arriva a fare 5 giorni. Dipende poi dall'utilizzo, dalla watchface utilizzata (alcune hanno attivit\u00e0 in bagkround che consumano di pi\u00f9). Il calcolo pi\u00f9 o meno \u00e8 un 10% circa di consumo con attivit\u00e0 e opzione GPS+Galileo (solo GPS consuma un 2/3% in meno), e con un'utilizzo medio / intenso il consumo a giornata, incluso sonno, \u00e8 circa un 15/20% giorno (smanettamenti, installare e disinstallare app e un discreto numero di notifiche). La ricarica avviene in modo rapido, quindi in circa 45 minuti si passa da un 15% a un 85%. Insomma l'autonomia non sar\u00e0 un problema.\u2705 E' da circa 3 settimane che ho questo smartwatch ed ho gi\u00e0 ricevuto 3 aggiornamenti software. Viene aggiornato anche il software dei sensori, e del gps. Insomma supporto totale da parte di Garmin.\u2705 Ho avuto molti smartwatch in passato ed ho una discreta esperienza in merito, quindi posso affermare che questo Garmin Venu SQ \u00e8 un prodotto veramente completo sotto ogni punto di vista. Per quanto riguarda la corsa possono essere monitorati molti parametri. A primo impatto pu\u00f2 sembrare difficile e complicato la sua gestione, ci sono 2 app da mettere sul telefono,  i parametri e le opzioni che sono presenti nello smartwatch sono molti, ma dopo qualche giorno vi renderete conto che il tutto in realt\u00e0 \u00e8 molto semplice e super funzionale, molto ben progettato e studiato alla perfezione per poter venire incontro anche all'utente pi\u00f9 esigente. Per le funzionalit\u00e0 che ha e per  la fascia di prezzo che viene proposto  a mio avviso questo \u00e8 il miglior e il pi\u00f9 completo prodotto presente sul mercato !L'unica cosa che non mi \u00e8 piaciuta \u00e8 la lentezza della sincronizzazione tra smartwatch e telefono, ma \u00e8 un dettaglio altamente trascurabile.Se siete quindi alla ricerca di un dispositivo per il monitoraggio dell'attivit\u00e0 sportiva, da non spendere un capitale, questo \u00e8 lo smart/sport watch perfetto. Brava Garmin ! \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00",
            "OverviewI have long been a loyal user of running watches produced by Garmin and my most recent (and previously much loved) watch is this Garmin Vivo Active 3. I have also road tested the Polar Vantage M, the Polar Ignite recently and now this new Garmin Venu. I typically run 50km to 60km per week (combination of trails and on road) and also use the watches for multi-sports such as weight training, spinning etc. My review below contains the detail but in summary I absolutely love this watch, its functionality and its high quality screen are exactly what was needed in this now quite crowded sports/activity tracking watch area. When combined with the Garmin app you really do have a 5* product which will help with monitoring health and performance.Set Up:- You can set up the watch with or without the Garmin App. It is recommended to use the app and therefore I did (I also love analyising my fitness data so a watch which isn\u2019t syncing with an app is no fun for me).- The watch was easy to set up and both the watch and App were intuitive to use.Charging- The watch arrived with 52% battery power. It comes with a USB charger (note: no mains plug, you will either need to charge via a laptop or a mains to USB charger). The watch attaches to the charger via an each magnetic connection.- The watch went from out of box to being 100% charged in less than 1 hour (via mains).- The charger is a small clip in which attaches to the back of the watch. It attaches easily (it is the same connector as the Vivoactive, a watch with which I have had no charging mishaps in the past and therefore seems to be a robust and reliable system).Aesthetics, general wearability and day to day use- The Garmin Venu looks very good on my wrist, it is a nice size for day to day wear (it is slightly deeper than the Vivoactive 3 but the screen size is about the same size).- It is light and as a result it was easy to forget I was wearing it. It is only 46g (3g heavier than the Vivoactive 3)- The strap is soft and pliable (other running watches such as the the cheaper Polar watches have quite stiff straps).Ease of Operation:- The watch is operated largely by touch screen (there are two buttons on the side of the watch, one which starts/stops activities and can be used a a selector button, the other which is mainly used to access the main menu/settings). I really like the intuitive and easy to use touch screen ability \u2013 it feels modern and up to date but more importantly it is very quick to navigate.- To start training you select the top button on the device and then scroll to find the activity you want to start. You can set the watch up so your most frequently used activities are listed up front for a quick start. There are many pre-programmed activities but I have mainly used the running (outdoors), treadmill running, indoor cycling and strength training activities.- The activity is paused by pressing the same button and then the touch screen gives end and save options. I have found that the watch is quicker to start/stop/change activities than the Vivoactive 3 is.GPS log on- There is nothing more frustrating then your watch taking a long time to log onto the GPS signal when you just want to start running, I was concerned about this having read other reviews of this watch.- I had no siginifcant issues with the GPS link up. I have used the watch in a small town, a city, at the start of many races and in the countryside when trail running and the GPS log on was adequate in all locations (usually almost immediate but on rare and more frustrating occasions up to 1 minute).- It is worth noting that the Polar watch I have road tested often found GPS signal before the Garmin watches when I wear them side by side.Activities/Running/Distance Accuracy/GPS- As a runner this is what is most important to me.- The outdoor running accuracy appears to be incredibly good. IMy Vivoactive 3 has matched (with very small tolerances) with official race measured distances in anything from 5km to 30km races. When I tested this Venu vs the Vivoactive 3 (wearing both on the same two runs) they measured almost exactly the same.- On set up I selected automatic pause so when I stop running, for example at traffic lights, the device automatically pauses and then restarts tracking once I am running again. This feature worked well.- I like the strength training rep counter although I don\u2019t always use it (unless I am wanting to deliberately slow down my work rate)Data screens- Along side the accuracy of data the availability of data whilst running is important to me.- Each data screen can hold 4 pieces of data (e.g. pace, distance, time etc.).- You can customise what data you have via the app.- The data was easy to see whilst running and gave me the information I needed to monitor and improve my performance.Display- The display graphics on the Venu and amazing compared to the Vivoactive 3, I am hugely surprised by the improvement. I have photographed the two watches side by side, the Venu on the top is so much better than the Vivoactive 3. It also looks much more modern in terms of what is displayed on the screen, the layout etc.- I really enjoy the fact that you can customise what data you have on your standard watch screen. I have mine set up to show digital time, date and step count. It did take a bit of time to work out how to do this but worth it once you have it working in the way you want it to.Interaction with other devices and apps- In common with all runners I know I like to be able to analyse my running data and look at details such as my heart rate, pace and so on over the course of a run.- The Venu uses the Garmin Connect app to do this (note you can have more than one Garmin device paired up with the app on your phone). The watch is quick to syncronise and does this itself after activities. It can also be forced via the app.- The have my Garmin App (and therefore the watch data) also syncronised to MyFitnessPal so that my calories burnt are sent over to MFP and calories consumed are sent from MFP to the Garmin (watch and app).As a training aide- Being able to pre-program workouts before setting off makes for much easier interval training.- I use the Garmin to write a training plan with specific work-outs (e.g. interval training) and these then become available in the watch on syncing the two together.- The data you get on the watch at the end of the run is not that extensive (the Polar watch may be better for you if you want this on the watch) but the data in the app is extensive and useful for a post race or run postmortem.Battery life- The battery life on the Venu is very good, but outperformed by the Polar by about 10% when both had the same features engaged (e.g. continuous heart rate monitoring). The increased screen quality is however worth the impact on battery life!- As part of my testing I charged it up and took the Venu out for a 3 hour trail jaunt, using GPS the whole time. I came back with just under 50% battery so happy enough with that and it ties into the 6 hours of GPS usage battery claim.Garmin App- The Garmin Connect App is what takes this watch from a very good 4* product to a 5* watch for me.- It is a real life tracker. I track my weight (and my BMI which is automatically tracks), my steps, my menstrual cycle, my calories in (and out, via a link up with MFP), I analyse my run and race results, set and monitor step (and other activity) goals \u2013 I must look at the App on average 10 times per day.- The App is easy to use, intuitive and I honestly believe it has contributed to me developing an even healthier lifestyle.- The app is the reason why I can\u2019t see myself moving away from Garmin when I need my next running watch/activity tracker.- As an aside I find the 24/7 heart rate monitoring offered by Garmin devices to be incredibly helpful. I normally can work out I am going down will and illness about 12 hours before hand because of my slightly raised resting heart rate etc.Other features- The \u2018sleep\u2019 feature ion the Venu is more accurate than on the Vivoactive 3 which seems to think I\u2019m asleep from the minute I get into bed and start reading until I get up in the morning.- I had the watch paired with my phone all day via the Garmin Connect app so I could receive message etc. notifications \u2013 a useful function but it does drain the battery more quickly.In summary the Garmin Venu is an amazing watch supported by a brilliant app and I would not hesitate to recommend it.Update 9th July 2021: After almost 2 years of daily usage, this watch has suddenly encountered a problem where it no longer charges up. I've tried various cables and chargers which work fine on other Garmin watches. After contacting Garmin customer services, they immediately acknowledged the problem and will take back the watch and send a refurbished replacement. This has now been posted back now. So far, first impressions of customer service is very impressive. I will update once matter is resolved.Update 14th July 2021: The refurbished replacement has arrived today, and as far as I can see, it's a in as good as new condition everything seems to work just fine including charging! setting it up was a breeze, just sync up to your phone app and all the settings are transferred across and all ready to go with minimum fuss. Impressive customer service!",
            "Ich bin wohl einer der ersten, die diese Uhr erhalten hat und m\u00f6chte auf meine Erfahrungen mit ihr eingehen.Seit geraumer Zeit schon suche ich eine Alternative zur Apple Watch f\u00fcr Android User, vorzugsweise mit l\u00e4ngerer Akkulaufzeit.Uhren, die ich bisher besessen oder getestet habe:- Android wear von sony (genutzt)- Amazfit verge (genutzt)- Amazfit BIP S (genutzt)- Amazfit GTR 2 (getestet und zur\u00fcck geschickt)- Garmin Venu (1) (getestet und zur\u00fcck geschickt- Amazfit GTS 2 Mini (genutzt)- Garmin Vivomove Luxe (genutzt, aktuelle Uhr)Und jetzt sollte nach meiner negativen Erfahrung mit der Venu 1, die Venu 2 (als kleine S) noch einen Versuch bekommen.Die Uhr wurde auf Herz und Nieren gepr\u00fcft und hier die Pros, Cons und neutralen Punkte:Pro:- Herzfrequenzmessung ist merklich besser als die vorherige Generation von Garmin (Vivomove Luxe, Venu 1), aber nicht auf dem Level einer Apple watch. Dennoch ist die Venu 2 bisher die einzige Uhr, die HIIT einigerma\u00dfen verfolgen kann und kein Apple Logo besitzt. Deshalb gibt es hier z\u00e4hneknirschend ein Lob.- die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, auch hier gibt es ein vorsichtiges Lob, weil die Uhr immer noch recht dick ist. Trotzdem, die S Version, verglichen mit den meisten anderen Uhren sch\u00f6n klein.- die Garmin Umgebung. Also App, Einstellungen, sync M\u00f6glichkeiten, das ist schon deutlich besser als der Abklatsch von Amazfit. Man merkt auch extrem, dass sich Amazfit hier an Garmin \"orientiert\", aber es eben nicht in gleicher Qualit\u00e4t kopieren kann.- Genauigkeit der restlichen Sensoren, also GPS, Barometer etc. Scheint allesamt besser zu sein als bei der vorherigen Generation. Wobei es jetzt nicht verlgleichbar ist mit dem GPS meines OnePlus 8 Pro, aber Smartphones haben generell ein besseres GPS als Uhren. Es ist auf jeden Fall genau genug und leistet sich wenige Fehler, der Barometer im Gegensatz zur Luxe brauchbar, passt.So die neutralen Punkte:- Display. Ja, Amoled, ja endlich mit dem Glas verklebt und besser als von der Venu 1, aber ganz ehrlich, so nebeneinander ist das Display der 90 Euro \"teuren\" Amazfit GTS 2 nicht schlechter. Wenn ich jetzt entscheiden m\u00fcsste, welches subjektiv gesehen sch\u00f6ner ist, dann tendiere ich sogar zur billigen Amazfit. Bei einem Preis von 400 Euro ist das maximal ein neutral Punkt, weil ein schlechteres Display als das, w\u00e4re negativ.- Bedienung der Uhr. Die ist ok. Wischgesten werden nicht ganz zuverl\u00e4ssig erkannt, daf\u00fcr ist sie einigerma\u00dfen durchdacht. Aber auch hier bewegen wir uns nat\u00fcrlich in einem Preisbereich, in dem die Konkurrenz, nat\u00fcrlich meine ich Apple, ganz andere Ma\u00dfst\u00e4be setzt. Aber man kommt zurecht, also neutral.- Akkulaufzeit. Ja, die ist jetzt auch \"ok\". Mit Blutsauerstoffmessung \u00fcber Nacht und ab und zu GPS muss man sie sp\u00e4testens alle 3 Tage laden. Wie Garmin auf die unrealistischen Werksangaben kommt wissen nur die G\u00f6tter. Laufzeit also sehr verlgleichbar mit meiner Vivomove Luxe und damit noch ok. Dennoch muss man erw\u00e4hnen, dass eine GTS 2 Mini problemlos \u00fcber eine Woche MIT Always on Display kommt, das ist bei Garmin n\u00e4mlich nicht aktiviert, dazu komme ich bei den Cons.Cons:- Geh\u00e4usequalit\u00e4t. Ganz ehrlich, meiner Meinung nach eine Frechheit f\u00fcr das Geld. Die oben erw\u00e4hnte 90 Euro Amazfit Uhr wirkt hochwertiger, mit chinesischen Herstellern im 150\u20ac Bereich braucht die Uhr sich gar nicht versuchen zu messen. Ja etwas Metall um das Glas aber dann ist es doch ein grenzwertig verarbeiteter plastik Klotz. H\u00e4tte ich eine Alternative zur Uhr f\u00fcr Android w\u00e4re das auf jeden Fall ein Ausschlusskriterium. Garmin kann es besser, die (auch \u00fcberteuerte) Vivomove Luxe ist komplett aus Metall, sie wollen nur scheinbar nicht.- Garmins Produktpolitik. Ich mag es einfach nicht, wenn Funktionen, die die Uhr grunds\u00e4tzlich problemlos ausf\u00fchren k\u00f6nnte, der teureren Fenix vorbehalten sind. Reine Software Abgrenzungen um ein teureres Produkt zu rechtfertigen (das dann wiederum andere Dinge nicht kann). Find ich nicht gut, gibt ein con. Konkret geht es um Kartennavigation. K\u00f6nnte die Uhr, kann Garmin, aber sie macht es eben nicht.- Akkulaufzeit bei Always on display. Ja was soll ich sagen, man kann das Display zwar Always on haben, aber die Nutzbarkeit der Uhr ist damit vorbei weil sie schneller leer ist als man bis 3 z\u00e4hlen kann. Andere k\u00f6nnen das VIEL besser.- Displayr\u00e4nder und Wertigkeitseindruck. Diese beiden Punkte gehen Hand in Hand. Was unterscheidet 2021 Smartphones optisch von 2015? Genau, die Displayr\u00e4nder. Viel Rand ohne Funktion wirkt alt und in einer Uhr, auf der das Display ohnehin generell zu klein ist, ist das wichtiger als im Smartphone. Und dann kommt Garmin 2021 mit einer Uhr die Rand \u00fcber Rand hat. Damit meine ich erstmal Rand um den Bildschirm, dann nochmal die Metallumrandung, v\u00f6llig ohne Funktion, dazu. Es wirkt einfach billig, es tut weh zu sehen welche Schmuckst\u00fccke man bei Apple f\u00fcrs gleiche Geld bekommt...- Ladestecker. Ja was soll ich sagen, nichts ist nerviger als eigenartige Ladestecker die nur f\u00fcr die Uhr passen und sonst f\u00fcr nichts. Man muss immer das eine Kabel dabei haben, generell ist das eine Kabel verlegt, es ist nervig. Bei der billiguhr egal, aber eine 400\u20ac Uhr in 2021 muss drahtlos laden k\u00f6nnen. Da gibt's auch keine Diskussion. Kann sie nicht, also con.- Softwarequalit\u00e4t dieser Venu 2. Ich h\u00e4tte gro\u00dfe Probleme. Sie h\u00e4ngt sich auf, Update funktioniert nicht, Apps laden funktioniert nicht, was ich mich alleine am ersten Tag herum ge\u00e4rgert habe. Unglaublich. Ich hatte hier schon ein 1 Stern review stehen, dass ich mittlerweile korrigiert habe. Ja, ich bin einer der ersten der die Uhr gekauft hat aber das war schon unter aller Kanone.Ja was ist also das Fazit?Ich befinde mich in der dummen Situation, dass ich die Uhr wahrscheinlich behalten werde, schlichtweg weil es derzeit keine Alternativen gibt f\u00fcr Android.- Samsung hat noch schlechteren Akku und der herzfrenzsensor ist mies- Polar hat noch mehr plastik und schlechtere Messung- amazfit baut sch\u00f6ne schicke Uhren aber die Qualit\u00e4t der Sportmessungen ist unter aller Kanone bei den top Modellen, software grenzwertig- Huawei ist so ein Mittelding aus Samsung und amazfit, auch da gibt's keine Uhr die man wirklich als Alternative zur Apple watch ansehen kann- s\u00e4mtliche Android wear Uhren disqualifizieren sich durch die Akkulaufzeit und die, die es nicht tun durch Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und messungenauigkeiten.Ich f\u00fchle mich als Android Nutzer als wie der amerikanische W\u00e4hler an der Wahlurne 2016, ich habe mich f\u00fcr die Venu 2 entschieden, aber eigentlich w\u00fcnsche ich mir etwas anderes.",
            "I bought this watch as a replacement for a Vivoactive 3. I wanted a newer watch with a nicer display, and better heartrate tracking accuracy. The Vivoactive 3 was never quite amazing at tracking my heartrate through the HIIT nature of powerlifting, and I could be out of breath to the point of needing to bend over to catch my breath after a heavy set of squats and my heartrate would register 99, with the Vivoactive 3 finally registering properly when my heartrate dropped to around 130 bpm.After doing some research on other brands in case I wanted to switch (investigated Fitbit, Amazfit and others), I decided to stick with Garmin for the better battery life, GPS accuracy, body battery feature, and the fact that you can put your own music on the Venu 2/2s whereas Fitbit has removed that feature in favour of streaming only. I use YouTube music, so only supporting Spotify/Deezer on the Fitbits was no deal for me. Amazfit's heart tracking is around as accurate as my Vivoactive 3 if not worse from the reviews I watched analyzing it, so that was also a no-go.In short, the display is lovely, the built-in watch face in the photo fits my preferences perfectly so going to the Connect store for one was not necessary, and the heart rate tracking keeps up with my lifts. Instead of the watch thinking I haven't hit my intensity minutes goals, it realises I do 200-300 per week with my training.The negative reviews here are mostly strikes against the cost of this device for the tracking and accuracy of the metrics vs other cheaper Garmin devices. Remember here that you are paying premium for a nice-looking AMOLED display. If the display type doesn't bother you much, then I would recommend waiting on the Vivoactive 5. If your main activity type is running, then a Forerunner is likely a better option. However, if you're like myself and your main sport is powerlifting or another, and/or you want a beautiful, sharp display on your watch coupled with great battery life, then this is for you.",
            "Received the watch earlier than expected - great work, Amazon. The watch looks good, and the display - when it\u2019s on - is pretty. However, that may be the extent of the upside. The problem is the \u2018always on\u2019 feature, which is what persuaded me to buy the Venu rather than the Vivoactive 4 (which is identical in function). I have had several Garmin watches, and I also have an Apple Watch 3. Despite its lovely display, the fact that it goes blank and you need to move your wrist to see it made it intolerable for me. The Vivoactive 3 I replaced it with has a less pretty display, but you can always see it - and its sports features are way ahead of anything you can get on the Apple Watch. So the Venu, with an \u2018always on\u2019 OLED display, should have combined the best of both, with some functional enhancements too. But the display is very uncooperative. It decides when it\u2019s going to be on, and that often isn\u2019t what you asked it to do! It may show the power-saving \u2018always on\u2019 face (basically just the time) for some of the time, but refuse to wake up and show the full display when you move it. Or it will just be blank. And resolutely stay blank until you hit it. Hard. No amount of playing with the screen settings has resolved this behaviour. I hope a firmware update will improve it (mine is on 3.4), but as yet I can\u2019t recommend it.",
            "Als die Venu angek\u00fcndigt wurde wusste ich dass ich nicht wiederstehen konnte und von meiner Forerunner 645 Music umsteigen werde. Dank Vorbestellung von Amazon hatte ich sie schon vor Release und konnte sie schon gut testen.+Design: die Uhr wirkt sehr hochwertig, dezent und edel und kann sogar mit Silikonband zu schicken Outfits getragen werden. Die Verarbeitung l\u00e4sst wirklich nicht zu w\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig und sie l\u00e4sst sich bequem den ganzen Tag tragen+Display: f\u00fcr mich die perfekte Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und hier der erste deutliche Unterschied zur Forerunner: sehr sch\u00f6ne Farben, gestochen scharf und auch im Training immer gut ablesbar.Ich hatte etwas Bedenken wegen dem Touchscreen aber wurde \u00fcberzeugt. Es l\u00e4sst sich pr\u00e4zise navigieren, reagiert promt. Da Garmin ja ein sehr umfangreiches Men\u00fc hat, f\u00e4llt es mir mit dem Touchscreen sogar deutlich leichter.+Training: f\u00fcr mich das wichtigste denn ich suchte keine SmartWatch mit Fitnessfunktion sondern eine LAUFuhr! Denn ich laufe 5mal Pro Woche im ambitionierten Marathontraining. Hier bietet bie Venu gleiches Potential wie die Forerunner mit einigen Verbesserungen.1. Das GPS findet deutlich schneller Signal2. Der Herzfrequenz Sensor ist sehr genau und reagiert schnell auf \u00c4nderung was f\u00fcr mich im Intervall Training sehr wichtig istDie Forerunner konnte ich hier nur mit Brustgurt verwenden, bei der Venu ist die Messung am Handgelenk so exakt dass ich den Gurt immer weniger benutze.+Akku: die Uhr kam mit gut 90% Akku an, ich habe sie nicht geladen und jetzt 4 Tage benutzt. Dabei war ich drei Mal trainieren und habe nat\u00fcrlich am Anfang viel an der Uhr gespielt. Aktuell haben ich noch 26% , die Akkuleistung scheint also sogar besser als von Garmin angegeben. Ganz klar ein Plus!Ich kann bisher nichts kritisieren. Der pulsoximeter ist nett, f\u00fcr mich aber eher eine kleine Spielerei. Die Funktion mit der Body Battery ist aber toll! Ich bin sehr zufrieden",
            "I do a lot of running and wanted to be able to ditch my phone but still track my runs and listen to music. I did a lot of research before buying this watch and decided this was the best option. I got it for under \u00a3200.MUSIC: The built in Spotify app is a feature which the Apple Watch doesn't have. This is really useful and simple to sync music / podcasts (albeit note that Garmin / Spotify have a problem with syncing podcasts from BBC Sounds - I have taken this up with both of them and got a very disappointing response that they are not supported).ACTIVITIES: The Venu Sq tracks all activities. I use it to run and in the gym. It tracks my runs accurately and (once setup) links automatically to my strava. It tracks sets / reps relatively well in the gym automatically. You can amend the exercise / reps / weight in the Garmin Connect app after (although this does keep crashing when I amend the above which is annoying).PERFORMANCE: The touch screen is ok. I have always found Garmin a bit difficult to navigate. My father has a Forerunner and I struggle to use the buttons on that. But it's certainly no worse than any other Garmin.BUILD: I have scratched the side of the watch which is annoying. I have since bought a screen protector and that has helped avoid any scratches to the screen. But overall the build seems good. Put it to use; it doesn't matter if it gets a little scratched.OVERALL: Overall I'm really happy with the watch. It's great for what I wanted, i.e. to ditch my phone. I still think it's great to go out running with just my headphones and a key. The Apple Watch doesn't give you the links to Spotify. There are limited number of Garmin watches that do. This is the cheapest; but I think it does just as good a job at tracking activities as a Forerunner (not tried a Fenix).",
            "I bought this to replace my broken Fitbit charge 3. The data captured is much more useful for me to understand my body situation than my Fitbit. Charging it every day I take a shower, and it comes to 100% battery after that. Synchronization is fast and smooth (while my old charge 3 took a lot of time and sometimes not syncing for the whole day), the screen is clear to see, and the interface can be customised to very personal, friendly one.",
            "I love a good watch.I think it's fair to say I've owned a large number of watches during my life, both standard and smart. Most smartwatches come with an array of functions, most of which are useless to me. I started getting smartwatches because I kept missing calls/texts and wanted something to help with that. The vibration motor on this watch is perfect for this; it's certainly not something you'll miss when you get called etc.Last year my wife suggested that I may be suffering from sleep apnea, so I decided to see what watches were around that could help prove that. It turns out that although there are a lot of watches out there with SPO2 functionality, the majority of them don't run a continuous trace, and instead just have an on-demand check. For someone looking to monitor sleep, this is useless. So I was down to just a few watches, and the price point meant that realistically it was down to this watch and the Fitbit Versa 3.I spent weeks researching the two watches, and was almost decided on the Versa; with a slightly larger screen and AMOLED at that, it seemed a no-brainer. Until I saw some posts on the Fitbit forums where everyone was complaining that to analyse SPO2 results required a monthly fee. All the posts contained people's wish they'd gone for this watch instead. My mind was made up.So here we are.There is a lot of functionality in this watch, most of which I've not used. It seems accurate enough in my step count and can tell me how far I've walked on the off-chance I've walked anywhere.The sleep monitoring is on a par with other watches but can give me not only the information about what type of sleep I've had at various points during the night, but also how many breaths per minute I'm managing, and of course the all-important SPO2 graph.The stress monitoring I'm not totally sure about; it shows I get very little stress during the night, but it can get quite high during the working day. I do have a stressful job, but it's not something I've really thought as affecting me in any negative way. Something to keep an eye on I guess.The app (android) gives you all the information you need about all functions offered and is very easy to understand (with information pages where needed).The screen is easy to read inside and outside - I've yet to try it outside on a sunny day, but we don't get many of those and aren't allowed outside anyway. It's small though, which is a small issue for me as I wear glasses for up-close work like reading and using computers, but don't wear them otherwise; making the watch hard to see. You can change the watch face, however, and with a large selection to choose from (and the option to make your own), there's certainly something for every eye strength.It'll be hard for me to pass judgement on the battery life; for my use, it lasts 6-8 days which is great, but I do very little exercise at the moment and appreciate that the battery life will be far less if I'm running all over the shop every day.Overall, I'm really happy with this watch; the only thing I'd change would be to have a larger screen.I might keep this one the longest.",
            "Ich habe von einer Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music auf die Venu gewechselt.F\u00fcr mich war das Mip Display der Vivoactive 3 Music optisch ein Graus, hat aber seine Arbeit bei allen Lichtverh\u00e4ltnissen anstandslos getan.Da ich meine Uhr 24h trage und auch gerne zu feierlichen Anl\u00e4ssen, kommt mir die Venu mit dem Amoled Display gerade recht.Das Men\u00fc der Venu ist etwas anders aufgebaut als bei der Vivoactive, aber daf\u00fcr auch mit zwei Kn\u00f6pfen zu bedienen.Ich denke ein Knopf h\u00e4tte es hier auch getan.Habe die Uhr erst seit sechs Tagen in Gebrauch, musste sie aber auch erst zweimal laden.Dazu z\u00e4hlen 16h always on Display, st\u00e4ndiger Pulsmesser, gelegentliche Benachrichtigungen, 2,5h Indooraktivit\u00e4t ohne GPS sowie eine Outdooraktivit\u00e4t mit GPS.Das Armband der Vivoactive konnte ich wieder verwenden (20mm Stegbreite) und auch so macht die Uhr einen optisch sch\u00f6nen Eindruck.Sie liegt gut am Handgelenk und ist f\u00fcr ihr Format sehr leicht.Das Ladekabel ist mit der Vivoactive identisch.Im IQ Store findet man zur Zeit leider noch nicht so viele Watchfaces.Aber ich denke das legt sich bald.Als Umsteiger bin ich letztendlich vollkommen zufrieden, auch wenn ich bei der Ablesbarkeit in der prallen Sonne im Gegensatz zur Vivoactive Abstriche machen muss.",

Par contre elles sont \u00e9quip\u00e9es d'un vibreur tr\u00e8s efficace pour vous alerter.La finition est correcte mais les boutons en plastique et le bracelet font un peu \"cheap\". Mais, \u00e0 moins de 200\u20ac, le tarif reste imbattable par rapport aux fonctionnalit\u00e9s propos\u00e9es.La Venu 2S est une version plus \u00e9volu\u00e9e qui inclut un \u00e9cran rond AMOLED 1,2 pouce haute r\u00e9solution, un cerclage en acier inoxydable, et des animations des exercices sur l'\u00e9cran. Ce mod\u00e8le est non seulement plus qualitatif mais il est aussi plus r\u00e9actif, donc je suppose que le processeur embarqu\u00e9 dans la 2S est plus puissant.Esth\u00e9tiquement je trouve le mod\u00e8le 2S beaucoup plus r\u00e9ussi et, malgr\u00e9 une taille identique de 40mm, il apparait plus discret et plus \u00e9l\u00e9gant sur un petit poignet.Capteurs de sant\u00e9 communes aux 2 montres :Une Venu/Venu2 se porte toute la journ\u00e9e et toute la nuit, de sorte que la montre affiche les scores de vos constantes physiques. Ceci ne pose aucun probl\u00e8me vu la l\u00e9g\u00e8ret\u00e9 et l'autonomie des 2 appareils qui d\u00e9passe 5 jours sans probl\u00e8me. De plus ces deux mod\u00e8les sont \u00e9galement \u00e9tanches.Fr\u00e9quence cardiaque : mesur\u00e9e au poignet elle est tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cise sur les 2 montres. Elle peut s'afficher \u00e0 la demande ou m\u00eame appara\u00eetre en permanence sur l'\u00e9cran d'accueil (le \"cadran de montre\"). C'est le m\u00eame capteur pour les 2 appareils.Oxym\u00e8tre de pouls : mesure le taux d'oxyg\u00e8ne sanguin. Cette mesure est sensible au mouvement ou \u00e0 la position de la montre sur le poignet. Contrairement \u00e0 d'autres montres, on peut ici demander le calcul de la SpO2 \u00e0 tout moment (\u00e7a prend une dizaine de secondes) sachant que l'appareil peut l'enregistrer \u00e0 intervalle r\u00e9gulier pendant que vous dormez, ce qui peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s utile si vous soup\u00e7onnez une apn\u00e9e du sommeil.La Venu 2S b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d'un capteur plus r\u00e9cent que la SQ et j'ai effectivement constat\u00e9 des mesures plus pr\u00e9cises pour la 2S par rapport \u00e0 un capteur \u00e0 l'index que je poss\u00e8de par ailleurs et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement \u00e9talonn\u00e9.Respiration : il s\u2019agit du nombre de respiration par minute. La donn\u00e9e est mesur\u00e9e en temps r\u00e9el en permanence et participe au score de votre sommeil.Fonction de synth\u00e8se :L\u2019aper\u00e7u sant\u00e9 donne un aper\u00e7u de votre \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9. Le score est bas\u00e9 sur plusieurs param\u00e8tres : fr\u00e9quence Cardiaque (FC), variabilit\u00e9 de la FC, taux d'oxyg\u00e8ne sanguin, respiration et stress.Le moniteur d'\u00e9nergie donne votre \u00ab r\u00e9serve \u00bb d'\u00e9nergie tout au long de la journ\u00e9e (\u00e9chelle de 1 \u00e0 100). Un nombre plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 signifie que vous \u00eates pr\u00eat pour une activit\u00e9 ; un nombre plus faible signifie que votre r\u00e9serve d'\u00e9nergie est d\u00e9charg\u00e9e et que vous avez besoin d'une pause.Suivi du stress : c'est un indicateur composite calcul\u00e9 \u00e0 partir des efforts r\u00e9alis\u00e9s et des temps de repos. Tout est pris en compte y compris le nombre de pas ou le nombre d'\u00e9tages parcourus.Suivi de l'hydratation et des calories : ces deux indicateurs demandent votre participation puisque la montre ne peut pas savoir ce que vous absorbez en liquide ou en calories. Par contre elle connait vos d\u00e9penses \u00e0 partir des efforts r\u00e9alis\u00e9s et de vos param\u00e8tres physiques (\u00e2ge, taille, poids). Ceci permet au final de savoir si vous \u00eates en exc\u00e9dent ou en d\u00e9ficit de calories ou d'hydratation.Suivi du cycle menstruel : non test\u00e9Suivi de la respiration : mesur\u00e9e en permanence et en temps r\u00e9el. Je n'ai aucune id\u00e9e sur la m\u00e9thode employ\u00e9e par ces appareils pour mesurer la respiration, mais les chiffres annonc\u00e9s me semblent r\u00e9alistes et viennent compl\u00e9ter les statistiques de suivi.Suivi du sommeil : les 2 montres sont capables de d\u00e9tecter quand vous vous couchez et quand vous dormez. Vous d\u00e9finissez un objectif pour l'heure de coucher et l'heure de r\u00e9veil, et un score est calcul\u00e9 sur la base de la dur\u00e9e et de la qualit\u00e9 de votre sommeil, sachant que les 3 phases (l\u00e9ger, profond et paradoxal) sont d\u00e9tect\u00e9es et suivies. L'historique de votre taux d'oxyg\u00e8ne pendant le sommeil est \u00e9galement g\u00e9r\u00e9.Fonctions g\u00e9n\u00e9ralesActivit\u00e9 : Les montres Venu sont des montres de Fitness orient\u00e9es vers le sport et la sant\u00e9. De nombreuses activit\u00e9s sont g\u00e9r\u00e9es pour tous les types de sports, y compris la natation ou le ski. Une activit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9e manuellement mais aussi automatiquement car la montre d\u00e9tecte vos mouvements et vos d\u00e9placements. Ainsi, si vous d\u00e9marrez une balade, la montre le d\u00e9tecte et d\u00e9clenchera le suivi de l\u2019activit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s un temps que vous d\u00e9finissez mais \u00e0 partir du moment exact de votre d\u00e9part. Elle d\u00e9tectera aussi toute interruption pendant votre marche et la d\u00e9comptera de votre activit\u00e9. Pour les activit\u00e9s en salle, la montre peut se connecter \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents capteurs ext\u00e9rieurs pour am\u00e9liorer le suivi.Notifications du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone : vous pouvez d\u00e9cider via l'application Garmin quelles notifications seront transmises \u00e0 votre montre. La communication s'effectue en Bluetooth et non en Wi-Fi ce qui signifie que la montre doit rester \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone.Suivi et r\u00e9ponses aux messages (SMS, WhatsApp...) : comme pour les notifications, votre montre et votre smartphone peuvent partager les messages et les r\u00e9ponses pour la plupart des applications de messagerie. La montre ne disposant pas d'un clavier, on enregistre des r\u00e9ponses courtes (Oui, Non, Je te rappelle plus tard, etc.) que l'on s\u00e9lectionne avec une liste d\u00e9roulante et que l'on peut envoyer au correspondant sans passer par le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone.Livetrack : cette fonction permet d'informer des proches sur sa position pendant une activit\u00e9. La fonction peut se d\u00e9clencher manuellement ou automatiquement lorsque la montre d\u00e9tecte le d\u00e9marrage d'une activit\u00e9 (course, marche, v\u00e9lo, rando...).Alerte temps r\u00e9el vers un proche : il est possible de d\u00e9finir jusqu\u2019\u00e0 trois contacts pouvant \u00eatre alert\u00e9s (par SMS et email) en cas d'urgence en appuyant pendant 5 secondes sur le bouton sup\u00e9rieur de la montre.Musique : La Garmin SQ simple ne poss\u00e8de pas de lecteur int\u00e9gr\u00e9 et peut juste piloter le lecteur de musique de votre smartphone via Bluetooth.En optant pour les mod\u00e8les SQ ou 2S avec fonction musique, vous disposez de 8Go de m\u00e9moire pour stocker vos MP3 dans la montre, soit par transfert de fichiers via USB (mp3 \u00e0 copier dans le dossier MUSIC de la montre) soit en utilisant l'application Garmin. Il est sans doute possible de transf\u00e9rer des fichiers depuis le smartphone vers la montre en utilisant un c\u00e2ble OTG mais je ne peux le garantir.Les Venu 2S/SQ avec fonction musiques sont \u00e9galement capables d'acc\u00e9der \u00e0 Internet via Wi-Fi et donc d'utiliser les services de streaming, comme Deezer, Spotify ou Amazon Music. Il manque \u00e0 l'appel YouTube Music.Garmin Pay est disponible sur les 2 mod\u00e8les et fonctionne parfaitement, si votre banque supporte le service. Un paiement s'effectuera directement sans contact avec la montre \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sur le terminal de paiement, apr\u00e8s introduction de votre code secret configurable au moment de l'association du service avec votre carte de paiement.L\u2019application Garmin doit obligatoirement \u00eatre install\u00e9e sur votre smartphone pour faire l\u2019appairage et l\u2019initialisation. Elle permet de faire le lien entre la montre et votre smartphone, soit pour le param\u00e9trer, soit pour afficher des statistiques. L'application est tr\u00e8s bien con\u00e7ue et je n'ai eu absolument aucun probl\u00e8me pour l'utiliser, y compris en synchro avec les 2 appareils en m\u00eame temps.Cloud :Le site connect.garmin.com permet de g\u00e9rer tous les appareils Garmin enregistr\u00e9s et d'acc\u00e9der aux tableaux de bord d\u00e9taill\u00e9s de votre activit\u00e9.La boutique ConnectIQ vous permet de t\u00e9l\u00e9charger des centaines d'activit\u00e9s, widgets ou cadrans de montres, sachant que pour ces derniers, la plupart sont modifiables directement depuis la montre.L'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me n'est \u00e9videmment pas aussi \u00e9tendu que Wear OS mais on trouve ce qu'on veut, y compris des boussoles, des logiciels de navigation, etc. Et la plupart de ces applications sont gratuites.Conclusion :Un crit\u00e8re important pour une montre connect\u00e9e est l'autonomie, et de ce point de vue, les deux mod\u00e8les sont tr\u00e8s bons, avec entre 10 et 15% de batterie consomm\u00e9e par jour avec une activit\u00e9 d'une heure utilisant le GPS. Vous pouvez vous contenter de recharger ces montres une fois par semaine.Autre crit\u00e8re important, la pr\u00e9cision du GPS. Et l\u00e0 encore c'est tr\u00e8s bon avec quasiment aucune d\u00e9viation avec un GPS de smartphone.Au final, \u00e0 moins de 200\u20ac la Venu SQ est une super affaire pour celui qui veut s'initier \u00e0 l'usage d'une montre de fitness connect\u00e9e. Avec la 2S on est clairement sur un mod\u00e8le beaucoup plus \u00e9l\u00e9gant et qualitatif, qui conviendra mieux aux petits poignets. Pour ma part j\u2019opte pour la 2S couleur gris clair et cerclage acier que vous voyez sur les photos.",
            "Ok hardware, but software makes very poor use of the new high-resolution AMOLED display.The Venu seems rushed to market to me. It has a nice, bright high resolution display. However, other than a handful of pretty (but mostly featureless) watch faces, the Garmin software makes absolutely no use of the display. Most of the UI and many of the watch faces look pixelated and rough. Whilst Garmin get away with this on the MIP display used on their other always-on smartwatches - the higher resolution display of the Venu just exposes how bad the UI is. If you are expecting the Venu to be a polished version of the Vivoactive you will be very disappointed. This is no Apple/Samsung watch competitor.Added to this, in my copy of the watch, the touch screen display was often unresponsive. It was so bad at recognising left/right swipes that I found it almost impossible to change watch faces.As-is I can't recommend the Venu - the software just isn't fit for purpose. Which is a shame.",
            "(Unten sind 2 Update)Aktuell trage ich, zum Vergleichen, mal eine 120\u20ac Huawei Watch GT active und die neue Garmin Venu.Ich habe mich wie Sau auf die Garmin gefreut, bin aber auf dem Boden der Tatsachen angelangt. Aber von vorne.Vor Jahren trug ich eine Forerunner 235 und war sehr zufrieden. Dann machte ich den Fehler eine Vivoactive 3 zu kaufen. Nachdem ich diese zur\u00fcckgegeben habe bin ich \u00fcber Samsung und Amazfit bei der Huawei Watch GT gelandet (auch bei Amaz. gekauft). Nach der Ank\u00fcndigung der Venu konnte ich es kaum erwarten endlich wieder ein gutes Device zu haben. Zudem, und das sollte man nicht unerw\u00e4hnt lassen, ist das Garmin Webfrontend wirklich gut.350\u20ac will Garmin f\u00fcr diese \u00fcberaus leichte Uhr. Die Leichtigkeit hat mich positiv \u00fcberrascht.Bis heute kann die Garmin-App unter Android scheinbar keine Widgets. Ansonsten ist sie sehr aufschlussreich und detailliert. Als Beispiel im Anhang ein Screenshot des Dashboards. Um kurz vor 10 der letzte Sync um 05:50, autoamtisch wird bei mir nichts gesynct. So machen dann nat\u00fcrlich Widgets auch keinen Sinn.Ich hab dann gleich mal nen Track ausprobiert. Einen Ausschnitt sieht man im angeh\u00e4ngten Bild. Die Huawei trackt diesen Gang genau so bl\u00f6d. Also quer \u00fcber die Stra\u00dfe und dergleichen. Ich bin nat\u00fcrlich straight gegangen. Herzfrequenz und Co stimmen halbwegs \u00fcberein. Zumindest gibt es kein Device welches sich jetzt irgendwie besonders auff\u00e4llig anders verh\u00e4lt. Wo hier 350\u20ac zu verantworten sind? Mir ist das nicht ganz klar.SchlaftrackerHier sind die Daten durchaus unterschiedlich. Aber das liegt an den unterschiedlichen Logiken mit denen die Firmen auswerten. Fair Deal und nachvollziehbarABER: Garmin schafft es auch mit dem neuen Device nicht Nickerchen zu erfassen. Die Huawei macht das mit traumt\u00e4nzerischer Sicherheit. Zudem MUSS ich, wenn ich das alles richtig sehe, noch immer \"Nicht st\u00f6ren\" Zeiten einrichten an die sich die Garmin h\u00e4lt. Bei der Huawei wird dies aufgrund der guten Schlaferkennung \u00fcberfl\u00fcssig.Der Blutsauerstoffsensor h\u00e4lt sich exakt an die eingestellte Zeit die man angeben muss um zu definieren wann man ungef\u00e4hr schl\u00e4ft (wenn man den Sensor nicht ganzt\u00e4gig aktiv l\u00e4sst, ist aber \u00fcberfl\u00fcssig). Das wiederum bedeutet das ich in der Woche um 5 aufstehe - am Wochenende aber bis 9 schlafe. Somit trackt der Oximeter Sensor NUR von 21:30 bis 5 Uhr.Klar, ich k\u00f6nnte das erweitern. Ich frage mich aber wo Garmin die Entwicklung verpasst hat wenn Huawei das mit seiner 120\u20ac Watch GT Active (nicht Watch GT 2) problemlos kann.Das Display.Ist absolut einwadfrei. Als negativ Beispiel sei hier die Amazfit Verge genannt. Die hat selbst im hellsten Modus kaum die Sonne ausgehalten.Allerdings ist das Display der Venu durch den Klarlackplastikring (wie bei der Vivoative 3 Music) k\u00fcnstlich klein gehalten. Es geht aber noch und ist soweit OK. Gef\u00fchlt ist kaum eines der Watchfaces die man im Hauseigenen Store (kostenlos) anbietet wirklich angepasst.Das Design:Ist schon OK. Wenn ich die Watch GT sehe wirklich diese einfach etwas maskuliner, erwachsener und \"st\u00e4rker\".Was mir so gar nicht gef\u00e4llt ist der Umgang seitens Garmin mit den Kunden. Man betreibt ein eigenes Forum, liest aber (nach Supportaussagen) dort gar nicht mit. K\u00fcmmert sich gar nicht drum. Die Venu scheint ein ziemlich problematischer Launch zu sein. Firmware 3.50 ist derzeit 3 Wochen alt und im Venu/Vivoactive 4 Forum h\u00e4ufen sich Probleme. Die VA4 und die Venu sind, bis auf das Display, identisch.Bitte nicht falsch verstehen. Die Huawei hat gen\u00fcgend Schw\u00e4chen. Aber die kostet auch kein kleines Verm\u00f6gen.Aktuell sehe ich keinerlei Grund bei der Venu zu bleiben. Das gro\u00dfartige Webfrontend w\u00e4re tats\u00e4chlich der einzige Grund dazu. Ich werde noch eine FW abwarten und sehen welche \u00c4nderungen Garmin denn nach X Wochen doch dem Kunden noch an die Hand gibt. Ansonsten geht die Venu weinenden Auges zur\u00fcck. Applepreise mit dieser Qualit\u00e4t bin ich nicht bereit zu zahlen. Alleine das der GPS Sensor so ungenau wie der von Huawei ist entt\u00e4uscht mich massiv.Ich frage mich da schon ob veraltetet strukturen und \"festhalten an bekannten Dingen\" dazu f\u00fchrt das es scheinbar im Softwarebereich so wenig Fortschritte gibt. Schlaftracker? Naps? Widgets? Auto-Sync der Daten von der Uhr zum Handy? Alles Teufelszeug oder so gew\u00fcnscht? wenn \"Gew\u00fcnscht\", vom wem? Zu alten Entwicklern oder Firmenentscheidern?------------------------------------------------------------------------>>--->> Update vom 15.11.2019Die Venu geht zur\u00fcck. Sehr sehr schweren Herzens muss ich mir eingestehen das es so keinen Sinn macht. Ich werde Garmin und die Uhr vermissen.Stresslevel/Body Battery.:Garmin ist scheinbar nicht in der Lage Nickerchen zu erkennen. Das macht die \"Body Battery\" zum Witz. Ich w\u00fcrde erwarten das sich meine Batterie auf\u00fcllt wenn ich mich mal ausruhe. Nix da. Geht weiter runter. Parallel f\u00fcllt sie sich auf wenn ich im Stau stehe und mich \u00e4rgere.Schlaftracker:Kaputt wie eh und je. Ich hab, nach der VA3 2018, ein paar Dinge ausprobiert. Samsung, Amazfit, Huawei usw und sogar diese seltsame Nokia Matratze. Sobald ich ein Garmindevice um tue sind meine Shclafwerte komplett im Eimer. Tiefschlaf? Mit viel Gl\u00fcck mal 30 Minuten, eher weniger. Der starre SPOx Sensor, der (scheinbar) nicht OnDemand gestartet werden kann misst in der Regel ~5% weniger als ein 20\u20ac Fingersensor.GPS Tracker:Im letzten Bild (ich wei\u00df das die Auf Amazon zu klein und unscharf sind) ist als Beispiel ein Walk zu sehen. Einmal die Strasse hoch und wieder runter. Nat\u00fcrlich MIT Jacke, wir haben Herbst.Genau das macht meine 120\u20ac Watch GT ebenso mies, oder gut.....der kann ich das verzeihen. Einer 370\u20ac Garmin Venu eher nichtF\u00fcr mich ist hier Ende. Ich sehe mich nicht in der Lage das weiter zu unterst\u00fctzen. Die 3.60 FW, die gestern kam, verbessert dahingehen auch nichts. Wenn Garmin den Betastest an den K\u00e4ufern zu Applepreise durchziehen will? Bittesch\u00f6n. Sollte die Venu mal unter 250\u20ac fallen bin ich wieder dabei. Ich muss halt leider selber kaufen.------------------Update 18.11.2019Sucht man sich in einem Videoportal das Vergleichsvideo von Pocketnavigation zur Fenix 6 so sieht man sehr schnell wie ungenau der GPS Chip ist. Das ist quasi das gleich wie bei dem einfachen Track von mir festgestellt. Da ist so viel daneben.",
            "I've previously owned the Vivoactive 3. When the Vivoactive 4 came along I had no doubt whatsoever that I was going to get it.Then I discovered the Venu which was marketed as a Vivoactive 4 with a better screen.The one (tiny) gripe I always had with my V3 was that the screen colours were not very good and quite flat (even though it's very good in bright light).The Venu changed all that. Very deep colours on a 390 x 390 AMOLED display (vs the 240 x 240 on the V3).The watch has a great number of features and options, but most of them will be familiar to Garmin users. The Body Battery is a neat feature, as is the Pulse Ox, even though I haven't had the chance to test this thoroughly yet.I find the device quite responsive and the battery life (so far) seems very decent.The Venu is very light but looks and feels like a premium product.One difference with the V3 (in the V3's favour) is that the Venu is doesn't have an 'always on' feature, i.e. you have to double tap the screen or press the top button to view. Not an issue though and I can see why they've done that as it would be a huge drain on the battery.All in all I'm very happy with my purchase. There have already been several software updates and I'm sure there will be more going forward to dial in this new product.If functionality comes first and display quality is less of a consideration, go for the Vivoactive 4. If you want the functionality and also enjoy a great display, go for the Venu.",
            "Okay, da ist sie. Man was war ich scharf auf das Teil. Aber leider ist nun, weitgehend, Ern\u00fcchterung eingekehrt.Zun\u00e4chst zu mir: meine erste SmartWatch war eine Garmin, danach kamen diverse andere Modelle,ua. von Fitbit, Mobvoi Ticwatch und Huawei.Schon damals war die Garmin irgendwie umst\u00e4ndlich, bzw. unlogisch zu bedienen. Irgendwie finde ich keine klare Linie auf dem Weg durch die Men\u00fcs. Das hat sich leider in meinem Augen noch verschlimmbessert.Die dazugeh\u00f6rige App(s) sind etwas besser, aber meiner Meinung nach immer noch schlechter als die anderen Hersteller.Es dauert sowohl auf der Uhr, als auch in den Apps etwas l\u00e4nger, sich zurecht zu finden.Zur Hardware: ich wusste, dass ich hier kein Schmuckst\u00fcck bekomme, daf\u00fcr steht Garmin einfach nicht. Ist halt ein Plastikbomber, aber der ist gut verarbeitet, kann man tragen.Die Datenerfassung scheint recht gut zu sein, aber das muss ich noch ein paar Tage beobachten, bis ich mir hier eine endg\u00fcltige Meinung bilden kann.Ich werde diese Rezension weiter aktuell halten und berichten, ob das Dingen hier bleibt, oder zur\u00fcck gehen muss.Wie gesagt, aufgrund der unn\u00f6tig umst\u00e4ndlichen Software bin ich immo noch sehr entt\u00e4uscht.Update 2.9.:Ich mag sie .., irgendwie. Bildschirm ist toll, sie ist gut zu tragen!Aber das Teil nervt.Zum Beispiel Schlaferfassung: geht quasi nur zu den vorher eingestellten Zeiten, von selbst merkt dass Teil nichts. Morgens muss man der Uhr sogar sagen, das man wach ist. Kann zB. Huawei deutlich besser.Beispiel Training: Habe mir \u00fcber die App zwei Krafttrainings ausgesucht und auf die Uhr \u00fcbertragen lassen. Glaubt mal nicht, dass die dort irgendwo zu finden sind.\u00dcberhaupt: die Bedienung ist derma\u00dfen unlogisch, warum macht man das nicht so aufger\u00e4umt und logisch wie die Mitbewerber?Okay, ich \u00fcberlege noch 2 Tage, tendiere aber stark dazu, sie zur\u00fcck zu geben! Schade Garmin...Update 12.10.Tja, da ich immer noch hin und her gerissen war, habe ich Depp den R\u00fcckgabezeitpunkt verpasst. Selbst schuld.Eigentlich hat sich f\u00fcr mich nichts ver\u00e4ndert, ist ne Art Hassliebe geblieben. Garmin hat leider noch keine, f\u00fcr mich entscheidende, Updates gebracht. Werden sie wohl auch nicht mehr, ist scheinbar Firmenpolitik, die Benutzer mit Software, sowohl in der App als auch auf der Uhr, ohne Sinn und Verstand zu \u00e4rgern.Warum z.B. ist der untere Bedienbutton nicht mit einer Funktion belegbar? Oder bin ich zu bl\u00f6d, das zu finden...???Au\u00dfer der Schlaf\u00fcberwachung (wieso lebe ich eigentlich noch?) \u00fcberzeugen mich jedenfalls die Messwerte. Der GPS-Fix dauert in der Regel leider sehr lang. Die angegebene Akkulaufzeit stimmt ungef\u00e4hr.Garmin, da w\u00e4re so viel mehr drin gewesen!",
            "Pros:- Sieht ganz gut aus- Heart-Rate tracking sehr akkurat- Gutes GPS trackingCons *Tief Luft hohl*:- Physische Kn\u00f6pfeDiese sind rechts was beim tragen von Wrist Wraps/Straps beim Bodybuilding/Krafttraining zu versehentlichen ausl\u00f6sen f\u00fchrt. Das ist super nervig- Sleep TrackingEinschlaf, Aufsteht und Wachzeiten sind zwar ziemlich gut, das war es aber auch schon.Vorallem die Tief, Leicht und REM Schlafphasen sind jenseits von gut und B\u00f6\u00dfe. Pro nacht habe ich nur eine Tiefschlafphase welche nahezu direkt nach dem einschlafen liegt und zwischen 10 und 30 minuten liegt, das wars.Bei review videos auf youtube habe ich nahezu identische aufnahmen gesehen.Das wirkt fast so als w\u00fcrde Garmin zuf\u00e4llige werte w\u00e4hlen und diese nach einem gewissen schema anzeigenHierbei handelt es sich jedoch nur um Vermutungen. Ob die Daten vll. doch korrekt sind kann ich leider nicht 100% sagen.Koffein konsumieren ich ggf. 8 std. vorm schlafen gehen das letzte mal (12 mittag) und oftmals (Wochenende) sogar ca. 12 std. zuvor. Darn kann es also nicht liegen.Auch trotz Schlaftabletten (das erste mal das ich welche genommen habe, hei\u00dft ich konnte noch keine Toleranz bilden) haben sie die werte nicht ver\u00e4ndert.- Automatisches starten von Gehen/LaufenDa ich kein L\u00e4ufer bin habe ich nur gehen \"verwendet\". Als Hundebesitzer bin ich hier \u00f6fter drau\u00dfen und das automatische starten funktioniert einfach gar nicht.Initial habe ich etwa 20-30km (\u00fcber mehrere Tage) manuell getracked und dann das automatische tracking angeschalten.Dieses startet entweder gar nicht oder nachdem ich bereits wieder zur\u00fcck bin und gerade durch die Haust\u00fcrewieder rein gehe.- VibrationSelbst auf niedrig ist es noch fast zu viel wobei das gr\u00f6\u00dfere problem die dauer der vibration ist.Je nach gew\u00e4hltem training l\u00f6st der untere Knopf eine bestimmte Aktion aus (Gehen/Laufen = Neue Runde, Krafttraining = Neues Set).Hier vibriert die Uhr dann f\u00fcr gef\u00fchlt 2 Sekunden. Das mag nach einer Kleinlichkeit klingen aber treibt mich in den Wahnsinn.- Rep-Counting bei \"Kraftsport\"Liegt einfach immer gewaltig daneben und das obwohl ich meine \u00dcbungen sehr bewusst und kontrolliert durchf\u00fchre.Da mich aber haupts\u00e4chlich Herzfrequenz interessiert (da ich \u00dcbung/Sets/Reps anderweitig pflege) w\u00fcrde ich dieses feature einfach ausschalten......wenn das denn m\u00f6glich w\u00e4re- App (Android)Auch wenn diese so ziemlich alles anzeigt was man ben\u00f6tigt ist diese ein absolutes Chaos und ben\u00f6tigt ein dringendes Redesign am besten auf Basis der Material Guidelines.Das ist aber das kleinste Mako und vertretbar wenn man sich ein-/zweimal intensiver mit der app besch\u00e4ftigt.- ArmbandHier handelt es sich um ein ziemliches Standard Armband und das nervt. An und Ablegen der Uhr dauert mir einfach viel zu lange und die Schlaufe, wo man das ende des Armbands einf\u00e4delt, ist sehr schwer verschiebbar.Hat man die Uhr nun schon 50% angelegt und merkt das diese Schlaufe falsch positioniert ist, hei\u00dft es entweder wie ein bl\u00f6der \"reisen\" um es zu verschieben oder die Uhr nochmal abnehmen.Wieder eine Kleinigkeit aber trotzdem nervig.Wenigstens eine Sache die man mit 3rd-Party Armb\u00e4ndern l\u00f6sen k\u00f6nnte- ChargingKudos an Garmin daf\u00fcr das sie scheinbar immer den gleichen Ladestecker verwenden und nicht wie bsp. Fitbit mit jeder version einen neuen raus bringen.Nichts desto trotz w\u00fcrde ich mir hier wireless charging w\u00fcnschen auch wenn die Uhr sehr schnell \u00fcber Kabel l\u00e4dt.Auch wieder eine Kleinigkeit \u00fcber die man hinweg sehen kann.Fazit:Da f\u00fcr mich Sleep-Tracking genau so wichtig ist wie das tracking von Training oder sogar noch mehr da Recovery extrem wichtig ist und ich wissen muss wen mein Schlaf WIRKLICH schlecht war um den vortag zu reflektieren und ggf. Anpassungen zu machen, muss ich mich von Garmin leider verabschieden.Sleep-Tracking ist wohl noch nie eine St\u00e4rke von Garmin gewesen und auch wenn Sie einen Blog-Post haben der dar\u00fcber Spricht das es ziemlich Akkurat sein soll kann ich das einfach nicht glauben.",
            "I've had my watch for a few months now and I would now feel naked without it. I didn't wear a watch before so it took some getting used to. Firstly having something on your wrist and then the fact that you can shower with it on as well. It's so easy to use and lightweight.  I only charge the battery once a week which is great and it charges really quickly so I only have to be without it for less than an hour. It's really helped with tracking my activity levels, my calories, my steps but one of the features I love the most is the body battery.  It is so useful to know when I need to slow down, get more sleep and maybe skip the gin and tonic in order to get to 100% the next day. I don't think I could be without this watch now. It's the first smart watch I've had and I love it! No buyers remorse at all!!",

In ogni caso meglio attenersi al proprio tapis!- \ud83c\udfca\u200d\u2642\ufe0fNuoto\ud83c\udfca\u200d\u2642\ufe0f: Sono decisamente un amatore in questo campo, posso solo dirvi che tiene il conto correttamente delle vasche- \ud83d\udca8Esercizi di respirazione\ud83d\udca8: piacevoli, durata a scelta e devo dire che li ho trovati abbastanza rilassanti- \ud83c\udfb6Musica\ud83c\udfb6: lato musica perfetto, personalmente non ho avuto nessun problema a configurare le playlist, Spotify comodissimo e ha individuato le mie cuffie bluetooth in un attimo. Finalmente posso andare a correre senza il fastidio di dover tenere il telefono in tasca/mano/attaccato al braccio!- \ud83d\udcb3GarminPay\ud83d\udcb3: non c'\u00e8 molto da dire, funziona perfettamente!Lo ricomprerei senza alcun dubbio!TARGET: Volete avere qualche dato in pi\u00f9 sulla vostra attivit\u00e0 fisica? Volete avere uno smartwatch carino a vedersi senza spendere 500\u20ac? Allora questo \u00e8 l'orologio che fa per voiCONTRO: Solo la batteria che si scarica in fretta ma devo ammettere che si carica anche piuttosto velocemente quindi 1 oretta in cui state alla scrivania lo potete attaccare e trovarlo al 100%, a me dura circa 3 giorni ma non lo faccio mai arrivare allo 0%",
            "ca fait maintenant 1 semaine que j'ai cette nouvelle Garmin et j'ai essay\u00e9 aussi la VIVOACTIVE 4 juste avant pendant une semaine aussi.au premier coup d\u2019\u0153il, l\u2019\u00e9cran de la VENU n'a rien a voir...a cot\u00e9, la Vivo4 est fade et sans profondeur de couleur.les fonctions sont les meme et le cercle de la montre est plus grand sur la Vivo4 (45 cm contre 43 sur la Venu)Pour moi qui ai un petit poignet, ca compte...Le bracelet aussi est plus petit, 22 mm contre 20 sur la Venu.bien sur, un bel \u00e9cran comme ca a des d\u00e9fauts notamment sa consommation: je tiens environ 3 jours (etteinte la nuit) en mode \"connect\u00e9\". c'est a dire que la montre est coupl\u00e9e au TPH et les notifications s'affiche sur la Venu.A noter que je suis aussi en mode always on: l\u2019\u00e9cran affiche en mode minimaliste l'heure tout le temps et affiches les autres param\u00e8tres quand je tourne mon poignet. ca consomme plus mais je trouve ca plus fun.Avec la vivo4, je tenais 4 jours dans le meme mode. enfin pas tout a fait car l'always on n'existe pas mais les pixels sont toujours presents mais non eclair\u00e9s par le retro \u00e9clairage.j'ai aussi pris un bracelet cuir non Garmin.Il est bien pour tous les jours meme s'il se d\u00e9tache de temps en temps quand la montre est un peu stress\u00e9e (quand le poignet bouge fortement et d\u00e9place la montre). je pense que le syst\u00e8me d\u2019accroche rapide est un poil trop petit et la tension cr\u00e9\u00e9e a ce moment la fait sauter le bracelet.Il n'y a pas ce probl\u00e8me avec le bracelet plastique d'origine.",
            "Good features:Screen - the standout feature and the main reason to go for this watch rather than any other Garmin offeringsBattery life - surprisingly good (4-5 days continuous use without always on display) and in any case it charges up really quicklyGPS tracking - rock solid and finds signal very quickly.  It probably gives you at least 10 hours without music.Appearance - looks very goodMobile app - excellent for data vultures like meConnectivity - no problem staying connected to my smartphoneWeight - very light and comfortable to wearActivity tracking - all aspects work well, including plausible step and floor countingPulse Ox tracking - not sure what the point is but it is a lot of funNot so good featuresSleep tracking - doesn't do a good job, as it thinks you are sleeping all the time you are in bed.  However, this is common to all Garmin devices.  The Fitbit does a much better job here. This means that the body battery reading which is based partly on sleep data is highly suspect tooNotifications - OK but doesn't display icons consistently and there's not much possibility of interaction. The Fitbit does a better job hereNo microphone or speaker - Personally I don't care but it might be an issue for someScreen bezel a tad on the large side though not noticeable if watch face with dark background selectedPrice - high but you are getting a very good watch for your moneyI've owned many smart and not so smart watches, including Garmin, Pebble, Huawei, Samsung, TicWatch and Fitbit offerings. This is the best one I've owned.  In my opinion, for what it's worth, the good massively outweighs the not so good and therefore 5 stars is justified.Possible (cheaper) alternatives:Fitbit Versa 2 - also very good display and sleep tracking is excellent. Notification handling much better. Steps tracking is appalling though and it only has \"connected GPS\". There are also many connectivity problems.Huawei GT Watch 2 - phenomenal battery life and good display but notifications handling is even worse than Garmin, sleep tracking is also suspect and, although workout tracking with GPS is excellent, it cannot be shared with Strava.Garmin Vivoactive 4 - almost the same as the Venu but with transflective (i.e. always on) display and it's a bit cheaper.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0Da parecchi anni ho smartwatch Garmin al polso, soprattutto i modelli Vivoactive che acquisto fin dalla seconda versione. Questa volta volevo provare il tanto decantato schermo amoled del Venu.Lo smartwatch arriva al 100% della carica, quindi ci si pu\u00f2 dimenticare della fase di full-charge iniziale perch\u00e9 \u00e8 gi\u00e0 tutto pronto.La configurazione \u00e8 pressoch\u00e9 immediata se si dispone gi\u00e0 di un account Garmin e dell'app Connect installata.In questo caso viene anche proposta la fase di sincronizzazione dei dati (informazioni anagrafiche, attivit\u00e0, obiettivi, etc...).Rispetto a Vivoactive si pu\u00f2 scorrere tutte le informazioni in un'unica schermata, mentre sul Vivoactive ogni funzionalit\u00e0 occupava tutto il quadrante. Non sono sicuro di apprezzare questa organizzazione ma usando l'orologio mi ci abituer\u00f2 in qualche modo.L'interazione con l'interfaccia \u00e8 molto fluida tranne nel passaggio tra un quadrante e l'altro, quando si seleziona il prescelto tra le opzioni disponibili: poco male.Una delusione sono i quadranti disponibili di default: sono davvero pochi e non particolarmente interessanti visivamente anche se ovviamente si pu\u00f2 attingere allo store di Garmin. Oltre a questo,  i campi dei quadranti non possono essere editati.L'editor parte invece da un quadrante vuoto al quale aggiungere tutte le varie componenti: dati, lancette, sfondo e cos\u00ec via.Mi sono bloccato inizialmente nella prima sincronizzazione con Garmin Connect perch\u00e9 dopo qualche secondo si interrompeva andando in errore. Il motivo dell'errote era che ildisplay del telefono android andava in standby dopo 15 secondo e questo bloccava la sincronizzazione.La soluzione \u00e8 tenere il display sempre attivo per 15-20 minuti in modo che la procedura si chiuda senza intoppi.Il punto debole di questo smartwatch, come riportato anche i molti siti specializzati \u00e8 il fatto che la durata della batteria \u00e8 veramente bassa con il display always-on. Si pu\u00f2 per\u00f2 utilizzare il l'orologio in modalit\u00e0 Vivoactive:  col display sempre attivo ma con i gest disattivati.In questo modo il quadrante sempre attivo in modalit\u00e0 molto soft e in risparmio energetico.Il cinturino ed il quadrante (quello fisico) sono ottimi, eredit\u00e0 del modello precedente.In generale il mio consiglio personale \u00e8 quello di aspettare il Vivoactive 5 perch\u00e9 lo schermo amoled non giustifica una durata della batteria cos\u00ec bassa ed un prezzo cos\u00ec elevato.Dopo anni di evoluzione degli smartwatch, dover ancora fare mille trucchetti per risparmiare batteria sa tanto di amarcord degli anni '90-2000 quando la tecnologia c'era ma era ancora molto acerba.",
            "Generally a good all round product. Only discovering half of what this watch can actually do.  Everything apart from the sleep cycle is reasonably accurate. And works incredibly well under waterHowever my biggest gripe is the materials used to make the watch. Both the screen and watch surround are showing more scratches and general  wear after several months than my old apple watch series 1 did after several years, which is unacceptable for a premium product.",
            "I deeply regret buying this. The battery life is so short so a day's readings can never be accurate and unless you display the heart rate on the watch face (which uses even more battery) you can't even see the reading whilst exercising. This is bad for older people who need to make sure their heart rate is not being exceeded on something like a treadmill - the watch face just goes blank after seconds and the touch screen often does not respond. For such an expensive item I found the cheap plastic wrist strap hard on my wrist and to even get a reading it has to be worn quite tightly which causes discomfort. I would return it for a refund but stupidly threw the box away before really testing the product properly - I assumed it would live up to all the hype.",
            "Had this watch for a week. Brought as update for vio fit. The only thing better on this watch is the display so paid 350 for a screen upgrade.Battery life about 3 days if you use GPS a lot which I do for running and other activities. Seems to be accurate.My biggest complaint is it will not sinc with the garmin app store. It just jams to sort I  have to disconnect from phone and re pair to sort it out. The app store is effectively useless with this watch.Because of this and limited pre loaded apps this not a smart watch. You can get a fitness tracker that will do all this for \u00a350 with a good display I am seriously considering returning as not fit for described purpose \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21",
            "Fratello minore del Venu tondo, perde delle funzioni a mio avviso superflue per chi vuole la sostanza, nonch\u00e9 lo schermo amoled a favore di un LCD, ma c'\u00e8 differenza nell'uso quotidiano? NO, il primo ha sicuramente un impatto visivo maggiore, ma il secondo \u00e8 ben pi\u00f9 che visibile e definito. Perde il barometro questo fattore \u00e8 soggettivo se utile o meno, come lo \u00e8 il fatto di non essere completamente in acciaio inossidabile, questo significa che \u00e8 delicato? NO, al tatto si percepisce la solidit\u00e0. Il touch risponde molto bene al tocco in linea generale. Non c'\u00e8 lo schermo sempre acceso, indispensabile? NO se l'orologio ha un buon sensore del movimento, e questo ce l'ha. Per il resto la sensoristica \u00e8 la medesima, qualit\u00e0 Garmin quale non ha bisogno di descrizione. Il GPS \u00e8 rapido nella recezione del segnale, le notifiche arrivano puntuali ed \u00e8 facile rispondere(al momento nei gruppi WhatsApp NON si pu\u00f2 rispondere). L'estetica \u00e8 soggettiva ma, a mio avviso, sembra che l'azienda non l'abbia affatto trascurata. Traendo le conclusioni, un ottimo sportwatch con funzioni smart, al polso \u00e8 leggerissimo, ottimo anche per chi si approccia per la prima volta in questo mondo, l'azienda ha voluto alleggerire su quello che poteva pensando pi\u00f9 alla praticit\u00e0 che alla forma, questo lo porta ad avere un prezzo 'leggero' per le potenzialit\u00e0 offerteAGGIORNAMENTOdopo 3 mesi di utilizzo ci sono stati diversi aggiornamenti, tra cui la possibilit\u00e0 di rispondere sui gruppi Whatsapp vedendo chi ha scritto cosa, \u00e8 migliorata l'usabilit\u00e0 generale, ma una cosa che ancora mi \"pesa\" \u00e8 la scarsa adesione con le banche per GarminPay. Al di l\u00e0 di questo neo, ad oggi sono ancora soddisfatto dell'acquisto",
            "Ich habe relativ lange nach einer f\u00fcr mich passenden Smartwatch gesucht. Das bedeutet f\u00fcr mich: Eindeutiger Fokus auf Sport und Gesundheit, ansprechendes Design und nicht \"nur ein Fitnessarmband, ein Akku der mehrere Tage durchh\u00e4lt und ein ordentliches Display. Mit der Venu hatte ich den perfekten Fit gefunden - dachte ich zumindest.F\u00fcr mich konnte ich eindeutige St\u00e4rken und Schw\u00e4chen feststellen. Die m\u00f6chte ich nun einmal in Bereiche unterteilen.==================Design & Tragekomfort==================Nat\u00fcrlich ein sehr subjektiver Punkt. Ich finde die Uhr optisch sehr ansprechend. Auch den Tragekomfort fand ich sehr angenehm, was f\u00fcr eine Uhr, die man auch beim Schlafen tr\u00e4gt durchaus wichtig ist. Teilweise kritisiert wurde, dass die Uhr zu gro\u00dfen Teilen aus Plastik ist. Das stimmt und bei rund 380\u20ac kann ich die Kritik teilweise nachvollziehen. Wenn jedoch bedacht wird, dass die Uhr eine Sport-/Allrounderuhr ist, finde ich die Priorit\u00e4ten gut gesetzt. Den Punkt Design & Tragekomfort w\u00fcrde ich als klare St\u00e4rke einordnen.=======Akku=======Der Akku ist auf jeden Fall ein Punkt, bei dem diese Uhr der Konkurrenz voraus ist. Allerdings zehrt auch jede kleine Einstellung am Akku. Niemand stellt die Uhr auf die dunkelste Helligkeitsstufe und deaktiviert fast alle Features. Display etwas heller gestellt -> Akku runter, Auto-Synchronisation -> Akku runter, SpO2 Sensor nicht dauerhaft aus -> Akku runter. Von den beworbenen 5 Tagen bleiben realistisch ca. 3 Tage. Mit nachts aktiven SpO2-Sensor, 5 Aktivit\u00e4ten pro Woche und 3/4-Displayhelligkeit geht es auf ca. 2 bis 2,5 Tage runter. Ich w\u00fcrde den Punkt als kleine St\u00e4rke sehen. Man h\u00e4tte die Marketing-Keule aber etwas realistischer ansetzen k\u00f6nnen.=========Funktionen=========Insgesamt wie gesagt ein Sportallrounder. Die Features sind haupts\u00e4chlich Sportfokussiert mit kleineren, alltagstauglichen Smartwatch-Funktionen. Einiges ist jedoch eher Spielerei. Der SpO2-Sensor ist z.B. nicht so in der App implementiert, dass er sp\u00fcrbaren Nutzen bringt. Als bisher non-Garmin-Nutzer fand ich auch die Body Battery Funktion sehr spannend. Auch die hat sich f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich jedoch eher als Spielerei entpuppt. Mit den Funktionen war ich insgesamt zufrieden. Die Aktivit\u00e4tsaufzeichnung ist gut und detailliert. Was ich mir gew\u00fcnscht h\u00e4tte, ist eine Verarbeitung der Details zu einem Score, \u00e4hnlich wie es Fitbit macht. Da bin ich mir nicht sicher, ob ich stets zu blind war das zu finden oder ob es keine simple Zusammenfassung gibt.Insgesamt f\u00fcr mich ein solider Punkt, allerdings nichts, was die Uhr ausmacht.=========Sensoren=========Dieser Punkt ist in meinem Fall die absolute Achillessehne der Uhr. Den m\u00e4\u00dfig sinnvollen SpO2-Sensor habe ich bereits erw\u00e4hnt. Allerdings sind auch restliche Messungen bei meiner Uhr absolut Katastrophal gewesen. D.h. die Uhr hatte eine sehr seltsame Interpretation meines Schlafes. Oft soll ich schon um 19:00 Uhr eingeschlafen sein. War ich um 02:30 Uhr wach, war das egal. Je nachdem habe ich dort angeblich leicht oder in der REM-Phase geschlafen. Das hat sich dazu entwickelt, dass nicht die Uhr meinen Schlaf, sondern ich die Uhr \u00fcberwacht habe. Treppen wurden inkorrekt gez\u00e4hlt. Ich habe mich einen Tag nur im Haus bewegt. Sprich jede Treppe nach oben = Treppe nach unten. Gemessen: 16 Treppen hoch, 22 runter. Beim Stress war ich bei einer anstrengend Innenstadt-Autofahrt absolut tiefenentspannt, aber beim Abend vorm Fernseher war ich wohl panisch gestresst. Bei bisherigen Fitnessuhren hatte ich einen Ruhepuls von 49-53. Damals habe ich noch mehr Sport gemacht. Trotz heute weniger Sport attestiert mir die Venu einen Ruhepuls von 42-47.Diese Fehler haben mich dazu bewegt, die Uhr zur\u00fcckzusenden.======Fazit======Die Uhr ist ein passender Allrounder, mit noch einigerma\u00dfen akzeptablen Preis-/Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis. Das w\u00e4re mein Fazit, wenn die Messungen funktioniert h\u00e4tten. Ich wei\u00df nicht, ob es nur an meinem Ger\u00e4t lag. An mir sollte es nicht liegen, bei allen bisherigen Uhren hatte ich zumindest nie derartige Probleme. Mit dem absoluten Totalausfall in Sachen Sensoren ist die Venu meiner Erfahrung nach eine schlechte Wahl. Soetwas sollte bei dem Preis auch nicht im Ausnahmefall vorkommen.",
            "Do yourself a favour and avoid the seller I used (they were (likely still are) in Spain) so I got hit for import tax, I tried to cancel once I realised but they were extremely unhelpful.  I won't name and shame, but if you're going for it, find one in the Uk (or your country)That's the downside, the upside is the device itself, its superb. Does everything my Apple Watch does without the pretentiousness of it, and unlike apple, Garmin seem to know how to make batteries too!Well recommended",
            "I have recently upgraded from the Garmin v\u00edvosmart HR as I was looking for a fitness tracker that looks more like a watch. I am very please with the all the features of the watch and the ability to change the watch face to suit your needs is a great feature. the big clear display makes it easy to read while exercising. The Garmin App is also great and links to my fitness pal app so I can check my calorie intake etc. The battery life is OK but does depend on how you set the watch up based on the setting I have the watch will last around 3-4 days .I would recommend this watch",
            "J'ai re\u00e7u cette montre connect\u00e9e il y a deux jours . J'ai choisi cet article parce que je suis une habitu\u00e9e de la marque puisque j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu des Vivofit 2 et 3 .Mais pourquoi prendre un mod\u00e8le plus cher ??  C'est parce qu'une geek sommeille en moi  et que je voulais pouvoir suivre mon rythme cardiaque \u00e0 l'effort sans porter de ceinture autour du thorax . Ce qui m'a s\u00e9duite aussi c'est la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00e9couter de la musique \u00e0 partir de la montre sans trimballer mon portable en ballade ou pendant un exercice . En parlant de musique ce qui m'a fait \u00e9carter la Fitbit c'est qu'on ne peut t\u00e9l\u00e9charger des listes musicales qu'\u00e0 partir de Deezer ou Amazon et seulement piloter Spotify sur votre portable  et que je suis abonn\u00e9e \u00e0 Spotify . Avec la Venu sq musique vous pourrez t\u00e9l\u00e9charger des titres \u00e0 partir de Spotify , Deezer Amazon entre autres et votre propre musique ( semble t'il , j'ai pas encore essay\u00e9 ) . Sinon la montre est tr\u00e8s compl\u00e8te avec plein d'exercices qu'on peut surveiller dont l'elliptique , le tapis en salle , et le v\u00e9lo en salle ( \u00e0 condition de disposer d'un accessoire compteur de vitesse ou de cadence \u00e0 fixer sur le v\u00e9lo , j'attends le mien ) . Sinon au niveau des param\u00e8tres physiologiques , c'est tr\u00e8s complet avec des choses amusantes comme le niveau de stress ou le compteur d'\u00e9nergie interne . Dans ce qui compte vraiment les pulsations sont  justes ( j'ai control\u00e9 ) et le sommeil aussi dans la mesure ou on se couche pour dormir et qu'on se l\u00e8ve d'un bond d'un seul , sans flemmarder , ni lire , ni surveiller tristement les statistiques du Covid sur sa tablette .... l'oxym\u00e9trie n\u00e9cessite une immobilit\u00e9 absolue pour bien fonctionner .Une chose est sure c'est que cette montre  occupe , meme avec une grosse habitude des logiciels informatiques la r\u00e9gler pour l'adapter \u00e0 vos possibilit\u00e9s sportives est quand meme un peu compliqu\u00e9 et le manuel d'utilisation t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeable aide mais n'explique pas tout . Ceci dit j'ai eu un petit souci avec un \u00e9cran de veille dont je n'arrivais pas \u00e0 me d\u00e9barrasser , un petit coup de chat avec  Garmin et c'\u00e9tait arrang\u00e9 . Donc vous n'etes pas seul !! Il y a aussi le site IQ Connect ou vous pourrez t\u00e9l\u00e9charger des cadrans et des applications dont Spotify  , la plupart gratuites . Cot\u00e9 esth\u00e9tique , elle est vraiment \u00e9l\u00e9gante meme si un peu grosse pour mes petits poignets , mais l'\u00e9cran est bien lisible . Cot\u00e9 batterie c'est comme de tout , si vous la sollicitez beaucoup il faudra la charger souvent .

            "Optisch gibt es an der Uhr nichts zu bem\u00e4ngeln. Sie sieht gut aus, das Display ist sehr gut ablesbar, Touch-Bedienung funktioniert auch gut, sie ist deutlich leichter als meine bisherige Fenix 5s.Ich habe die Uhr trotzdem retourniert weil:1. Akkulaufzeit - ich hatte die Uhr von Freitag Mittag bis Samstag Abend in Verwendung und musste zwei Mal den Akku aufladen. Auch wenn durch die Einrichtung der Uhr einiges an Energie verbraucht wird ist eine derart kurze Akkulaufzeit nicht akzeptabel.2. st\u00e4ndige Verbindungsprobleme: die Bluetoothverbindung zwischen Uhr und Handy war permanent unterbrochen und musste wieder neu hergestellt werden - vermutlich auch ein Grund f\u00fcr die kurze Akkulaufzeit.2. Synchronisation mit der App funktioniert nicht wirklich. Mal werden die Daten von der Uhr in der App angezeigt, dann wieder nicht.3. Nachrichten vom Handy kommen mal auf der Uhr an, dann wieder nicht. (klar - ist ja auch die Bluetooth-Verbindung st\u00e4ndig weg)4. WLAN Verbindung: Bei einrichtung von Amazon Music auf der Uhr konnte zwar die angelegte Playlist angezeigt werden, wollte ich diese aber abspielen war pl\u00f6tzlich keine Verbindung mit dem WLAN da. Wie kann dann die Playlist angezeigt werden, wenn keine WLAN-Verbindung vorhanden ist?5. Die Bluetooth-Verbindung mit den Kopfh\u00f6rern war schlicht nicht hinzubekommen.So ist die Uhr leider unbrauchbar.M\u00f6glich, dass es sich um Kinderkrankheiten handelt, da die Uhr ja gerade erst erschienen ist. Bei der n\u00e4chsten Charge ist das wom\u00f6glich schon alles behoben.Ich habe die Uhr zur\u00fcck geschickt und werde wohl meiner Fenix 5s treu bleiben, die tut selbst nach zwei Jahren noch was sie soll.",
            "I love this watch. I have upgraded from a forerunner 35. I was toying about this since it was released and after reading DC Rainmakers review I went for it. Easy to use and setup. Overall for the activities that I do, I am very happy.",
            "Premetto che ho dovuto richiedere la sostituzione del primo campione in quanto si spegneva da solo senza motivo.Aspetti Positivi: \u00e8 un bell'orologio esteticamente, di dimensioni generose senza essere un padellone da 46mm che sinceramente trovo poco elegante anche per chi ha un polso come il mio per nulla esile. E' fatto di materiali di qualit\u00e0 e ben refinito, per cui averlo al polso fa un bell'effetto. Ed gli aspetti positivi finiscono qui.Aspetti Negativi: la betteria non dura i 5-6 gg dichiarati. Se si vuole avere un orologio che durante l'arco della giornata e nottata collezioni i vari dati (battito, stress, sonno ecc), che quando si legge l'ora lo schermo non si spenga dopo 1 secondo, o che comunque funzioni al massimo delle propri potenzialit\u00e0, allora la durata si riduce a massimo 2 gg. Io ogni volta che mi faccio la doccia lo metto in ricarica almeno per 1 ora al giorno per sicurezza. Poi la navigazione... molto deludente. Prima avevo un Galaxi della Samsung che ritenevo un orologio inferiore al blasonato Garmin.. in realt\u00e0 era molto pi\u00f9 efficiente e funzionale. Mi data dati costanti e precisi senza troppe complicazioni.. Questo Garmin sembra lento di comprendonio... non capisce che mi sto allenando per cui ogni volta dovrei dire che ho iniziato un allenamento affinch\u00e8 registri sforzo, calorie ecc.. Una cosa che non trovo concepibile da uno \"smart\" watch. Poi il tanto decantato display Amoled non \u00e8 nulla di speciale anzi. Diciamo che \u00e8 poco luminoso (proprio la caratteristica che invece dovrebbe contraddistinguerlo). Alle volte faccio fatica a leggere l'ora. Il Samsung che avevo era molto pi\u00f9 visibile e chiaro nella lettura dell'ora e dei dati.Insomma sono stato deluso dall'acquisto, ma ormai me lo tengo come orologio che mi da solo ora e qualche altro dato superfluo. Non lo consiglio per gli atleti.",
            "I ordered this with high hopes yet became bitterly disappointed. It became clear very soon on that this watch has been released far too early, probably in an attempt to fashion itself against other smart fitness watches...Their issue is... It just isn't smart! The software is largely flawed in the fact that they've tried to write their own, leading to key advertised features just not being ready for market as it's 'still in development' such as the NFC...My bank reportedly wasn't supported... Natwest ie. RBS, one of the largest in the UK.The battery life too; not adequate and the screen, to say it's a flagship smart watch for the company featuring an AMOLED screen... Do yourself a favour Garmin and invest in the software to show off this screen please! There's no point if you supply customers with low res graphics.You either have the watch screen on constantly giving you extremely poor battery life or you have it activate upon a wrist turn... The latter would be brilliant, if it was as responsive as you'd expect... But alas, it disappointed. Again.This watch is not worth even the lower price tag of \u00a3290 that I paid.I've resorted to buying the little known Honor Magic Watch 2 for half the price which gives me a stunning screen, accurate continuous fitness readings, music control and... TWO WEEKS BATTERY LIFE.100% paying for the brand here and not the tech/software. Disappointing to say the least.",
            "Having had several Wear OS devices the battery life has always been a downside. I like the ability to monitor my notifications, heart and GPS track walks. With these 3 requirements and extended battery life I started to look at fitness trackers and Garmin.This device is superb, I cannot fault it.The options to track are vast, there is pulse oxygen, hydration, sleep, stress, intensity and more. It has the ability to track workouts I didn't know existed and even provides some videos / animation on how to perform the activity correctly.Of my main criteria I was looking at:Monitor Notifications - Through the app you can select which apps from your phone send notifications through to the device which is good at limiting the notifications to what you needHeart rate - Constantly tracked with improved accuracy against my previous Wear OS deviceGPS tracking - this is extremely accurate however it doesn't link directly to Viewranger which I was using previously, now needs to export the GPX file to have everything in ViewrangerBattery life - Running the device I appear to be getting a stable 7-8days with some GPS tracking within that. Once a week charge works fine and is a big improvement from almost daily on Wear OS.Lastly, the Garmin Connect and Connect IQ apps are a must. They take some navigating and a while to understand purely due to so much being available. The graphically analysis of all the tracking is superb. The Connect IQ is more of an app store which allows you to find additional tracking options, music storage and watch faces. After several itterations of watch face I have found a minimal look which still provides plenty of top level details (Summit Watch Face V2).If you're looking for your next wearable and questioning whether to go with Garmin vs Other options I highly recommend you go with the Garmin!",
            "Read lots of reviews on this before I bought it as it\u2019s a lot of money but I think it\u2019s worth it. Very comfortable to wear, lots of information viewable on the watch which you can swipe through. Display is brilliant.and the accuracy seems to be excellent. I would buy it again. My one slight gripe is I don\u2019t have the constant display on to save battery, so to display you raise your arm to look, I think the display time is slightly too short. Probably will be upgraded on Venu 3! Great not to have the phone strapped to my arm.",

            "Unreliable data, showing over 100 steps before getting up in the morning and definitely not walking, and showing 1113 kcal used 4 min after midnight - midnight is the turning point. Sometimes it doesn't pick up sleeping data at all. Very slow synchronization since the last update and I'm constantly on chat support because the watch makes its own decisions - it removes data displays or changes settings. The touch screen is so unresponsive, you have to tap it 8-10 times sometimes for the watch to come on. When cycling, there's no display for kcal used only heart rate and time passed, you can only see the overall calories for the workout once synced, this is not useful for weight loss. I get notifications regularly that I just hit my step target when doing the dishes or washing my hair. The most bothering error is when doing high impact cycling, barely alive, and the watch showes my heartrate at 120 (should be above 160) and it doesn't change one bit for half an hour. This results in showing an activity normally measure around / above 500 kcal to be 200 at best. The battery lasts 3 days at best. Disconnects from phone 100 times a day. In addition, the strap caused a really bad irritation to my skin. Normal use left the watch looking battered, and I only do normal daily tasks and cycling while wearing it, but looks like it was dragged along on gravel. For this price I would have expected a watch that works and lasts, but the only reliable info on it is the time.",

Io ho un polso di 17cm. Sul mio polso \u00e8 perfetto.Il quadrante \u00e8 luminosissimo ma il display potevano utilizzarlo meglio in quanto alcuni dati sono troppo piccoli come anche le notifiche e senza occhiali purtroppo mi diventa un po' difficile leggerli. Per lo sport tipo fitness, corsa, pesi e altro va benissimo. Il software installato per la gestione dell'orologio lascia un po' a desiderare. E' anche touch screen ma non hanno messo il movimento da destra verso sinistra...(perch\u00e8 non lo avete messo????). La navigazione del men\u00f9 \u00e8 abbastanza scandalosa rispetto ad altri orologi. Ha diversi lag! (nulla a che vedere con apple watch o Suunto7) Ottimo il discorso della musica tramite Amazon o Spotify che invece molti altri orologi non hanno. Ottimo il fatto del display always on. La batteria ha una discreta durata. Il cinturino abbastanza piccolo ma confortevole e traspirante. Ottima la connessione con la App sul telefono e la wifi integrata per gli aggiornamenti. Non adatto a sport estremi e per donne che hanno un posto piccolo. Non so se lo ricomprerei adesso che \u00e8 uscito il Suunto 7 soprattuto per il fatto del display che a me personalmente risulta un po' difficile da leggere soprattuto nelle notifiche. Consigliato a chi ci vede bene o a chi porta sempre gli occhiali, a chi vuole un orologio leggero e confortevole di giorno che di notte, a chi non fa sport estremi e chi vuole sentire musica durante l'allenamento lasciando il telefono a casa.

Buying the 2S is definitely the right move for us ladies as you don't want something super bulky on your wrist. Battery life is very good. A few days if not running and using GPS.

            "Ich habe die Uhr jetzt seit einem Monat im Test. Mir gef\u00e4llt diese immernoch sehr gut. Mich hat das endlich mal viereckige Design und der helle Display und trotzdem moderate Preis zum Kauf \u00fcberzeugt. Sie sieht genauso aus, wie auf den Bildern, trackt super meine L\u00e4ufe und ist auch im Alltag ein guter Begleiter. Die Bluetooth Verbindung zum Handy ist im ganzen Haus problemlos. Ich kann es nicht nachvollziehen, dass die Uhr in Verbindung mit Handschuhen oder anderen Wristbands durch die auf der rechten Seite liegenden Kn\u00f6pfe ausgel\u00f6st wird, da diese Uhr auch jederzeit gesperrt werden kann und erst durch langes gedr\u00fcckt halten einer der Kn\u00f6pfe entsperrt werden kann. Ebenso wurden bei mir noch keine Schritte im Schlaf getrackt allerdings kann man die Schritte tats\u00e4chlich einfach durch vor und zur\u00fcck bewegen des Arms im stehen oder sitzen schnell nachstellen.Was ich teilweise nervig fand war, dass ich der Garmin Connect App Zugriff auf mein gesamtes Handy geben musste und sonst t\u00e4glich mehrfach damit genervt wurde. Dies h\u00e4tte man aber bestimmt in den Einstellungen ausstellen k\u00f6nnen. Das habe ich leider nicht ausprobiert.",

I love the GPS position widget, which will be really handy on a trail, if you get lost, or are reading a map in bad weather.This watch is stylish, fits well, and is a bonus being waterproof, it only leaves my wrist when it needs charging.

            "Meine zweite Smartwatch ist am Dienstag angekommen und ich echt begeistert. Warum?- Tolles und helles Display. Meine vorherige Uhr hatte schon ein AMOLED Display und ich wollte wieder eines haben. Garmin hat nach meiner Meinung ein gutes verbaut und es schaut echt gut aus.- GPS: ich habe beim Joggen beide Uhren miteinander verglichen und dann die aufgezeichneten Strecken auf der Karte miteinander verglichen. Die Venu ist wesentlich genauer.- Leicht: ein Metallgeh\u00e4use h\u00f6rt sich zwar gut an, ich habe f\u00fcr mich aber gemerkt, dass es beim Sport eher von Nachteil ist weil die Uhr viel schneller verrutscht (ist einfach mehr Gewicht was in Bewegung ger\u00e4t). Tja und durch das verrutschen kann man die Pulsmessung  dann vergessen. Die Venue merkt man kaum am Handgelenk, verrutscht dadurch weniger und ich vertraue der Pulsmessung mehr.- Pulsmessung: siehe Punkt \"leicht\" + passt schon. Den Vergleich mit einem Brustgurt habe ich noch nicht gemacht aber der Eindruck ist gut.- Benachrichtigungen und Sync. mit dem Telefon: funktioniert so wie es soll- Akku: dazu sage ich einfach nur SUPER! Wie gesagt, die Uhr ist am Dienstag angekommen und nach 60 Stunden inkl. Einrichtung, Update, Ausprobieren, 2 Sporteinheiten, Pulsmessung ist immer an etc. hat die Uhr noch 63% Akku. Nachts trage ich die Uhr \u00fcbrigens nicht.Zusammenfassung: bisher voll und ganz zufrieden.Update 24.10: immer noch voll zufrieden.  Akku: ich lade die Uhr mittlerweile einmal in der Woche am Sonntag....w\u00fcrde aber auch noch einen Tag mehr laufen :-)",
            "Ich bin von der Forerunner 235 gewechselt und hatte schon eine Weile die venu als den Nachfolger auserkoren.  Als diese dann mit schneller Lieferzeit verf\u00fcgbar war, habe ich direkt \u00fcber Amazon bestellt. Eins Vorweg: ich habe mein Exemplar nach 4 Tagen zur\u00fcckgesendet.Der erste Anschein ist echt toll. Das Display ist Welten besser, als das von der Forerunner und die Bedienung \u00fcber den Touchscreen ist intuitiv. Die Qualit\u00e4t und die Verarbeitung l\u00e4sst keine W\u00fcnsche \u00fcbrig. Also stellt sich die Frage, warum ich die Uhr zur\u00fcckgesandt habe.1.) Garmin nutzt das tolle Display meines Erachtens nicht. Au\u00dfer einer besseren Darstellung, sehe ich nicht mehr Informationen als bei meiner Forerunner. Ich hatte gehofft, dass ich irgendeine Karte darstellen kann (siehe Fenix 5), aber das alles geht nicht. Au\u00dferdem schaltet sich das Display immer wieder aus um Strom zu sparen. Das ist nach dem Umstieg von dem immer anzeigenden Display der Forerunner sehr merkw\u00fcrdig.2.) Ich nutze die Uhr vor allem zum Lauftraining und erstelle beim Start \u00fcber die Uhr z.B.: eine Intervalleinheit. Die Option wurde gestrichen. Ich kann nur noch vorab \u00fcber den PC/Smartphone geplante Trainings absolvieren.3.) Ich hatte etwas mehr Smartwatch erwartet. Meine Whatsapp Nachrichten werden immer noch nicht dargestellt. Es wird nur der Name der Person angezeigt. Bei Mails oder anderen Mitteilungen sieht man etwas mehr, aber halt genau so viel, wie ich vorher auf der Forerunner 235 gesehen habe.Alles in allem war mir die bessere Darstellung der gleichen Inhalte wie auf der Forerunner und die fehlende Option zur Erstellung des Trainings der ausschlaggebende Punkt.

Ultimately there seems to have been very little progress made from Garmins vivoactive back in 2015PRO's(1) Nice Screen which is Bright and 390 x 390 resolution (AMOLED)(2) Always on feature(3) Pretty Decent Battery life (though not fully tested with music on)(4) Good heart rate accuracy(5) LightweightCON's(1) Very cheap material, big disappointment, this watch probably cost about \u00a32 to manufacture (not value for money)(2) Pairing headphones.. constant issues with them not connecting - resorted to wired mp3 player(3) Too many pointless fads, not based on accurate information (i.e Sleep, Stress Levels etc) pointless(4) When pausing the watch, after a small period it keeps finishing the activity so i have to create a new one mid-run/cycle(5) Don't like the 3mm blackboarder - Why can't they do a edge to edge screen?(6) GPA Accuracy and Average pace is a bit all over the place.I'll be sending this back and continue to use my old one until something more innovative comes available.",
            "I've had this watch for around 4 weeks now and it is my first Garmin watch. Previously I have owned a Fitbit and Wear OS watch and if I'm honest I'm gutted it took me this long to discover Garmin watches - it is far superior in every way to those watches.Battery lifeI get 7 days from my watch between charges. This includes a couple of runs so the use of GPS on the watch. Charging is fast and goes from low % to 100% in less than an hour.Activity trackingStep tracking seems good and accurate and I've used the GPS on lots of runs now. So far very reliable and matches the GPS tracking on my phone so accurate too.Data and Garmin connect appProbably the best thing about this watch is the level of data and insight it gives in to your activity. It really is excellent and the level of info in the Garmin connect app is far superior even to activity tracking apps such as Strava.ScreenGreat quality and nice, clear, sharp display.My only negatives, and they are only minor:The app store feels a little clunky. You can't filter on Garmin apps for example so have to trawl through all the 3rd party apps to find them. I also wish they'd provide a screen protector with the watch - for \u00a3300 I think this should be a minimum particularly given the screen is curved and will be quite easy to scratch if you are not careful.Overall a great watch and definitely recommend.",
            "Got this watch to connect to my Amazon music prime account, however the watch is not compatible with a UK account so I\u2019m unable to use it with my Amazon account. Not very helpful.",
            "I tried Fitbit Sense before buying Venu but had to return sense as it was a huge disappointment. On the other hand, Venu is brilliant, perfectly compatible with my android phone and set up was easy and quick.The app is good and the features are great. Overall I am very happy with the watch. Have been using it for a week now and only charged it once. Highly recommended.",
            "I had high hopes for this watch. I have a well used Vivoactive 3 with music that has served me well for a few years.I was hoping the the brighter, sharper, screen would be a worthwhile upgrade.The screen is nicer but it's almost always off, I don't want to be flicking my hand about to see the time.The nail in the coffin was the awful app. Garmin isn't known for good software but even by their low standards the combo of Garmin connect and Connect IQ is a baffling choice.Why two apps?Why do I need to enter my WiFi password into the app?Why do all the updates just sit in a queue for hours?Why is it so hard, and slow, to sign in to Spotify and sync some music?The out of the box and getting started experience, which should be perfect, was awful.I returned this watch after less than 12 hours of use, I don't think I'll be buying another Garmin wearable.",
            "Premetto che ho usato negli ultimi mesi sia Apple Watch che diversi Amazfit, per poi passare a questo. Il mio primo Garmin.Che dire. Sono rimasto veramente soddisfatto per la facilit\u00e0 d'uso e le molteplici funzionalit\u00e0 per l'attivit\u00e0 sportiva (e l'intelligenza nel capire cosa stiamo facendo in base alle attivit\u00e0 scelte, come le serie, il tipo di esercizio ecc ecc).I sensori sono precisi, sia battito che monitoraggio sonno.La batteria dura 7 giorni.Notifiche e emoji sono visualizzate meglio di molti smartwatch (non Apple) che ho provato.Non capisco tutte queste critiche. Con meno di 200\u20ac vi portate a casa il dispositivo pi\u00f9 completo per questa fascia di prezzo. E con gli ultimi aggiornamenti \u00e8 migliorato ancora di pi\u00f9.Certo, \u00e8 pi\u00f9 uno sportwatch che smartwatch, quindi a fluidit\u00e0 non aspettatevi chiss\u00e0 cosa, ma si sa, Garmin ha questo OS anche su orologi da pi\u00f9 di 700\u20ac.  \u00c8 una filosofia che da priorit\u00e0 all'affidabilit\u00e0 dei sensori e dei dati piuttosto che al sistema \"fighetto\".Il display \u00e8 buono (ho visto di meglio senza dubbio), colori ben equilibrati e neri abbastanza neri (ovviamente essendo un LCD non aspettatevi neri al pari di un amoled). Risoluzione un po' bassina, ma i dati si leggono bene in ogni condizione. Un amoled sarebbe stato perfettoPer ora \u00e8 lo smartwatch/sportwatch pi\u00f9 equilibrato che abbia mai provato.Senza dubbio.",
            "This watch for the most part is good for the price. It has an attractive, intuitive display and lots of useful features.The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because it has had a couple of issues syncing specific workouts. For example if I do two activities in a day one may sync and the other won't. This isn't good enough for a \u00a3180 watch and Garmin's advice on how to upload these unsynced activities is convoluted and requires a laptop.Overall, I'm happy enough with the watch, but it clearly has some issues that need to be rectified.",
            "I ordered this with high hopes yet became bitterly disappointed. It became clear very soon on that this watch has been released far too early, probably in an attempt to fashion itself against other smart fitness watches...Their issue is... It just isn't smart! The software is largely flawed in the fact that they've tried to write their own, leading to key advertised features just not being ready for market as it's 'still in development' such as the NFC...My bank reportedly wasn't supported... Natwest ie. RBS, one of the largest in the UK.The battery life too; not adequate and the screen, to say it's a flagship smart watch for the company featuring an AMOLED screen... Do yourself a favour Garmin and invest in the software to show off this screen please! There's no point if you supply customers with low res graphics.You either have the watch screen on constantly giving you extremely poor battery life or you have it activate upon a wrist turn... The latter would be brilliant, if it was as responsive as you'd expect... But alas, it disappointed. Again.This watch is not worth even the lower price tag of \u00a3290 that I paid.I've resorted to buying the little known Honor Magic Watch 2 for half the price which gives me a stunning screen, accurate continuous fitness readings, music control and... TWO WEEKS BATTERY LIFE.100% paying for the brand here and not the tech/software. Disappointing to say the least.",
            "Garmin Venu (posh version review)This is a great watch with a couple of problems. The display is a big improvement on the always on but pretty dull Vivoactive HR, The way it gets round the extra power draw of the OLED is by activating it when you turn it to your face or if there is a notification. There is a pronounced delay when it does this making it impossible to just glance at it like you would with a normal watch. The buttons aren't that well thought out. I've triggered the activity stop button mid workout when the edge of my glove pushes up my wrist. You can mitigate this by loosening it and pushing it up your arm a bit before you get going.However, the functionality is very good. Much better sensors, it can track breathing and blood oxygen. It communicates much better over bluetooth than the Vivioactive HR. The GPS seems more accurate and I get much better altitude change precision with it.Battery life is good unless you engage the PulseOX blood oxygen level tracking at which point you'll be lucky if you get two days out of it.Overall, great watch, well worth it. Get plugs for the charger port though or it will clog.",
            "I upgraded from vivoactive HR 3. I have to say display is much prettier but much less functional. Watch is:- hard to wake up during day use- not responsive for scrolling- can\u2019t turn off the light at night and when I move it wake up and... wake me up with light- I have allergic reaction to silicon watch band included with the watch (I own Garmin watches since 2015 and didn\u2019t have this issue with any of the previous models)Good sides:- battery lifeI think I wouldn\u2019t buy it just for the display. At the moment Garmin call centre is down couple of days so can\u2019t get help with the watch band... maybe this is just one off.If you consider smart watch, vivoactive 3 or 4 has the same functions and are better value for money. Only new thing is ox tracking, that kills the only advantage of the watch which is battery life... body battery is useless feature (don\u2019t think it actually shows true data, I base it on 3 weeks experience with the watch). This device is simply not worth \u00a3300",
            "I found the touch screen frustratingly poor. Sometimes having to touch the screen 5 or 6 times to register and scroll left or right 3 -5 time before the screen scrolled. I also found the watch faces very poor and you have to use 2 different apps just to install one. It didn't integrate well with my iPhone. It worked OK but seemed very basic in functions. When I sent it back I decided to buy an Apple watch which unfortunately cost about \u00a3240 more! But wow, what an amazing difference, like swapping a Fiat Panda for a Merc. It's arguably unfair to compare 2 products with such a price difference but I think if you have an iPhone you need an Apple watch. Apple seem to ensure that's the case by possibly restricting competitive products?",
            "il monitoraggio degli sport va abbastanza bene, tuttavia ci sono numerosi problemi:-sincronizzazione molto lenta e spesso non va a buon fine-monitoraggio del sonno completamente sballato, vengono sempre aggiunte numerose ore e il sonno profondo risulta praticamente assente in ogni misurazione-in posizione supina il quadrante non si accende con il movimento del polso anche se non si sta dormendopossono sembrare piccolezze, ma pensavo che garmin fosse garanzia di perfezione",
            "The good things (won't take long) - you can connect both an android phone and iPhone using the Garmin Connect app- nice form factor, very light and comfortable to wear- very good battery life if you don't use GPS all the time- for serious runners there is a huge choice of data recording and analysis features...too much for a light runner like meThe bad things- poor selection of watch faces with little option to modify the data points- screen is disappointing, way behind that on the apple watch and Samsung Active 2- screen shows signs of being laggy when swiping, it can be unresponsive and makes the whole experience feel like a let down- the screen on mine would dim for no reason, then pulse bright and dim for no reason, I'm sure it must have been faulty in some respect- on both my iPhone and Xperia 1, it would refuse to install/transfer watch faces across from the Connect IQ application and was very temperamentalThe Samsung Active 2 which I also have is far better if you are looking for a watch which is \"smarter\" but not as good as the Garmin for exercise stuff. It has a vastly superior screen.Overall, rather disappointed by the experience, I'm not sure this smart watch is actually ready as there are too many little niggles and annoyances with the screen and software.",
            "I am upgrading from the Garmin Vivoactive HR and decided on the Venu mainly due to the display. I found it increasingly difficult to read the display on the Vivoactive and heard the Bright Touchscreen on the Venu would be a good upgrade. The watch comes with a lot more widgets and apps than the old one, and the interface is slightly quirkier to get round. The display is bright and easily readable. The animations are a good touch and make for a more interesting view. So far, my activities have been limited to walking and some weights at home. The walking mode is spoiled by the time it takes to activate the GPS. My old watch would take about 20 - 30 seconds this one takes up to 5 minutes to get a connection. Why? Not sure but it does let the whole package down slightly. Otherwise, it would be 5 stars. The battery life is what I would expect from Garmin and far superior to any other watch I have used. I like to view the walks I have done afterwards and the Garmin Connect on the web is a great and to me essential touch. Hear I can view all the stats and customize the look of the page to show only the items I am interested in. If the Venu lasts as long as my Vivoactive then I will be very happy.",
            "Despu\u00e9s de usar un vivoactive 3 durante casi dos a\u00f1os me hab\u00eda habituado al ecosistema de garmin y quer\u00eda repetir con otro de sus dispositivos, por esa raz\u00f3n aqu\u00ed estoy, contando mi experiencia con este nuevo reloj de garmin (durante solo un d\u00eda, es lo que tard\u00e9 en decidirme a devolverlo).Est\u00e9ticamente es bonito, no se puede negar y hasta aqu\u00ed sus virtudes.Pantalla:Particularmente me gusta mirar al reloj y encontrarme con la hora sin tener que hacer ejercicios de contorsionismo con la mu\u00f1eca, no obstante podr\u00eda haber vivido con ello, nunca viene mal ejercitar la flexibilidad. Lo que me hace menos gracia es no poder ver con claridad los campos de datos, que por cierto solo se visualizar\u00e1n 3 como m\u00e1ximo, durante mis entrenamientos, adem\u00e1s de por su tama\u00f1o tambi\u00e9n porque la pantalla brilla poco, al menos si est\u00e1 configurada para estar siempre encendida durante una actividad.En cualquier caso la pantalla cuando estas interaccionando, dicho sea de paso es bastante imprecisa, con ella o miras la hora (despu\u00e9s de tu sesi\u00f3n de ejercicios de mu\u00f1eca) se ve suficientemente bien.Precisi\u00f3n del posicionamiento (GPS):Un absoluto horror. Entreno en una pista de atletismo y lo que se supone deber\u00eda de ser un ovalo....parec\u00eda...si ok, un ovalo pero pintado por un ni\u00f1o de 2 a\u00f1os, configurado con el gps + glonass, tal como viene por defecto.Sincronizaci\u00f3n con garmin connect:Este apartado es otro absoluto desprop\u00f3sito, mientras que mi antiguo vivoactive tardaba apenas unos segundos en sincronizar un entrenamiento este venu..yo no se ni el tiempo que tard\u00f3, fue desesperante, eso si, termin\u00f3 haci\u00e9ndolo.Puls\u00f3metro:Yo creo que no va mal del todo, lo que pasa que yo muevo mucho los brazos en mis entrenamientos y no es nada preciso, nunca he probado un reloj que lo fuese conmigo.Bater\u00eda:Dir\u00eda que esto es lo peor de todo. Cargu\u00e9 el reloj la noche anterior al \u00fanico entreno que realic\u00e9 con \u00e9l, por la ma\u00f1ana estaba al 95%, me pareci\u00f3 correcto, pero al terminar de entrenar (despu\u00e9s de 1 hora y 45 minutos aproximadamente) ya contaba con un 73% de capacidad, lo que me habr\u00eda supuesto tener que cargarlo cada dos d\u00edas, en un a\u00f1o lo mismo tengo que cargarlo todos los d\u00edas...no lo veo yo claro.Conclusiones.En general tienes la sensaci\u00f3n cuando lo usas que es un producto en el que se ha recordado much\u00edsimo y que no me lo esperaba despu\u00e9s de haber le\u00eddo unas cuentas reviews antes de adquirirlo. Dicho de forma mas sencilla, se nota un dispositivo mal concebido, de baja calidad si lo prefer\u00eds.Teniendo en cuenta de que vas a pagar cerca de 200\u20ac por \u00e9l y ya habiendo mencionado todos estos defectos que yo encontr\u00e9, que considero capitales, no me parece que sea una buena inversi\u00f3n en absoluto, por poco mas te puedes comprar un 245 que muy previsiblemente funcionar\u00e1 much\u00edsimo mejor, todo esto teniendo en cuenta de que quien se compra un garmin es porque le gusta el deporte.",
            "I've been a longstanding Garmin customer for a few years and have had fenix 6s as well as this watch so I think I'm in a position to make an honest from comparable comparison. I guess the pros to the venuel is the fact that it's extremely light and you don't even notice it on your wrist compared to the phoenix that was like a tank and weighed nearly 100 g and always felt very heavy.  The venu has very good battery life typically from normal use as well as basic navigation back to a hotel so you typically get between 3 to 4 days unlike some whates such as the Samsung watch 4 for which I had literally would give me 48 hours at a very maximum so top marks the Garmin for the battery life. To watch itself is pretty good it's not as probably as feature full as a Samsung watch but it does give you your health age as well as runs a bunch of diagnostics to test HRV blood pressure fitness levels etc etc and does a pretty good job of this. The Garmin connect app is excellent and works seamlessly with the watch and is not always requesting to pair with the watch and you can set it in such a way that you just open the app periodically to download the data which is far better for the watches battery life.I use the watch for fishing quite a bit and it's fully waterproof I've been out to Madeira fishing recently and it's water to proof and salt proof and I've had no issues with that although I don't use it for diving. I found it hard to get a screen protector to protect the watch as it has a slight curvature on the screen so you can only really use the plastic silicone covers which are not hard glass or in any way as effective as a proper screen protecter say for the fenix 6r.I guess the cons to this watch the main reason is the fact that it does not have maps and does not have built in decent navigation where you can actually go for a hike and add a GPX route to the watch in order to get a basic trail.  It does allow some form of navigation where you can store navigation point say your base or your home and it will give you an arrow pointer towards that set location but it will not allow you to import a trail that someone else's walked and follow that trail but I guess that is why it costs significantly less than the fenix 6 and it is as I say a fitness watch and not really a navigation hiking watch.Overall I'm pretty pleased to watch I've had a bunch of smart watches and I must say this is the best for the money and it feels really good on the wrist and not very heavy and has most of the features that I would like I think if I had to criticize it as I say it will be having navigation with maps would make it an awesome contender for best smartwatchThanks",
            "The watch itself for me was an upgrade from the Garmin Forerunner 235. It\u2019s touch screen and looks great. Garmin are an excellent fitness watch range. I use it mainly for running however it does have other activities in it you can do. I\u2019ve not investigated too much into other features to be fair other than change the watch face which is very easy to do. You can have messages on it from a smart phone however you cannot reply like a Samsung or Apple one.There was one time I was doing a tough mudder and it sent it into a hissy fit twice wanting to make an emergency call for whatever reason but I\u2019ve still not found out why.Overall, it\u2019s a great device and looks great. The accuracy is excellent, it\u2019s easy to use, and I\u2019m sure you would love it also",
            "Premetto che ho comprato il Garmin Venu 2 per sostituire un Apple Watch 3 che improvvisamente si \u00e8 rotto, pertanto tutti i paragoni saranno fatti con questo ultimo. Ho scelto il Venu 2 dopo lunghe ricerche e pensando soprattutto all'utilizzo che faccio dello smartwatch. Faccio quotidianamente sport (CrossFit, corsa, padel, tennis) e mi piace avere tutti i dati possibili relativi ai vari allenamenti e forse per questo avrei dovuto prendere un Forerunner o Fenix, ma avevo paura dell'integrazione con l'iPhone che per me \u00e8 molto importante (messaggi, notifiche, email, et\u00e0.) Per questo la scelta \u00e8 caduta sul modello Garmin che ritenevo pi\u00f9 simile a Apple Watch per la parte smartwatch senza rinunciare a molto sulla parte sportwatch.Veniamo alla recensione.Inizio subito ad elencare le cose che mi piacciono molto del Venu 2:1) durata della batteria: niente a che vedere con AW. Anche se non arriva ai valori dichiarati la durata \u00e8 comunque molto buona, ci faccio tranquillamente 4/5 giorni facendo almeno 1 ora di attivit\u00e0 al giorno e con il pulsossimetro attivo tutta la notte. Molto rapida anche la ricarica.2) Estetica e comodit\u00e0: a me piace molto la sua estetica ed \u00e8 confortevole da indossare per tutto il giorno e durante la notte; non lo si sente neanche al polso.3) Molto utili i pulsanti per avviare/stoppare una attivit\u00e0: purtroppo con l'Apple Watch mi \u00e8 capitato varie volte che durante gli allenamenti di CrossFit l'attivit\u00e0 entrasse in pausa o si stoppasse o per via del sudore che cade sul display o per aver premuto inavvertitamente il pulsante laterale con il polso (costringendomi ad indossarlo sul polso destro per evitare questo problema). Tutto questo con Venu 2 non succede.4) Garmin Connect: molto ben fatto, consente di avere tutte insieme una serie di informazioni complete sulla attivit\u00e0 fisica, sul sonno e molto altro ancora. Il body battery \u00e8 forse l'indicazione che mi \u00e8 piaciuta di pi\u00f9 e devo dire che l'ho anche trovata molto accurata. Quelle notti in cui non ho dormito bene il livello non si \u00e8 caricato moltissimo, e devo dire che il valore indicato riportava la mia sensazione sul mio stato fisico. Anche eventuali pause giornaliere servono ad aumentare il valore del boss battery. Molto utile anche l'indicazioni delle zone di lavoro cardiache per ogni attivit\u00e0.Passiamo a cosa non mi ha convinto molto:1) accuratezza lettore pulsazioni cardiache: fino a quando non ho giocato a tennis ho pensato che l'accuratezza fosse a livello del sensore di AW, da tutti riconosciuto come il pi\u00f9 veritiero. Infatti anche negli allenamenti di CrossFit che sono difficili da monitorare per via dei continui picchi e per l'utilizzo che si fa del polso, ho sempre riscontrato dei valori assolutamente plausibili ed in linea con le misurazioni fatte con AW (mentre devo dire che il Polar Verity Sense che ho restituito in moltissimi frangenti non riusciva a misurare nessuna pulsazione). Sono rimasto soddisfatto anche delle misurazioni durante la corsa e nel padel. Non capisco come, con queste premesse, la misurazione durante un leggerissimo allenamento di tennis siano state completamente sballate (preciso che ho usato la funzione cardio non essendo il tennis presente tra gli sport monitorati). Anche se ho tenuto il Venu 2 sul braccio in cui non tengo la racchetta (e quindi non soggetto a sollecitazioni e vibrazioni) le pulsazioni sono sempre state esagerate, addirittura dopo un semplice palleggio \u00e8 arrivato a segnarmi 172 pulsazioni al minuto (quando misurate manualmente erano sotto le 90). La misurazione non \u00e8 mai scesa sotto le 150 pulsazioni. Evidentemente il tennis ha qualcosa di particolare perch\u00e9 lo stesso problema l'ho riscontrato anche con il Polar Verity Sense, mentre l'Apple Watch \u00e8 stato l'unico a darmi delle misurazioni a mio parere corrette (per un allenamento similare il range era tra 80 e 125 pulsazioni). A riposo le misurazioni in continua appaiono corrette. E' stato solo il tennis a creare problemi.2) rilevazione attivit\u00e0: non pretendo di avere il rilevamento automatico delle attivit\u00e0 come in AW, ma \u00e8 abbastanza curioso che durante una passeggiata in bicicletta, dopo oltre un'ora che pedalavo, anche se a ritmo blando, mi sia arrivata la segnalazione \"\u00e8 l'ora di alzarsi e fare un po' di moto\" come se fino a quel momento fossi stato seduto sul divano o alla scrivania a lavorare. Va bene che in bici non fai oscillare il braccio con l'orologio, ma mi sembra veramente eccessivo.3) possibilit\u00e0 di personalizzazione: i dati presenti nell'orologio sono molti e ben rappresentati, intuitivi da leggere e sufficientemente affidabili (vedi considerazioni precedenti). Il fatto \u00e8 che esistono veramente poche possibilit\u00e0 di personalizzazione. Non si pu\u00f2 scaricare quasi niente di veramente utile dal ConnectIQ (per esempio mi sarebbe piaciuto avere un qualcosa di specifico per il tennis/padel in cui riporta velocit\u00e0 del braccio, tipi di colpi tirati etc, come accadeva con AW).Cosa non mi \u00e8 piaciuto per niente:1) watch faces: quelle di serie le ho trovate a dir poco imbarazzanti. Per fortuna tramite ConnectIQ se ne possono scegliere altre (poche a dire il vero) per migliorare l'aspetto del vostro Watch. Mi sarei aspettato qualcosa di pi\u00f9.2) integrazione con iPhone: faccio un uso intenso del mio iPhone e speravo nel poter avere maggiori funzionalit\u00e0 riportate nel Venu 2. Una cosa che mi ha lasciato molto perplesso \u00e8 che se orologio e telefono non sono molto vicini (cosa che pu\u00f2 capitare se lasci il cellulare sotto carica) non sono assolutamente connessi tra di loro (pur avendo impostato la stessa rete wi-fi su entrambi). Ero abituato con AW ad avere collegamento con il cellulare anche uscendo di casa (bastava essere sotto copertura wi-fi). Cos\u00ec facendo sono sempre costretto a lasciare la suoneria attiva sul telefono perch\u00e9 se lo lascio in carica e vado in un'altra stanza, se arriva una telefonata l'orologio non vibra assolutamente, con il rischio di perdere la chiamata. Mi manca anche la possibilit\u00e0 di rispondere con messaggi brevi agli sms e a whatsapp (so che \u00e8 una limitazione imposta da Apple, ma a me manca lo stesso); con il Venu 2 sono costretto a tirare sempre fuori il telefono, sbloccarlo e rispondere al messaggio. Mi manca anche la possibilit\u00e0 di sbloccare il cellulare con la mascherina ed il FaceId senza dover digitare il codice (ovvio che Garmin non c'entra niente).3) durante i workout non arriva nessuna segnalazione: per me \u00e8 importante ricevere segnalazioni (email, messaggi, etc) quando sto facendo attivit\u00e0. Un rapido sguardo e posso decidere se sono importanti oppure no e continuare il mio esercizio. Con il Venu 2 tutto questo non si pu\u00f2 fare.Considerazioni finali:e qui veniamo alla spiegazione del titolo: vale la spesa? La mia opinione \u00e8 che il Venu 2 sia un qualcosa di ibrido tra smartwatch e sportwatch che cerca di strizzare l'occhio ad una vasta platea, senza per\u00f2 riuscire a convincere nessuno. Se ho esigenze specifiche (esempio triatlon) sicuramente ci sono sportwatch pi\u00f9 completi (come Forerunner per restare in casa Garmin), se invece ho bisogno di uno smartwatch trovo che non sia assolutamente a livello di Apple Watch che continua ad essere una scelta migliore in questo specifico ambito. Penso anche che 360\u20ac per questo orologio siano troppi, soprattutto se confrontati con i 309\u20ac di un AW SE o anche i 439 di AW ultima serie. E' vero che per avere gli stessi dati che il Venu 2 mi fornisce per l'attivit\u00e0 fisica ho bisogno di installare delle applicazioni aggiuntive sull'AW (alcune anche a pagamento, anche se si tratta di pochi euro), ma \u00e8 altrettanto vero che sul dispositivo Apple la possibilit\u00e0 di installare nuove funzioni \u00e8 limitata solo dalla fantasia degli sviluppatori.Resta il discorso della durata della batteria, neanche paragonabile.Per tutto quanto sopra descritto non ho ancora deciso se tenere il Venu 2 oppure tornare ad Apple Watch. Aggiorner\u00f2 questa lunga recensione quando avr\u00f2 deciso.",
            "I am really pleased with this. The SQ is a good mix between a smart-watch and fitness tracker. I am keen cyclist, so most of my data is downloaded from my bike GPS computer via the Garmin app. I use the SQ to track my commute and walks- so all the data comes together in the Garmin app. Battery life is great- about 7 days with 10 commute bike trips and 5 walks with GPS. Starting the GPS is a breeze, and the signal is found quickly. Occasionally the emergency contact feature has gone off - think the sensitivity is too strong- but it is easy enough to cancel. There are some apps that make it a decent smart watch- linking to smart bulbs etc to able to turn the lights off at night with a swipe is good. Notifications come through with no issues from a Samsung phone. I can leave my phone pretty much on silent now. Heart rate data is accurate- compared to a Wahoo fitness tracker. Steps seem consistent- but I don't know how accurate- good to use as a relative measure day to day though. GPS tracking is accurate and simple. Like how functions can be started and stopped with buttons- especially on cold days when I am wearing gloves. Overall, very pleased. Good price- not too expensive it makes me terrified of wearing it on a bike, but has enough features to keep me entertained. Would recommend. Had for 2 months now, and no issues.",
            "Ok I've owned a lot of smart watches: Apple Watch 44mm Nike Cellular, Huawei Watch 2, Fitbit Versa, Fitbit Versa 2, FitBit Sense, Galaxy Watch 2 42mm, Fossil Sport, Fossil Gen 5. Overall the best out of all of these was the Apple Watch for sure but it came with some drawbacks like battery life.Starting with my use case: I want a good fitness tracker, good battery life, a nice screen and notifications on my wrist. I don't care about apps on my watch as long as it vibrates when I get a message or call I'm happy.The Garmin Venu 2 is perfect. I've owned it for over a week and I've only just had to charge it. Honestly I don't know how it's able to do everything it does and have that amount of battery life. 10 days with normal use is insane!!It's been great at counting steps and mapping my walks so far (need to increase the exercise routines). I love that I can save the animated workouts to my watch as well.It's comfortable, light weight and does everything I need it to do.Biggest question: do I rate it higher than the Apple watch? Yes with a but. I don't think I ever took full advantage of the Apple watch. It was great but I just don't care about apps at all. The only thing the Apple watch had over this is a more distinct vibration on my wrist.If this was to break I would buy another one because it's so amazing. Garmin have really shocked me with this watch!!Just buy one it's brilliant.",
            "Mein erstes Fazit nach einer Woche ist sehr gut. Die Venu SQ erf\u00fcllt genau die Dinge f\u00fcr die ich mir die Uhr gekauft habe. Dabei sollte man aber einige Dinge beachten und vorher wissen welche Anspr\u00fcche man selber hat.Da ich nie ein Uhrentr\u00e4ger war, habe ich mir nur f\u00fcr den Sport zun\u00e4chst eine Forerunner 45 gekauft, mit der ich \u00fcberraschend viel Spa\u00df hatte. Da ich die Uhr dann gerne \u00f6fter getragen h\u00e4tte, mir das Design und die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe daf\u00fcr aber nicht passend war, habe ich die Venu gekauft.Garmin App: Ich kann nicht viele Vergleichswerte liefern aber die Art und Weise wie L\u00e4ufe und Aktivit\u00e4ten getrackt werden \u00fcberzeugt mich.Design: Die Venu SQ war die einzige Uhr mit der Standard Venu, welche mir nicht entweder zu gro\u00df (~45 mm) oder zu klein(~39 mm) war. Damit erf\u00fcllt die Uhr einen f\u00fcr mich entscheidenden Wunsch. letztendlich entscheidet die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und das Design ja dar\u00fcber wie oft man die Uhr tr\u00e4gt, das wird bei allen Tests oft vergessen. Sollte man aber beachten.Display: Hier war ich aufgrund der Tests sehr skeptisch, da es viel Kritik gab. Dazu muss ich sagen ich habe keinen Vergleich zu besseren AMOLED Displays. Trotzdem, oder gerade wegen der negativen Kommentare , wurde ich positiv \u00fcberrascht. Das Display ist gut, und vorallem reagiert es bisher top wenn ich nach oben oder unten wische. Auch die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe ist f\u00fcr mich ausreichend.GPS: weicht manchmal leicht von den Ergebnissen der Forerunner ab, ist f\u00fcr mich als reiner Hobby L\u00e4ufer aber irrelevant ( 30 Meter unterschied bei 7 km L\u00e4ufen).Akku: In der ersten Woche (viel mit der Uhr rumgespielt und ausgetestet) kam ich 5 volle Tage mit der Uhr zurecht und hatte dann noch 20 Prozent. Dabei habe ich jeden Tag mindestens eine halbe Stunde das GPS zum Laufen genutzt.Fazit:Wer auf der Suche nach einer Alltagstauglichen Smartwatch ist, bei der der Fokus auf Tracking von Sport und Fitness liegt ist hier richtig. Die Uhr ist ein Allrounder wobei ich denke dass man von Spielereien wie Blutsauerstoff etc nicht zuviel erwarten sollte.",
            "Bought for my son and used this watch for a while now.The main reason I bought this rather than a lesser brand such as amazfit (I alps recently bought the gtr 2e for myself which I really love) is the sports modes and data.Yes, a lot of smart watches/activity trackers track the activities, but talking about sporta data, garmin is still the best.My son is very active especially swimming, we'd like him to start thinking more of his training plan and using data to help him.The battery lasts about a week depending on usage, and it's quite comfortable wearing it.Happy son = happy parents",
            "After graduating from the trusty Forerunner 235, I was looking for something with a nicer interface, preferably touchscreen and greater accuracy on the GPS.After pricing a few higher end models, I decided to the give the Venu 2 a go, as it was new on the market and got very good reviews.Absolutely excellent so far in all regards. Notifications are perfect, touch screen is flawless, love the vibrant colours of the screen. I love how customiz-able it is - i.e. your selected colours, features etc.Accuracy on the GPS is excellent - I also have a Wahoo Elemnt Bolt for my bicycle, and they are virtually identical in their data analysis. Slight difference on the heart rate reading compared to my chest strap but not a major difference, still detects when I am increasing my effort.Only problem, if you could even call it that, was failure to connect with Zwift (as I was looking to use it as a HR monitor) but I could equally blame Zwift as much here.Worth every penny.",
            "I'm not really a fitness user: more interested in getting wrist-based notifications and texts, and in pulse rate, than in step count. Which is fortunate, because I can spend the entire day walking in my garden, plant to plant and up and down the paths, and get a count about half what my Fitbit records.  Out walking, where I tend to step out with a long stride, the two more or less agree.  I'm reserving judgement on its value as a phone connectivity tool: the Fitbit is very iffy about synching, especially if I have WiFi and VPN running (which is usually); so far the Garmin has been reasonable, though it does sometimes do a frantic catch-up and tell me stuff which I know is at least two hours old (despite being beside the phone the whole time).Looks-wise, it's a bit 'meh': square and blocky.  But that's the price-point; and I'm not blowing a fortune to get something prettier unless I'm stone-cold certain it will deliver instant updates and an accurate step count.  So for now, I'll be a Garmin Girl.",
            "Zuerst die positiven Dinge.Sehr gut und ausgesprochen genau funktioniert die GPS-Erfassung von Aktivit\u00e4ten, bis auf Ausnahmen die Herzfrequernzmessung und Sauerstoffs\u00e4ttigung und Musikwiedergabe \u00fcber Bluetooth-Kopfh\u00f6hrer ohne das Smartphone dabei zu haben. Der Akku h\u00e4lt bei meinem Nutzungsumfang i.d.R. 3 Tage, was im Vergleich zum Mittbewerb recht gut ist. Das Display ist klar und auch im Freien gut ablesbar und bisher hat die Smartwatch auch alle Wasseraktivit\u00e4ten schadlos \u00fcberstanden. Wenn man einmal die Logik hiter der Bedienung verstanden hat, funktioniert die Navigation \u00fcber das Touchdiplay sehr zuverl\u00e4ssig.Nun zu dem, was die Smartwatch massiv entwertet, wenn nicht gar f\u00fcr einen Teil der Nutzer in weiten Teilen unbrauchbar macht.Obwohl Garmin das Ger\u00e4t mit \"erweiterter Schlafanalyse (Advanced Sleep Monitoring = ASM)\" unter Mitverwendung des optischen Sensors bewirbt und dazu extra noch einen \"Sleepscore\" berechnet, ist es die schlechteste und ungenaueste Schlafmessung, die ich je bei einem Fitnessarmband oder Smartwatch erlebt habe. Da Garmin nicht in der Lage ist mehrere Schlafabschnitte am gleichen Tag zu erfassen, ist diese Smartwatch f\u00fcr Menschen wie mich, die im Schichtdienst und/oder Bereitschaftsdienst arbeiten, sich ihre Gesamtschlafzeit also st\u00fcckweise erschlafen m\u00fcssten absolut unbrauchbar!Das Witzige daran ist, das die Smartwatch w\u00e4hrend der unterschlagenen Schlafzeiten die sogenannte \"Body-Battery\" wieder hochz\u00e4hlt, sensorisch also sehrwohl in der Lage ist diese Schlafzeiten zu erfassen, man es aber in der Auswertesoftware schlicht nicht vorgesehen hat diese auszuwerten und den Fakt zu ber\u00fccksichtigen, dass es eben nicht nur Menschen mit \"Bilderbuch-Schlafzeiten\" gibt. (siehe angeh\u00e4ngte Bilder, rote K\u00e4sten sind eigene Anmerkungen zur Erkl\u00e4rung)Jedes mir bekannte Billig-Fitnessarmband ist inzwischen in der Lage, einen oder mehrere Kurzschlafzeiten \u00fcber den Tag (z.B. einen Mittagschlaf) zu erfassen und auf die Gesamtschlafzeit anzurechnen. In den entsprechenden Apps wird das dann als \"Power-Nap\" oder \"Nickerchen\" ausgewiesen.Da ich nicht glauben konnte, dass ein f\u00fchrendes Unternehmen wie Garmin dazu nicht f\u00e4hig sein sollte (gerade wo sie die Schlafanalyse so hochtrabend bewerben), wandte ich mich mit entsprechender Frage an den Support:\"Guten Tag, leider musste ich nach dem Kauf feststellen, das das Ger\u00e4t offenbar nicht in der Lage ist, mehrere Schlafabschnitte \u00fcber die Nacht/Tag zu erkennen und auszuwerten. Ich hatte das Ger\u00e4t insbesondere wegen der hochgelobten Schlafanalyse gekauft. Da selbst meine Vorg\u00e4ngerger\u00e4te, selbst billigster \"China-Marke\" in der Lage waren, mehrere Kurzschlafe zu erkennen und korrekt auszuwerten, finde ich es f\u00fcr eine Premium-Marke schon besch\u00e4mend, das man eine solche Funktion nicht anbietet, obwohl man mit \"erweiterter Schlafanalyse\" wirbt. Es gibt viele Kunden, die, wie ich, aufgrund beruflicher Anforderungen (Bereitschaftsdienst) sehr unregelm\u00e4\u00dfige Schlafzeiten haben und ihre Schlafpensum aus mehrenen Kurz-Schl\u00e4fchen \"zusammenst\u00fcckeln\" m\u00fcssen. In der Software, selbst einfacher Ger\u00e4te wie einer Amazfit-Watch oder Mi-Band, werden diese dann als \"Nickerchen\" erfasst und auf die Gesamtschlafenszeit angerechnet. Sieht sich Garmin in der Lage, kurzfristig eine solche Standardf\u00e4higkeit in ihre Software zu integrieren? \"Sehr schnell erhielt ich folgende Antwort:\"vielen Dank f\u00fcr Ihre Anfrage. Leider haben Sie Recht und das ist aktuell nicht m\u00f6glich.Es kann nur eine Schlafphase erfasst und analysiert werden.Wir bedanken uns allerdings f\u00fcr Ihr Feedback und haben Ihr Anliegen als Verbesserungsvorschlag an die US-Entwickler und an die dortigen Produktverantwortlichen weitergeleitet, bitten jedoch um Verst\u00e4ndnis daf\u00fcr, dass wir nicht absch\u00e4tzen k\u00f6nnen, ob entsprechende \u00c4nderungen implementiert werden und, falls ja, wann und in welcher Form. Nat\u00fcrlich sind wir aber der Meinung, dass das ein n\u00fctzliches Feature ist und auf jeden Fall implementiert werden sollte.\"Das war Mitte August, seither hat sich in der Richtung (erwartungsgem\u00e4\u00df) nicht ver\u00e4ndert und ich glaube auch kaum mehr daran. Der Kunde hat ja schon gekauft, da ist der Antrieb regelm\u00e4\u00dfig gering.Letzlich v\u00f6llig nutzlos ist die Garmin-Pay Funktion, da (au\u00dfer der Commerzbank) keine der gro\u00dfen Banken diesen Alleingang unterst\u00fctzt. Lediglich eine Handvoll Fintechs wie VimPay, Revolut, Transferwise und sonstige hat man ins Boot bekommen, die wohl nur die Wenigsten in Deutschland kennen, geschweige denn nutzen. Warum man sich nicht an Googlepay/Applepay anh\u00e4ngt, die inzwischen so gut wie jede Bank unterst\u00fczen und auf Krampf das Rad neu erfinden muss, ist nicht nachvollziehbar.Letztlich \u00e4rgere ich mich ma\u00dflos, dass ich \u00fcber 300 Euro f\u00fcr eine Smartwatch in den Sand gesetzt habe,  welche eine elementare Grundfunktion nicht beherrscht und mich daf\u00fcr von jedem Besitzer eines Billigst-Fitnesstrackers bel\u00e4cheln lassen muss.",
            "This is my first smart watch and it has definitely encouraged me to be more active and take an interest in my health. I love all the functions it has from storing music to blue tooth connection so I get messages to my watch and I can send one line replies without going on my phone. I also like that it can track different activities from weightlifting to cardio to yoga, pilates and even swimming. It gives reminders when you are sedentary for too long. I haven't used the sleep tracker yet because I don't like to have any active devices on me while asleep. The battery lasts a good 4-5 days depending on what functions I use for example have bluetooth on constantly, listening to music etc.There a couple of things I'm bummed out about with the Garmin Venu SQ:1. I can't use my HSBC cards on Garmin Pay2. I'm not a huge fan of the strap as it feels a bit cheap. (Obviously you can find replacement or even other bands on Amazon that you can use with Venu SQ.All in all I am mostly satisfied with this smart watch. It would get a perfect score if I am able to pay using Garmin Pay.",
            "Birthday gift from my partner and family.This is an amazing smart watch that has all the features of the flagship models from other vendors. I especially love the sleep tracking, it's very accurate.But it beats all the other vendors in one area. Battery life.I can get 10 days out of this thing between charges and judging from others when I start running / biking again the near future I should still get 5-6 days with GPS tracking enabled for those events.I'm blown away and would recommend it to anyone.",
            "So as a runner there is a lot of hype about Garmin so thought I'd give it a try. Shouldn't have bothered.  The good points being the Garmin app is fantastic, it shows some serious data and all for free unlike fitbit.The problems I've had are, in 2 weeks of owning the watch, it's failed to save workouts twice, it's paused automatically mid run for no reason, it's also quit the activity mid run again for no reason, it's almost like the watch doesn't have enough memory then gives up.I'd avoid this one, I'm gonna try and return.",
            "Bought this on a friend\u2019s recommendation after using cheaper devices a few times and not being happy. This is a brilliant piece of kit, the app is easy to use, I find the recording very accurate and battery life is excellent. Works well with my iPhone, didn\u2019t want to pay the price for an Apple Watch when this does everything I need it to. My one complaint, which lost it a star, is after having it for a few weeks I went to London at the weekend and was walking around for a large part of the day and when I took the watch off to shower I noticed it had rubbed the skin on part of my wrist. This may be my fault as I had the strap on a slightly looser setting as sometimes my hands swell a little in the heat when I\u2019m walking so I did it a little looser to accommodate. It didn\u2019t feel like it was loose enough to be rubbing but presume it must have been.",
            "Da ich bereits von der Venu (1. Generation) hinsichtlich einer Akkulaufzeit von 6 Tagen recht angetan war, hier jedoch das Finden einer GPS-Position bis zu eine Minute lang gedauert hat, habe ich in die Venu 2s gro\u00dfe Erwartungen gesteckt.Pro: Das Display und das gesamte neue Layout sind wirklich toll geraten. Das GPS wird schnell gefunden und das Tracking funktioniert sehr genau. Die oftmals ge\u00e4u\u00dferte Kritik, dass die Men\u00fcf\u00fchrung sehr irref\u00fchrend sei, kann ich nicht nachvollziehen.Kontra: Selbst bei Verwendung der von Garmin ver\u00f6ffentlichten Einstellungen, die angeblich eine Akkulaufzeit von bis zu 10 Tagen erm\u00f6glichten sollten, war bei mir der Akku bereits nach 4 Tagen ersch\u00f6pft - dies sind sogar zwei Tage weniger, als die Venu der 1. Generation geliefert hat; auch ein mehrmaliges Zur\u00fccksetzen der Uhr brachte keine Verbesserung. Ein weiteres Manko ist, dass das in der Werbung so hoch gepriesene Anzeigen des Fitnessalters bei meiner Uhr nicht funktioniert hat - weder in der Garmin Connect App (hier erschien immer die Meldung \"es ist ein Fehler aufgetreten\"), noch auf der Website von Garmin Connect.Da f\u00fcr mich die Akkulaufzeit von bis zu 10 Tagen (laut Garmin) ein schlagendes Argument f\u00fcr den Kauf war, die bei meinem Exemplar nicht einmal ann\u00e4hernd erreicht wurden, werde ich sie zur\u00fccksenden.",
            "So far I'm pretty impressed with this. I've had a few \"fitness smart watches\" over the years now. I've come from the Samsung active 2 which was dreadful for fitness tracking capabilities. The garmin app is great and the tracking of the watch seems to be great also. For the price however I would of liked a little more smart watch capabilities but I'm more focused on the tracking. I would recommend this watch to anyone who is looking to track their active lifestyle.",
            "Finally I find a sport health watch that does not require you to pay any extras maybe you will not be able to answer messages I make phone calls but I don't care I'm really very happy in the face of Fitbit Apple and Samsung",
            "Fab product. Looks super smart and have one spare hole left on strap for my small wrist.Love the choice of watch faces you can download or create from the app. Yet to master how to get the downloaded running / swimming apps onto the watch - early days.Easy to use and having been used to a Fitbit a it\u2019s sleep tracking is similar but defo different in how long I\u2019ve been awake etc.Steps are literally actually steps. Cycling with a Fitbit would generate steps to overall daily total\u2026. Bike handle vibrations. This watch - nope - proper actual tracking!It does auto track a walk / cycle / run etc - but it doesn\u2019t give you any further data like a Fitbit would- which is a shame.You therefore have to actually track / start the watch for the activity of you want to look into distance etc.As a runner - I\u2019m working on my cadence - this is easily viewed now on my chosen running screen.Great for swimming too as I no longer have to count lengths - which would hurt my brain in every session \ud83d\ude2cLights in the dark - sometimes disturb me if my wrist and angle shows the watch trying to scan. Guess the round face makes it easier to see / for light to escape.So - Just a few couple of things I miss from the fitbit world - plus the step networks / challenges etc but I will learn to live without it and judge my own progress with the garmin and Strava app. Defo counts exercise calories far more accurately. Fitbit always over estimate!!Price fluctuates - paid 207\u00a3 - wouldn\u2019t pay much more for it - but a \u00a3200 price tag for it is a fair deal!!I love my watch and feel like this is more negative than positive - but it shouldn\u2019t be. Oh and one other down side - battery life - lasts 3\u2019days max if using to track about 90min of exercise a day.",
            "Absolutely love  this watch.  Bought to replace a fitbit blaze which no longer holds its charge.This was easy to set up, looks good and the price is even better.I had considered an Apple Watch SE but this does virtually the same things so why would I pay more for something that doesn't really do anything extra?Battery life is pretty good, haven't had the 6 days battery life - probably because I use it to track exercise every day.If you're considering this go for it, you'll be more than happy.",
            "I primarily wanted a watch to use for golf, running and general health & activity tracking.I returned a Huawei GT2 watch due to issues I had with it's heart rate monitor and chose this as it's replacement.The Venu doesn't have the quality look and feel of the Huawei, but it is acceptable to me.It seems to either work as a metric or imperial measurement device which is inconvenient as I run and swim in metric and play golf in imperial.  I haven't yet found a way to set up as metric for run/swim and imperial for golf (that's not to say it isn't possibleThe golf function works fine, but defaults to metric yardage.  I am living with this, just add an extra 10% to the distance offered to get the yardage.Running is fine and I feel it does get distance, time and heartrate correct and it does offer a connection to a chest heartrate monitor if required.(which is another reason I chose this watch as my Huawei didn't offer this).The only thing missing is the ability to set up some of the training plans which are available on other Garmin watches.. but for me, as a lite user, something I can live withSwimming is OK, although often seems to have a length added or missing, but that could be down to the swimming that I do (I haven't yet tried all crawl)I don't use the music function, but do find the notification function useful.The screen is easy to read, even when out running, but I have had to increase the brightness to the middle setting.Battery life is OK for me, I usually charge it twice a week and use the GPS 3 times (1x golf and 2xrun) and it charges in a couple of hours.So I don't think the Venu 2 is perfect, but is a decent compromise that gives me most things I want in a single watch.",
            "I'm a big Garmin fan.  I have had a couple of earlier devices, bought this for my son.  He thinks it's great as it looks Apple watch like, has most of the features but only needs charging every few days (3-4 ish)",
            "Hello,Making this 'short' and sweet.- Watch itself is very nice, with a lovely screen- Get access to the Garmin app like on any Garmin watch, with loads of really customizable faces etcBad:- Sleep tracking to truly truly appalling and inaccurate. There is really no point it being there, it doesn't know when you fall asleep or wake up due to it being based on movement (if you sit reading a book, it will think you're asleep).It won't pick up if you wake up in the night unless you move around aggressively.- This makes the body battery pointless. How can it say you're fully charged if it can't measure how well you've sleptSearch the forums before purchasing, a lot of disgruntled buyers. This only requires a software update (which they already have the software for), but have confirmed that they will not be doing it.Would not recommend unless you have no care in the world about tracking your health.CheersJames",
            "I bought this product recently and it crashes 2-3 times per week. Its general functionality i.e. GPS, step count, notifications etc. is pretty decent but the fact it crashes so often is really annoying and I'm having to go the wringer with Garmin support to get any help. Also the blood oxygen readings are very inaccurate, often seeing mid 80s when my finger pulse device is showing 99-100 - as is my wife's Apple Watch -  so for me this renders that functionality completely unreliable. As others have noted the display even when sensitivity is set to high can be tricky and rather annoying to turn on. I have had several Garmin watches  in the past and this is my first bad experience and most expensive mistake to date. I wouldn't recommend.",
            "I was debating whether to get a Withings Scanwatch or a Garmin Vivoactive 4 - I was looking mainly for a watch that could do spot SpO2 readings.As I was looking at the Garmin, the Venu caught my eye with its AMOLED screen.I find it very easy to read in daylight (unlike other smart watches I've had previously) and the ability to change watch faces makes it even easier.Integration with the Connect phone apps is excellent and the health data provided very useful. Readings seem to be accurate (enough for me at any rate) and the GPS tracks very well considering the size of the device.On that note, it's incredibly light and (as I have quite small wrists) not at all obtrusive.I haven't tried Garmin Pay yet, but downloading, listening and controlling music is easy enough and works well. I particular like the Hydration widget and hope for more customisation of that in future software updates.Battery life IS something to look out for if you use more battery draining features (brightness, live faces, screen timeout lengthening etc.). I tend to put mine on charge in the morning whilst in the bathroom and that tops it up enough for me so that I've never been below 50%.All in all, I've absolutely nothing to complain about with this watch and am delighted with the purchase.",
            "I upgraded from a Vivosport and am not disappointed.  The screen is lovely and clear (for my aging eyes), the widgets are useful and provide more info than I was getting on the Vivosport.  I love that I can add more apps, widgets, music and watch faces.  With the watch faces there is so much choice allowing me to choose from data overload to more simplistic designs.  I have no issue with the battery life with the always on display as I do tend to charge my watch everyday whilst I am in the shower.  I also find it charges relatively quickly in this time going from 40% to upper 90's by the time I go to put it back on again.",
            "I am in love with my Garmin Venu! Came from a Vivoactive 3 to Venu and was a \"big step\"!I researched a lot because I was looking for a wearable with music built-in and since I was gonna spend some money went for the Venu instead of Vivoactive 4 because of its incredible AMOLED screen.No regrets at all!!It is gorgeous, great battery life!I struggled a little bit of how to increase the battery life and the settings but there are many reviews and step by step on Youtube.I am not a pro runner so it fits me perfectly.Garmin is ready to beat Apple devices!",
            "This garmin venu sq is an entry level smart watch GPS tracker. It does what it's supposed to sometimes and other times it seems to have a mind of its own. The touchscreen is terrible and the watch has a habit of deleting activities with out me even touching it mid cycle. Other times the watch will show a blue triangle and crash for no reason, this is extremely irritating as you can do a 30 to 60 mile cycle for example and want to upload it to strava and the watch has crashed and deletes the activity. I think if you can't afford a better smart watch and you are not too serious about fitness and using strava connectivity this watch maybe good for you. But if you can afford it go for a better smart watch as this one's pros are outweighed by its cons in my opinion. I loved it at first but now after nearly a year I am considering replacing it with a higher end smart watch as this one frustrates me greatly hence why I am reviewing it 10 months after purchase and I just want to vent about how annoying it is. Lol.",
            "This is a good watch that is only let down by a few issues. It tracks steps and heart rate well and even does a decent job tracking kettlebell swings. After a little while though, it will only count to 30 and quit despite going to 50. The body battery is a gimmick, but fun. Watch faces are good. I had quite a few issues getting to sync I itially and while installing watch faces, but eventually figured out to only install one at a time. Sleep tracking is decent. The watch randomly connects and disconnects sometimes despite my phone being nearby. Notifications work well, I do miss my Samsung's rotating bezel as the touchscreen has mediocre response ability. I'll be testing the running feature soon and may update with those results, but the watch does what it's supposed to and it's light and comfortable. Quite happy even if it's not perfect.",
            "Been wearing for about a month now, and I like it.  I love the Garmin apps, and the \"gamification\" of fitness, whereby it sets you goals and reminds you when you need to \"get moving\" (helpful when I'm sitting for work all day), and will automatically adjust your goals (like steps in the day) based on how you're getting on.  From what I can tell it's accurate, and with only using the GPS for 45-60 minutes a day I think I'm averaging about 5-6 days on a charge (although it's never been below 20%).  My only complaint is I find the screen isn't responsive sometimes. i.e. I turn my wrist, the time screen displays, and then I swipe up (or down) to get to a feature and nothing. It doesn't respond.  It's strange. I can't quite work out why.  Am I starting the swipe outside the \"screen zone\" and it doesn't recognise it? Too heavy? too soft?  Dunno!Would I recommend to a friend? Yes - it's decent value and you get all the Garmin apps etc.  Also ... with my version music can be stored on the phone, which means I don't need to take my phone with me if I want to exercise and listen to music - which is a feature I really like.",
            "cannot connect to home wifi, therefore connecting to Spotify doesn't work.  As a result music can't be used whilst running.  Garmin pay does not work in UK.  also for the last 2 week I cannot connect any longer to GPS whilst running. it just searches for the entire run - im running in parks in central London!!  really poor product.  been on many forums and lots of people are having the same problems - with people not being able to connect to their home wifi being the biggest issue.  Garmin needs to sort this out.  Sending watch back and won't be using Garmin again.",
            "This is a replacement for my previous Garmin Vivoactive HR, which still works, but I bought the Venu for the brighter screen.  Prior to that I had both the Microsoft Band and Band 2, which I liked, before the Band 2 died.  Incidentally, I had to change the strap on the vivo, and so have done so on the Venu as well, in order to avoid the rash which seems common on those straps, but not on the MS Bands.  The Venu has many other functions over the Vivo, but the one that seems to be the most problematic is the Body Battery.  When I first got mine it read 42%, and went rapidly down to 5% during the course of an evening of table tennis and cycling.  And there it stayed for several days (I think 5 is the lowest it can go).  However, I was expecting that, as a few people on the Garmin forum had said that it took a while to kick in, and so it did.  After a week, it has started showing charge after a night's sleep, and is slowly reaching higher levels day by day.  How useful this figure will eventually turn out to be I don't know, but rest assured, it will start to work.  Overall, a nice, if quite pricey, watch.EDIT: May 5th 2021.  Have now had this watch for more than 6 months, and I am still happy with it.  I continue to find that the stress and body battery are better indicators of my sleep effectiveness than I expected.  I have heard some complaints about the HRM not being accurate.  All I can say is that it gives me the same readings as my Polar 10 strap under normal circumstances, like just walking around the house.  As soon as the weather improves a little, I shall be doing some strenuous cycling, and will be able to check it under pressure.  The only issue I have is with the strap.  Currently trying a Milanese steel mesh but I don't feel it keeps it secure.",
            "I bought this to replace my vivoactive 3, due to its shortening battery life. I was impressed with the look functionality and feel of the watch But I found the wrist strap short and did struggle to get a comfortable fit but this was soon sorted.I returned this watch as if failed to sync with my phone numerous resets of the watch and phone didn't help.  With the returns widow closing I didn't want to be left with a faulty product. I checked the message boards and they seemed to suggest issues so the decision was made.I like Garmin products but this was a letdown. Now to look for a new watch.",
            "Honest review here.I am tech savvy, but wow this watch is slow to respond in every way. I set it up and started to use for an hour or so and simple changes I hadade to layout via their clunky app never actually made it to the watch.I tried to use the Garmin pay feature the app wouldn't register any cards I have nor even add a card to the system.There is very limited things you can do with the watch and not much customisation either.I did review the watch before purchasing and expected it to be at the same level as other Garmin products but it is miles away.Had 3 hours with it and it's going back.",
            "Brought this primarily for activity tracking of walking and cycling with the intention of taking up running later in the year. For activity tracking Venu 2 is just the ticket. With GPS and a longer battery life than most comparable trackers, it has made obtaining metrics so much easier. I am now trying to find a way to tie in my Withings scale data with Garmin Venu 2 metrics. In which case I will have all the data I need currently to achieve my fitness goals. The bonus with this tracker is that it offers some smart watch features and looks nicer (to me) than other trackers I have considered. I did also consider other Garmin trackers with GPS for only activity metrics without smartwatch features and with hindsight they would have served just as well and at a considerably lower price. Just one niggle in that I cannot keep watch on 24/7 as the silicone strap starts to irritate after a while (probably the case with all watches so not peculiar to Garmin). All in all though I am very happy with my purchase.",
            "The Venu 2 is a great all-round fitness watch, offering those that want to access fitness stats and health tracking without going into crazy depths.The watch software is responsive and intuitive, the screen clear and bright. Battery life is also good, I've my watch face set to always on, only turning off between 1am & 6am, and I get a solid 3 days of battery. The face I have is quite busy so doesn't haver acres of unused space.Accuracy is good too, again this is a general watch, but copes will tracking your location and activity.Sleep, body battery, pulse ox tracking is also improved by the new sensor.The watch is quite light, I was surprised by this - a nod to the non-metal casing. You get used to it too.Only downside, the charging interface - I wish Garmin would develop a magnetic flat charging system. Of course, if you buy a Garmin compatible charging dock you can wave good by to the short cable and \"on-the-side\" charging position.",
            "Only had this about three days but growing to love it. Initial impressions on playing with it out of the box after the ease of setup of fitbit was 'what have I done?' but that changed as I started to learn how to change it to suit what I wanted. It is a techy's dream of a watch with just about any setting or bit of info available if you delve deeply enough. The sync is a dream after years of clunky 'will it won't it ?'  fitbit experience. This watch just works and works well.I think it may not suit non techy users quite as well, at least initially. I very nearly put it back in the box to return - really glad i persisted though. The garmin way of doing things. settings, screens etc is a bit weird and non intuitive I think. the features are there - but not where you might expect. Having said that - wade in - it really is worth it.I love the always on feature and its way of presenting info generally is really clear and very user configurable.Just tried two walks - one planned and I turned on walk activity, one not.Ten minutes into the second walk my watch buzzed ' activity started message. Both walks were correctly logged with maps. The GPS tracking ties up with any other GPS device I have tried - apart from Fitbit that is. (Fitbit would log the track correctly but badly miscalculate the distances.).I find it comfortable. It logs sleep accurately as far as I can tell. turns off unwanted display during the night. (I'd wake up with my Fitbit Blaze filling the room with light - not so with this.)The only slight concern is that it crashed my Nexus Phone on the first  bike ride. All the data was there - but I needed to restart my phone. Hope this was a one off issue. I was hoping to have escaped flaky software issues having abandoned fitbit.",
            "I have used Fitbit for a number of years but found the device's not to be particularly robust, straps failed and connectivity issues I used and apple watch for a short period but didn't get on with it enthusiasm to do everything from a small screen. All this drove me to go in a different direction hence this purchase. it does everything and probably a lot more than I can understand but is doesn't do it as well as my previous Fitbit, the products don't look as good and have a laser specification , but when combined with the app it provides relevant and tangible data that is more simple to use and easier to desipher.Yes the Garmin product does everything you want, you may just want to determine exactly what you want and what the real value is for some of the feature offers.",
            "I had previously used a Fitbit but decided I would give garmin a try as their app seemed to have way more detail without the need to pay a monthly subscription like Fitbit does.It has a built in GPS and the app is better than Fitbit but the tracking is unreliable. It will only count one sleep a day and only if it is in between the time you set as your bed time on the app. Many times I have been awake for hours and it has said that I have been in a deep sleep. Also will not track naps outside of your set bed time. Fitbit was way better at tracking this.If you want to track your sleep this watch is completely useless. If you are looking just to track fitness or runs then this watch may be useful to you.It has given me a rash on my arm which I have never had from any watch. I\u2019m not allergic to anything so this is quite strange.All in all I would not recommend this watch, much better out there.",
            "I'm heavily invested in the Garmin eco system and have a Fenix 5 Plus as my main exercise tracker but was looking for something a little less in your face for everyday wear, the Venu caught my eye as it comes with Pulse OX, something that my Fenix lacks.Sleep tracking and oximetry seem on par with my Fenix and a finger mounted oximetry tracker whilst HR is within an acceptable range when compared to my chest mounted tracker, wrist HR will never give you 100% accuracy.Sadly as someone who is Clinically Extremely Vulnerable I have had little chance to test the outdoor and GPS capabilities of the watch however on a treadmill and exercise bike when worn at the same time as my Fenix i got comparable readings so have no reason to doubt it will be the same outdoors.I'll return to this to edit and give a full review once I'm able to spend time outdoors again.",
            "I bought this because my Fitbit broke yet again my friend says her fella swears by garmin well I\u2019m not impressed it was difficult to set up every day I have to turn my phone off to sync it then it went on the blink stops counting my steps I trouble shoot last resort says delete the app I comply 6 hours it took to reinstall because it said my watch didn\u2019t have Bluetooth badges are hard to come by on here because it only caters for fitness people who work out if you just want to count steps like me don\u2019t bother I walk 70 to 80 miles per week but the watch won\u2019t count the mile unless you press the walk button it\u2019s a bonkers idea if you walk it should be automatic in counting the miles so not happy I will be glad when it breaks down yawn",
            "I started with original Fitbit and my last was the Versa 2, I thought at the time it was great but truthfully it\u2019s more dumbed down, limited and scaled down in terms of details, the community stuff and supporting apps mediocre at best. I got this and firstly looks wise it\u2019s awesome I paid \u00a33 for a watch face and I\u2019m obsessed, the details, the accuracy similar to boditrax machine and it\u2019s more motivation with just more stats, details and little extras, I\u2019m unconvinced by the claims on battery life but charging is so quick I don\u2019t really care, the music features work but aren\u2019t that greatly laid out and the only other negative is the lack of screen protector options about to mix up the style, I can\u2019t say enough good things about it, it\u2019s a friendly kick up the bum.",
            "Love this. I\u2019ve wanted a Garmin watch for years but unfortunately was unable to stretch to the cost. When I saw this I decided to take the plunge as the price point was right. I\u2019m delighted with it. It looks great, is easy to use and has lots of useful functions. The colour is beautiful too. I went with the orchid colour which is a gorgeous metallic lilac shade.",
            "I should have known better. I have bought Garmin watches before (Forerunner 35s) but none of them lasted over a year before dying completely. But thes one didn't work at all. I charged it according to the instructions but it didn't set the time by GPS even when left out of doors for half an hour. It also refused to pair with the Garmin Connect installed on my Android smartphone, so it's completely useless.I would like to return it but this is no longer possible since Amazon insists on my taking it to a drop-off point, all of which are out of range for my mobility scooter. So the message is, if you do not have a car, do not buy anything from Amazon that you cannot afford to write off if things go pear shaped.",
            "Despu\u00e9s de mirar y mirar relojes deportivos tienes que saber lo que compras, es decir, buscas un reloj deportivo o un smartwatch? Si buscas un reloj deportivo para mi este es tu reloj, para mi ha cumplido con lo que yo buscaba, primero tiene cantidad de datos de salud que te hacen ver dia a dia tu estado de forma, la frecuencia cardiaca es muy precisa tanto en reposo como en carrera, mas luego todo lo extra que tiene como tu nivel de energia, respiraci\u00f3nes por minuto, hidratacion, el nivel de oxigeno en sangre son algunas de sus novedades respecto al vivoactive 3, tambien tiene los ejercicios con animaciones, yo los he probado y la verdad que es un plus mas para este reloj, de momento lo he probado solo en carrera y va genial, datos precisos y GPS muy bien, otro tema importante es la sincronizacion con cuentas como spotify o amazon prime para escuchar tus listas sin necesidad del movil para mi esto es muy importante ya que muchos relojes deportivos del mercado no cuentan con ello, a no ser que te vayas a garmin claro... Es verdad, que me consto configurarlo y que a veces se desconecta del telefono, al principio hay que tener paciencia y tambi\u00e9n con la aplicaci\u00f3n ya que es muy completa pero no va como deberia de ir, tarda bastante cuando te descargas algun extra para el reloj como las esferas ( por cierto hay cantidad de esferas para personalizarlas), la bateria correcta, si eres una persona que tampoco le da excesiva importancia como yo no tendras problema ya que puedes tenerlo 2 dias a tope, haciendo deporte con gps y musica una vez al dia o mas depende el uso claro, luego cargarlo tarda menos de 1 hora asi que para mi eso no es problema, por ultimo a\u00f1adir en estos conceptos positivos su pantalla amoled que se ve genial la verdad, he visto otros relojes garmin y no tiene nada que ver, si eres una persona que le da importancia a una buena pantalla este ser\u00e1 tu reloj, se me olvid\u00f3 comentar que tambi\u00e9n tiene entranamientos personalizados y una especie de entrenador personal para ayudarte a cumplir tus objetivos.Tambien me gustaria recalcar un poco lo que no me gusta brevemente aunque he de decir que es mi primer reloj deportivo, pero bueno... Lo primero digo que tienes que saber lo que compras, por que? Si buscas seguimiento, deportividad, fiabilidad... Garmin es tu reloj, en este caso garmin venu, pero... Buscas tambi\u00e9n smartwatch? Este no sera tu reloj... Por eso leo comentarios de gente que se queja e imagino que es por que no se habr\u00e1 informado bien, para mi pantalla amoled esta muy desaprovechada, es decir, no hay un avance en el reloj respecto a sus antecesores para darle a esta pantalla mas utilidad, no tiene ni altavoz ni micr\u00f3fono, es decir no puedes contestar por voz notificaciones, e de decir que en mi huawei las notificaciones a veces no me llegan al reloj, no se por que, pero bueno al pr\u00edncipo le daba importancia luego hasta las he desconectado por consumo de bateria y por que teniendo el movil tampoco es de gran utilidad, se pueden contestar desde el reloj con mensajes predeterminados que eso si los puedes configurar a tu gusto,puedes ver el tiempo del dia en el momento pero no el del dia siguiente, en fin... Solo quiero decir que como smartwatch es flojito, tiene utilidades basicas, pero creo que esto no empa\u00f1a lo que es este reloj ya que garmin se caracteriza por deportividad y no por smartwatch, por eso este reloj cumple de sobra que con todas las funciones a parte es bonito y ligero ideal para llevarlo en tu dia a dia.",
            "The screen is huge, which means it is very clear to read but I am a woman with a very small wrist and a prominent wrist bone. I was finding it uncomfortable to wear because one corner was rubbing on my wrist bone. So I gave the watch to my 6' tall partner who loves it. Instead I have bought myself a Garmin Vivoactive 4s, which has a smaller, circular screen and is more comfortable.",
            "I had had several smartwatches from other manufacturers which I enjoyed using. However, I wanted a watch with a colour screen and one which looked more like a conventional watch. The Garmin Venu was the one I chose and I\u2019m not disappointed. It\u2019s a lovely looking watch and isn\u2019t too heavy to wear. I have to say I\u2019m also impressed with the sand-coloured silicon wristband as after two months continuous wear, it still looks as clean as the day it arrived.The watch is easy to use and navigate. I really love the fact it displays blood oxygen levels as well as showing stress levels. The app supplies you with loads of data each day. It has helped to motivate me to become more active and to aware of my water intake as well as keeping tabs on my sleep.Like others, I have experienced some irritation from the back of the watch if I wear it too tight for too long. I now only have it tight on my wrist when exercising to alleviate the issue. Swapping wrists and wearing it with enough space between your skin and the watch really helps. Garmin were keen to help out when I reported the issue and they encourage you not too wear the watch tight unless exercising. They also recommend cleaning the watch regularly. Having followed their guidance I no longer have any issues. I\u2019m now looking forward to receiving a new screen protector as I mistakenly ordered a matte finish which makes the beautiful OLED screen look dull. Hopefully I\u2019ll be able to place the new protector on without bubbles!",
            "I've had this unit for about 3 weeks now. I've had several Garmin Fenix start watches and fitness trackers ove the last decade. This was purchased to bridge the gap between now and when the next fenix is released. My usual garmin is a fenix 5 but this lacks respiration tracking and spo2 which are necessary for me at night.I've used this Venu SQ to record a few rides and walks over the last two weeks and have now \"lost\" two activities due to the touchscreen picking up a tap on the discard button on the screen when a damp sleeve hits it between stopping the activity and hitting save. There is no undo or recover deleted activity function.The battery life is also dyre, not as bad as my apple watch but 2-3days max usually closer to 2.",
            "I\u2019ve now had the Venu about 3 months, it\u2019s easy to read and use generally. Inaccurate on sleep. My question is, why is it not made clear that connection to Garmin Express is essential to keep the GPS accurate? Things were going well until it recorded one run as being 10 MILES away from where it actually took place. I\u2019ve had some other runs that had \u2018gps drift \u2018 of about 100metres or going up 3000m in one run!!!  It was only connecting to a garmin express (using cable to connect to PC) that these problems stopped. It should be made clear that it must be connected regularly to keep up to date. And why can\u2019t these updates be done via the garmin app as most smart watches manage to do? Or some notification that an update is available and must be installed?? From ready various forums online other people have had same problem.",
            "This watch is much better than I expected. I was concerned about the battery life, but I typically get about 10 days from a charge. I have 'always on' turned off, as well as GPS and auto detection of activities. If I turn on the GPS, for a walk, for example, then I find that it uses about 4% of the battery in an hour, which I think is pretty good. It's also light and comfortable to wear. My main criticism is that the alarm has only a weak vibration and no sound, but this probably won't bother most people.",
            "I\u2019ve owned many Garmin premium watches and I have to say that the Venu 2 is one of their most accurate, best all round watches. I just can\u2019t get enough of it. Battery life is good, but the screen is the biggest selling point. Brand new watch received, in a sealed box. Highly recommended!",
            "I used Fitbit Ionic for over two years. I had no problems it's working, it completely stopped working and had no choice but to buy a new one. I went for change and got this smart watch and let's say I regret buying it. I should have paid \u00a350 more and stick with Fitbit. The app for checking run progress is very limited, has no functionality other then recoding time and distance.The sleep tracker is rubbish, it records the time when I am in my mobile as sleep. I records  9 hours of sleep for me. I have never slept for more than 6 hr. Fitbit Ionic was very accurate with recording sleep.I would suggest buy a Fitbit rather than this crap.",

            "Purchased the Garmin Venu Sq having recently bought one for my wife's birthday and being impressed with the functionality on top if the basic step counter of my trusty G Shock. I haven't encountered any real issues in the 3 - 4 weeks I've owned it for. The watch was easy to set up and the accompanying app provides an array of data that is both useful and easy to navigate. Despite using the GPS function for exercise purposes once a day on average, I am only having to charge it every 5 days or so, which is far better than I was expecting. Considering the price in comparison to some other branded smart watches, I can't fault this product so far.",
            "I used to have a vivosport but I thought I would upgrade to something more state of the art. I also bought the screen protector which I would recommend. I'm surprised at the size but then comes bigger screen estate and why the protector is necessary.Had it for 4 days and used GPS once a day and its now to 24% so hoping 5 to 6 days for the battery. There are alot of settings which don't appear on the Mobile app but are on the watch for example GPS satellites so you might get a better lock depending on your selection and your location.I like the different faces and widgets and have no regrets in making this purchase.",
            "I do like this watch, it\u2019s got some lovely features, previously used a 235, now given to the hubby (which is more bulky), can\u2019t complain on the features but a few times I found the activity stopped recording during a run, don\u2019t know why, better since I deleted/stopped the auto pause function but has only done this once since, so some frustration on reliability during a run. Worth NOT considering if you\u2019ve got \u2018fat fingers\u2019 or less than perfect vision to use the touch screen (I run with contact lenses and can struggle to see the screen during a run)",
            "I have had 3 samsung watches and the battery life was terrible. The Samsung watch 3 didn't even last 24 hours with sleep tracking. So glad I changed to garmin and wish I had done so sooner. It does everything I need it to, and best of all they battery still had 17% left after 12 days. Absolutely amazing watch. I will never go back to samsung",
            "Really impressed so far, thought it would be too big for my wrists but it fits fine. The screen is lovely. I'm used to having fitbits which are a nightmare to connect to your phone, the Venu connects very quickly and automatically which is nice. Love how much information it shows you aswell. Battery life is good, only lost a couple of % over the course of the day and that's with using the GPS on a bike ride.",
            "Great product, bought for myself as previously had a fit bit but found it uncomfortable to wear. The garmin is very comfortable and battery life lasts approx 5 days. Maybe more. Very quick to charge, takes about an hour from empty. Lovely user interface.Does support Spotify playback once you have downloaded playlists to your watch and use of wireless earphones is very easy to set up!Very impressed and worth the money. I will never go back to fitbit!",
            "I've had this watch a few months now and put it through the test. I usually get about 7-8 days battery out of it, which consists of daily walk tracking, also daily workouts and hiking/mountain biking on the weekends. It constantly tracks heart rate and gives steps done too plus a lot of other things. The metrics given from Garmin Connect help you see how you are doing / compare anything, this is a great fitness watch.I would probably stick to the Garmin brand if I was to get a new watch, they definitely know what they are doing.",
            "I got this for the body battery, having had a Fitbit before and wanted more info on HRV and rhr. The sleep tracking is off and for some reason doesn\u2019t track my whole night (likely the fit, but I sleep with it nice and snug but not too tight) but it always gives me a lower sleep than I had, and often doesn\u2019t show me as awake when I recall looking at the clock, and doesn\u2019t list REM when I remember my dreams! It also has an alarming oxygen sat monitor, if it was to be believed I should be in hospital! Often telling me I\u2019m in the 80\u2019s at night and I don\u2019t have sleep or breathing issues! I wouldn\u2019t replace it with this model again.However It knew I had Covid before I did, charging me only 1 overnight, then the following day I tested positive!",
            "The watch is fantastic but the other services are a little complicated . The other features are interesting when somebody can work them . For anybody above 70 years of age of technology is daunting to some ! I bought the watch principally for golf and so far I have been unable to use it for this purpose . In time I am expecting to use it when I have had a little more tuition .",
            "Dies ist meine dritte Smartwatch und die erste f\u00fcr die ich eine Rezension schreibe, einfach weil ich begeistert von ihr bin.Ich war auf der Suche nach einer Smartwatch die vor allem sportliche Aktivit\u00e4ten tracken soll aber auch einige Smartwatch-Funktionen mit sich bringt.Die Garmin Venu war ein Volltreffer.Die vorinstallierten Sportprofile sind sehr umfangreich und f\u00fcr mich mehr als ausreichend.Die GPS-Ortung weicht etwas von der mit Google Earth gemessenen Route ab. Bei einem mit Google gemessenen Lauf von 6,41 km hat die Garmin 6,56 km angezeigt. Bei einer Radtour von 52,3 km waren es bei der Garmin 54,1 km. Im Detail betrachtet sieht man bei der Streckenerfassung leichte Abweichungen von der tats\u00e4chlichen Route (Weg), wodurch diese Ungenauigkeit zustande kommen. Das war aber \u00fcberwiegend in bewaldetem Terrain und ich muss sagen, die Garmin misst da um ein vielfaches genauer als beispielsweise ein \u00e4hnliches Produkt von Samsung. Zudem sind diese geringen Streckenunterschiede f\u00fcr mich wirklich vernachl\u00e4ssigbar.Toll finde ich auch die offline Musikfunktion \u00fcber Spotify (nutze ich) oder alternativ Deezer. Vor allem beim Laufen fand ich es nicht so toll das doch recht gro\u00dfe Handy mitzuschleppen um Musik zu h\u00f6ren. Bluetooth Kopfh\u00f6rer und die Venu reichen jetzt aus. Mit der Verbindung hatte ich bisher keinerlei Probleme obwohl die Arme ja immer in Bewegung sind.Die Puls Messung ist erstaunlich genau im Ruhezustand. Der Vergleich zu einem Brustgurt ergab bei den meisten Messungen nur eine Abweichung von 1-2 Herzschl\u00e4gen. In Bewegung und vorallem beim Mountainbiken, gab es gr\u00f6\u00dfere Abweichungen zum Brustgurt. Ich denke das liegt an der Messmethode und weil beim Mountainbiken in unwegsamem Gel\u00e4nde, der Arm st\u00e4rkeren \"Vibrationen\"/Bewegungen/St\u00f6\u00dfen ausgesetzt ist.  Bei Fahrten auf der Stra\u00dfe oder beim Laufen lagen beide Messungen sehr nah beieinander.Zus\u00e4tzlich misst die Uhr noch die Body Battery (praktisch wieviel Reserven der K\u00f6rper noch hat), den Stresslevel, Schritte, Kalorien, der Schlaf wird getrackt (scheint mir sehr genau zu sein aber Achtung: kurze Nickerchen au\u00dferhalb der normalen Schlafenszeiten scheint die Uhr nicht zu erkennen), die Atmung, sowie den SPO2-Gehalt. Vermutlich kann sie noch mehr, aber mir reicht schon diese Anzahl an Daten weswegen ich nicht nachgeschaut hab ob noch mehr m\u00f6glich ist :-)Der Akku h\u00e4lt ebenfalls sehr lange, zumindest f\u00fcr mein Empfinden und im Vergleich zu den beiden anderen Smartwatches die ich hatte. Bei 3-4 sportlichen Aktivit\u00e4ten pro Woche mit GPS Ortung, Musik beim Laufen, Pulsmessung, SPO2 Messung w\u00e4hrend des Schlafens, Rumgespiele usw., lade ich die Uhr im Schnitt alle 3 Tage.Optisch macht sie meiner Meinung nach auch was her. Sie ist recht schlicht gehalten, die Qualit\u00e4t der Materialien und der Verarbeitung ist hervorragend und sie tr\u00e4gt sich wirklich sehr angenehm. Ich nehme sie nicht wirklich wahr. Einzig der Geruch des Armbandes direkt nach dem Auspacken war etwas unangenehm. Dieser ist aber nach wenigen Stunden verflogen.Garmin Pay zum kontaktlosen Bezahlen gibt es auch. Konnte ich bisher nur einmal testen, hat aber reibungslos geklappt.Benachrichtigungen (Mails, Nachrichten etc.) funktionieren ebenfalls. Hierf\u00fcr muss aber das Handy in der N\u00e4he sein und da ich sie nicht verwende sind sie ausgeschalten und ich kann nicht viel dazu sagen.Kleines Minus aber keinen Sternabzug wert wie ich finde, ist das Laden der Venu. Das Ladekabel ist zum einen sehr kurz und zum anderen h\u00e4tte ich mir eine magnetische Ladestation (wie bei vielen anderen Anbietern) anstelle einer Steckerl\u00f6sung gew\u00fcnscht.\u00dcber die Langlebigkeit kann ich derzeit noch nichts sagen. Daf\u00fcr habe ich die Venu noch nicht lange genug.\u00dcber die restlichen bisher gemachten Erfahrungen mit der Smartwatch, habe ich berichtet (vermutlich f\u00fcr manche zu ausf\u00fchrlich :-)) und hoffe ich konnte dem/der einen/ein oder anderen damit helfen.",
            "This product is great when it comes to its features, however the battery life is terrible.It lasted around 10 days to begin with, and then when charged fully only lasted 1 day despite the claim of 5 days.Product was returned and a full refund was processed.",

Could have sent it back and got another one sent but that would be a complete waste of time in my opinion when this watch is now set up for me.",
            "Love my new watch. I don't think I'm using it to its full potential yet but it was very easy to set up and start using. Love the colour and the fact a full charge lasts almost a week. My favourite thing is looking at the map on the app after a walk,  it's amazingly accurate!",
            "Bought this for a present and might get myself one. Works well with apple phone and seems to have excellent battery life. Lots of health functions not sure about apps. Its water proof to 5atm. Its doesnt say on the packing but I checked. Good buy",
            "This smartwatch does everything I want and 'need'. Got fed up with other brands when wearing overnight, as they switched on and woke me up. This one asks when you go to bed and get up and doesn't light up during that time, but it still responds to being switched on if needed. The apps are easy and the only drawback is that all units are American, so imperial - just as we have got used to metric!",

Its not too big - I have small wrists & it doesn't look overly large when I wear it.  The colour & rose gold face edge make it look good so I will wear it when I go out with the girls too!  I love it :-)",
            "Was looking for a watch to record walks including GPS that would link to Strava. Does all that but noticed it had golf app, it is much more detailed for golf than my dedicated Garmin golf watch so this came as a bonus. It does everything I want accurately. Love this watch and very happy I chose this watch against cheaper alternatives. Spend a bit more and you get a lot more.",
            "I bought my partner a cheaper garmin smart watch for around \u00a399 and paid \u00a3179 for this one. It\u2019s total garbage. My partners syncs far faster and is more accurate. The mobile is ok with a cheap garmin but not this one.  This takes forever to sync to my iPhone and I keep getting a memory full message on my smart watch and have to connect it up to my laptop to delete it. I persevered for a while but unfortunately went past the return date. If I could give it NO STARS I would.",
            "I absolutely love this smart watch. Is so great and smart looking packed with lots of sport futures. Great for any active person or bit less as well",
            "Great device. Partner has a new Apple watch. This is way more simple but for heart and exercise tracking totally awesome. Plus at least 5 days of charge. GPS spot on. No frills but what is there is perfect",
            "It's everything I want in a watch, but there have been 3 occurrences of this losing bluetooth connection with my phone (Oneplus 7 pro). To fix it, I had to remove the device from the app, and remove the Venu from the Bluetooth devices in the system app. Sometimes that didn't work so I also had to delete the Bluetooth connection cache on the phone.Apart from these quite annoying occurrences, it gives me great stats and tracking info. Though the sleep tracking isn't too accurate as it only relies on movement and heart rate - if I'm on my phone in bed late at night and not moving much, the watch records that as me being asleep. Though this is a minor grievance.All in all, a great watch, though very rarely unreliable.",
            "the information you get for this watch is brilliant, very simple to follow it.i have only had this watch a couple of days but find it great when walking or running, there is so much good info, regarding accurate pulse, distance speed, and overall steps with each activity's also found a lot of tutorials on you tube, love this watch",
            "The most basic requirements of a running watch should be fast fix and accurate track. However this watch has one fatal flaw - it can take up to 15 minutes to get a GPS fix if you are surrounded by tall buildings. There is a work around by using the Garmin Connect app but this adds another unnecessary factor.  Some days I just want to throw on running shoes and go without having to wait ages for a fix. This watch does not deserve a rating of 1 star because overall this watch is certainly packed with useful features, a good display and great battery life.  However I am giving a rating of 1 star because lack of a fast fix trumps everything else.",
            "Have been thinking of getting a Smartwatch for some time and when I saw that this was Highly Recommended by Which I decided to purchase. I have not been disappointed. It does all that I want a Smartwatch for but the User Manual has to be uploaded to view (unless you are happy to print off a fairly lengthy booklet!). I'm sure it's of more benefit to fitness/health fanatics than it is for me because I am unlikely to use all it's functions. One item I cannot get my head round though is that it appears to show weather details but nowhere can I find how this is acquired or what all the detail represents!",
            "Looked to find an alternative to a Fitbit upgrade but for some functions you had to subscribe to their premier which i did not want too and decided on the Venu SQ as it looked smart and was an attractive price.I have had it for two weeks and i am very happy with it",
            "Garmin was recommended by a friend. Great purchase. Love the mini yoga move demo. Use for multi sport. Battery lasts over a week if I only use it as a step counter. Looks less sport than normal",
            "Extremely angry.... Received order today and product package was open and there was no Watch or leads inside!",
            "I have an iPhone 8 but this garmin didn\u2019t pair at all with my phone, due to \u2018Bluetooth not being on\u2019 although my Bluetooth was definitely on, and the garmin didn\u2019t connect to GPS or my Windows PC.  I followed the troubleshooting guide but that didn\u2019t help so I got in touch with Garmin customer service.  Customer Service said the only way to fix the problem was by one of their technicians accessing my desktop remotely.  I wasn\u2019t keen on that and asked if there was another way, but was told \u2018there\u2019s no other way to fix it.  We cannot help you\u2019 so I agreed to letting a technician help out.  I received a phone call a few minutes later from a technician who just read out the troubleshooting guide verbatim.  I said I\u2019d already gone through those steps, and the reply was that he\u2019d contact a watch specialist to contact me shortly.  4 hours later, still no phone call so I\u2019ve returned the Garmin and ordered a Fitbit.  Amazon customer services arranged a return and refund with no problem at all.",
            "The watch is really well. I like it and it has lots of activities, that you can change the name should you want. I exercise a lot with the rebounder so I usually choose cardio and make amendments for the name, which is great. The only downside is that the battery lasts 2 days. In the beginning, I had the notifications on but I thought to close them in order for the battery to last longer, but I have not seen any difference in that. I loved the fact you can plan challenges and you also have the running coach, even though I have not used it yet, I think it is great.",
            "This is a great competitor for the Apple iThing (which has a 1 day or less battery).  With battery life that extends up to a week, it does everything you really need from a clever watch. From Sports tracking and fitness, blood oxygen, watch faces, Apps and a whole load of stuff you'll never need or use! Do you really need to spend \u00a3450+ on an Apple Watch? Well you have more money than sense ;). You can even buy different straps for it that don't cost 50 quid.",
            "Rapid delivery. Great fit. Easy to set up and go. Came with 35% battery life. Easy to charge but battery lasts days. Navy and Gold casing look stunning. Not worked out how to connect to my spotify account and music yet. Fitness tracking is easy and seamless.",
            "Stylish, simple to use smart watch - everything I was looking for at a great price, I really love it!!",
            "Good watch, stays more in line with regular watches and has a great battery life . Taking a decision on a watch was tough and I think given the current market this is the best I can get for a fitness,gps and music enabled. I have Apple music and prime music so that did play into the decision .Good: works with my ecosystem , battery , tracking features , nice screen displayCons . Iffy touchscreen controls, connectivity to app has issues, syncing to Nike run club, not really intuitive , poor store outside of the one animated screen that looks good , sports like badminton and general training does not really fit.",
            "I ditched the Fitbit Versa due to poor heart rate monitoring when sweaty but this is just as bad.  The app and the watch has tons of features but it's just way too much and frankly hard to believe that it's all accurate, especially if the heart rate monitor doesn't work well.  Also found the sleep results to be worse than the FitBit Versa.",
            "It's a lovely watch with some great features. However, I am on my feet at work all night and do around 8,000-10,000 steps during my shift and the battery doesn't last more than 2 days, despite following trouble shooting guides on the garmin website. Don't get me wrong, I love the fit, the features and that it has garmin pay, however, having to charge it every 48 hours is inconvenient. I'm a little disappointed following owning a vivosport which sleep tracking and battery life are far superior  but it doe have less features.",
            "The only problem I have is the vibration for a workout. I've got it set on high, but can hardly feel it...Garmin say it's me at fault, I say it's Garmin . I'm not the only one with this problem. Apart from that it's good",
            "I bought this watch to replace an older Garmin device mainly because a) it looked good and b) I wanted to use the built in GPS to track outdoor walks and cycle rides. It did indeed look good and the battery life was great for a GPS watch. However, the GPS tracking was inconsistent. Sometimes it would record my activities but on too many occasions it would start to record my activity but I would find that it hadn't actually done so. Very frustrating to get to the end of a cycle ride and find that it hadn't tracked it  despite GPS signal having been located ok & the tracking correctly started at the start of the exercise. This inconsistency led me to return the watch.",
            "Received the item yesterday. I am a Garmin supporter and have been using their kit for more than five years now. This watch was purchased for my daughter who wanted the watch to be able to play music without having to carry an ipod with her during runs.The watch is sturdy, just like all other Garmin devices but the execution is a notch over norm. Flawless.It has been just a day so cannot say much about battery life - feature wise is pretty much like a Forerunner 945 (maybe some high end features are not there), again did not play with it too much. Will write another review in six months after we get to see how it works.",
            "I really didn\u2019t like the build quality on this watch & the touch screen isn\u2019t very responsive. I preferred my old 920XT.  As a replacement I went for an Apple Watch 6 instead and returned the Venu. The Apple Watch is intuitive & Garmin have a long way to go in that regard.",
            "Good heart rate trackingMore of a sports watchLess of a smartwatchIf you are looking for a sports watch with a decent battery life, look elsewhere because this product is woeful from that perspective. Use it on the lowest settings possible and be lucky to get 2 full days. The battery drainage is also incredibly erratic.",
            "Acquistato il giorno di uscita ma ero molto titubante perch\u00e9 il precedente Venu e anche il Vivoactive 4 non mi rilevavano il battito in quanto ho il braccio tatuato, quindi ero nuovamente retrocessa ai dispositivi con sensori precedenti. Questo Venu invece mi ha stupita in positivo, e' molto bello esteticamente, preciso su tutte le misurazioni e rileva tutti i parametri correttamente, bisogna sempre comunque controllare di indossarlo nel modo corretto.Ho aspettato un paio di settimane per testarlo bene, e sono molto soddisfatta, facendo anche 2 attivit\u00e0 al giorno mi arriva a 4 giorni completi di autonomia. Molto preciso nel nuoto, con conteggio vasche, distanza, battito cardiaco, calorie e molti altri valori, si possono impostare ripetute e tempi di recupero, sul fitness e pesistica ottimo, lo uso anche x camminare ed il GPS \u00e8 velocissimo e il percorso salvato preciso!Schermo molto bello, si pu\u00f2 impostare sempre acceso, ma per le mie esigenze preferisco usare sensore di movimento. Parte smart molto valida, si pu\u00f2 rispondere con messaggi preimpostati dal display, lo trovo molto comodo quando sono al lavoro e nn posso usare telefono, anche perche' si possono aggiungere parecchie risposte da poter utilizzare poi al bisogno! Si possono scaricare app e aggiungere widget!Che dire... molto bello, molto valido, preciso su tutto, molto soddisfatta di questo Venu. Prezzo super accessibile! Amazon sempre top, arrivato in 1!",
            "Very good product I\u2019m really happy.Of course is not so advance with app and gadgets but is simple and good quality.",
            "I loved the Venu and it worked well for running and cycling. Until after having it nearly a year the screen decided it would stay on all the time (it used to go blank until lifted to view) This ate the battery within hours!To be fair the Amazon, they refunded. I\u2019ve now bought a Garmin Instinct Solar. It\u2019s great.",
            "Acquistato da un paio di settimane, pur non essendo esperto in quanto \u00e8 il mio primo smartwatch, devo dire che questo prodotto \u00e8 davvero ottimo. Dispone di moltissime funzioni. I sensori sono precisi nello stile Garmin della quale ho gi\u00e0 acquistato diversi prodotti. Gli algoritmi di rilevamento un po' meno dato che, per esempio, una serie di movimenti importanti del polso, per esempio usando un martello, viene registrata come effettuazione di passi o ancora lo stare fermi a letto, se ricade all'interno della fascia impostata come periodo normale di sonno, \u00e8 registrata come sonno leggero anche se si \u00e8 completamente svegli (ma le fasi del sonno vero e proprio mi sembrano riportate correttamente cos\u00ec come l'ossimetria (rilevazione dell'ossigeno nel sangue). D'altro canto sono attivit\u00e0 molto difficili da registrare con sensori al polso. La app Garmin Connect integra egregiamente  il Venu offrendo, per gli appassionati, moltissimi dati, grafici e statistiche nonch\u00e9 personalizzazione dei quadranti orologio e numerose app installabili (tramite la app Connect IQ). Il Venu \u00e8 stato immesso sul mercato da poco per cui alcune imperfezioni software sono accettabili e saranno presto risolte. Inoltre offre a un prezzo accettabile funzioni che fino a qualche mese fa si trovavano solo sul top di gamma (molto pi\u00f9 costoso) Fenix 5, mi pare. Per chi volesse risparmiare una cinquantina di euro, \u00e8 bene sapere che il Venu \u00e8 il fratello gemello del Garmin Vivoactive 4 dal quale si differenzia solamente per il tipo di schermo (amoled invece di led e con maggiore risoluzione), un unico diametro (43mm a fronte di 40 e 45mm del Vivoactive), del peso (46 gr a fronte di 50,5 gr) e della durata della batteria (inferiore sul Venu).",
            "Never had a bad product with Garmin. I bought it to replace a Fitbit. My wife loves it",
            "Desideravo un Garmin da tanto tempo e finalmente me ne sono regalato uno.Inizialmente ho avuto difficolt\u00e0 con i settaggi, infatti i dati che lo smartwatch registrava non venivano poi trasmessi all'applicazione, problema risolto resettando le impostazioni senza portare allo stato di fabbrica, ci\u00f2 mi ha permesso di conservare le attivit\u00e0 gi\u00e0 svolte.Il rilevamento del battito cardiaco \u00e8 pressoch\u00e9 perfetto.La misurazione dello stress \u00e8 ugualmente affidabile, ho verificato che durante eventi particolarmente stressanti, tipo dentista, i livelli registrati hanno avuto un picco.La misurazione del sonno \u00e8 buona, anche se non mi sembra perfetta.La funzione body battery sembra ben fatta, ma avendolo da poco si deve ancora tarare al meglio sui miei ritmi.Gli allenamenti con la funzione hiit sono molto comodi, si imposta facilmente l'intervallo di tempo di lavoro e quello di pausa, una vibrazione ci avverte quando dobbiamo faticare o riposarci, trovo molto comodo non dover guardare l'orologio ogni secondo.La funzione GPS pur non essendo perfetta \u00e8 molto precisa.Nell'applicazione Garmin connect sono disponibili varie sfide, gli avversari sono sempre pi\u00f9 o meno del nostro livello. Ad esempio sfida passi settimanali, km mensili, ore di allenamento...Il fatto di poter personalizzare il men\u00f9 \u00e8 molto comodo.La batteria dura 5-7 con tutti i sensori attivi, tranne quello della saturazione dell'ossigeno che tengo acceso solo durante la registrazione del sonno.Altra cosa bellissima \u00e8 che se ad esempio vado a camminare o a correre e mi dimentico di avviare l'attivit\u00e0, lui la riconosce e dopo 1 minuto per la corsa e 10 per la camminata ti avvisa che sta registrando l'attivit\u00e0. Registrazione che poi si nota essere partita quando abbiamo iniziato a correre o camminare.Che dire? Sono molto soddisfatto dell'acquisto.",
            "Brilliant bit of kit. I use it mostly for swimming. Counts my metres brilliantly. I count in my head and the watch is always spot on. Keeps steps and heart rate, stress levels, sleep etc. Brilliant",

            "This is my 2nd watch as the first one was determined to be faulty by garmin tech support. Replaced in December and this one now has developed the same issue. Will randomly tell me I've climbed 30 or 40 stairs when I've not even walked 100 steps. This happens if I've taken the watch off at night and put it back in the morning.The gesture wake up option is also very Intermittent.Overall it does what I need but this glitches make it annoying and poor quality.",

B joggen) werden sofort gestartet und GPS ist in wenigen Sekunden vorhanden.Von der Akkulaufzeit war ich positiv \u00fcberrascht, nach t\u00e4glichem Gebrauch und 2x Aktivit\u00e4t (mit Musik h\u00f6ren) , musste ich die Uhr erst nach 1 Woche laden.Die Uhr l\u00e4sst sich ganz einfach und ohne Probleme mit dem Handy und der Connect App verbinden.Touch spricht auch super an.Die Musik Funktion ist auch super, l\u00e4sst sich \u00fcber die App einfach Downloaden (z. B. \u00fcber Spotify) und man hatte seine Lieblingsplaylist auf der Uhr.Die Kopfh\u00f6rer verbinden sich auch sofort mit der Garmin Uhr.Einzig negative ist, bei den Aktivit\u00e4ten gibt es keine \"sp\u00e4ter fortsetzen\" Funtion, wie bei der Fenix, das ist sehr schade, gerade wenn man mal eine Radtour macht und erst in eins/ zwei Stunden sp\u00e4ter weiterfahren m\u00f6chte.Und leider gibt es keine vorkonfigurierte Wandern oder Inlineskates Aktivit\u00e4ten.Aber alles im allem kann man die Uhr nur weiterempfehlen.Sehr gutes Preis-Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis.",

I had this functionality on my suunto which was 4years old and (naively) just expected this to be standard. Its odd that garmin have not enabled this feature considering the watch has all the harware functionality to support this.",

The bazel seems to be very fragile.The downside was that after 10 days, suddenly, the watch died. The battery was at 70% but the display did not wake up anymore and the buttons did not work. A shame, I really liked the watch but I had to return it.I am very disappointed with Garmin. If you pay a very high price you expect that the watch is simply perfect.",

            "La correa es muy inc\u00f3moda, mucho, al menos en mi caso. Vengo de un huawei watch con correa de cuero y deportiva por detr\u00e1s que era un lujo y esta correa es insufrible, no resbala y si no te la quieres poner floja te acaba apretando mucho (tengo un brazo medio imagino, mido 1,83) Para un reloj tan caro me parece una pasada que le pongan una correa tan mala. Si quieres una similar a la de huawei watch, en la p\u00e1gina de garmin te cuesta 60 euros.. El sistema t\u00e1ctil de la pantalla tiene mucho que mejorar, es frustrante querer editar las repeticiones o tocar ciertas opciones y tener que estar d\u00e1ndole varias veces hasta que te coja el toque. Igual pasa con alg\u00fan desplazamiento sobre la pantalla. No es algo masivo pero es inc\u00f3modo.Luego he notado que si le pones car\u00e1tulas customizadas, cuando giras la mu\u00f1eca tarda mucho m\u00e1s hasta que se enciende, debe ser porque no es algo optimizado y tiene que recuperar ciertos datos, al final para que no pase, le pongo las caratulas por defecto. Tengo que explorarlo m\u00e1s a ver si hay algo en este sentido. El sue\u00f1o lo mide muy mal, al menos el inicio del sue\u00f1o, el resto no lo s\u00e9, me va midiendo desde una o dos horas antes de que me vaya a dormir y todos los d\u00edas le tengo que poner la hora m\u00e1s o menos real.Luego el sistema de crearte sesiones de entrenamiento tendr\u00eda que mejorar mucho. Hay una lista grande de ejercicios para crearte las sesiones de entrenamiento, pero no vienen im\u00e1genes, es s\u00f3lo lista de texto y no sabes que es cada ejercicio a la hora de configurarlo y vas a los b\u00e1sicos que ya sabes o tienes que ir buscando de que va cada uno.Las aplicaciones disponibles buenas en la tienda son muy muy pocas. Aqui podr\u00eda hacer Garmin un mayor esfuerzo y no s\u00f3lo poner aplicaciones malas que sube la gente sino ir construyendo aplicaciones \u00fatiles y optimizadas.La esfera es un poco peque\u00f1a para mi gusto, y este modelo en concreto (en azul) es un poco feo tambi\u00e9n desde mi punto de vista, probar\u00e9 cambi\u00e1ndole la correa a ver si encuentro una de cuero deportiva como mi precioso huawei watch gt (que es muy bonito pero no tiene tantas opciones como este ).Por lo dem\u00e1s, y es por lo que le pongo 3 estrellas a pesar de ser tan caro y tener todas estas carencias, creo que es un gran reloj deportivo, seguramente el mejor que he tenido hasta ahora, con muchas posibilidades.Me gusta la posibilidad de crearte tus propias sesiones de entrenamiento en las que poco a poco puedo ir incrementando la dificultad/series/rep/pesos/tiempo, el pulsometro es el mejor que he tenido, me gusta que tienes un calendario donde puedes ir planificando, te puedes poner objetivos, una carrera futura, desafios, etc..Tambi\u00e9n tiene el coach para carrera progresiva que empezar\u00e9 a utilizar. M\u00fasica con bluetooth. Lo de ver los ejercicios gr\u00e1ficamente cuando los vas a hacer, aunque tengo que explorarlo m\u00e1s, y algunas cosas m\u00e1s. El gps creo que tambi\u00e9n esta bien seg\u00fan he le\u00eddo.En resumen, es un gran reloj deportivo pero tiene unas carencias muy grandes. Ir\u00e9 editando seg\u00fan el tiempo para ver si lo van mejorando con actualizaciones o bien te dejan abandonado con lo que has comprado, es mi primer garmin y no lo s\u00e9. En Huawei por ejemplo las actualizaciones eran constantes incluso a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s.",

The only annoying thing is the move alert, it doesn't seem to very accurate and tells you to move even when you have just sat down after being active, but that's the only downside which is pretty easy to ignore but just doesn't make it effective at encouraging you to move.",
            "This watch is incredible for the money. It does indeed track your health all day and reports reasonably accurately on things such as heart rate, steps and stair climbing. The pulse oximeter is also a very useful function, especially because Covid will reduce the dissolved oxygen as one if it's symptoms. Add to that various notifications and dedicated activity functions it is a very capable device.",
            "Amazing watch. The reviews don't do it justice. If you want a mixture between smart watch and running watch then this watch is for you. Granted it's not the \"best\" running watch or \"best\" smartwatch but it's a good combination of both.",

Die animierten Anweisungen sind mehr ein Gag, maximal anf\u00e4nglich von Nutzen. Durchaus zu empfehlen f\u00fcr Leute die ihren Fitness- und Stress-Level, Schlaf und Herzfrequenz tracken wollen.

Nat\u00fcrlich war ich auch Benachrichtigungen gewohnt, auf die ich wenigstens kurze Antworten senden k\u00f6nnte und eine Musiksteuerung musste es sein! Das ganze bitte mit einer Akkulaufzeit, die nicht noch schlimmer als die der Apple Watch ist!Nach all diesen Kriterien blieb nicht mehr viel zur Auswahl! Da ich ein Huawei P30 pro nutze, war ich auch nicht so wirklich gl\u00fccklich \u00fcber L\u00f6sungen wie die Uhren von Samsung, die eben auch auf ein geschlossenes System setzen. Also kam ich auf meiner Recherche zu Garmin!Die venu wurde es dann wegen des AMOLED-Displays! Ansonsten denke ich, ist die Uhr weitestgehend identisch mit der vivoactive 4 oder 4s bis auf die Abmessungen!Nach nunmehr einem Monat kann ich die venu echt nur jedem empfehlen! Sport sowie Herzfrequenz und Schlaf zeichnet sie mehr als genau auf! Was die Schritte angeht, kann man sagen, dass die Apple Watch hier absolut ungenau ist!!! Ich laufe t\u00e4glich sehr viel und habe einen Unterschied von bis zu 10000 Schritten am Tag, die ich jetzt weniger angezeigt bekomme! Nat\u00fcrlich habe ich hier mehrfach selbst mit- und nachgez\u00e4hlt,  das Ergebnis der venu stimmt! \u00c4hnliches gilt auch f\u00fcr Sporteinheiten! Auch hier hat das Apfelmodell doch sehr grossz\u00fcgig Kalorien gutgeschrieben! F\u00fcr denjenigen, der sich an beidem orientiert oder vor allem auch orientieren muss, kann das eine totale Katastrophale sein!Die restlichen Funktionen tun das, was sie sollen...Nachrichten werden angezeigt, man kann sie beantworten \u00fcber kurze, vorgefertigte Vorgaben, sie zeigt Wetter, Kalender und steuert Musik. Wer es einrichtet, kann auch mit der Uhr bezahlen.Die App, die eine zwingende Voraussetzung f\u00fcr die Verbindung ist, ist sehr informativ und man erf\u00e4hrt viel \u00fcber seinen K\u00f6rper!Ich nutze sie bisher zum Krafttraining,  Radfahren, Laufen und Schwimmen und bin in allen Bereichen zufrieden.Der Akku h\u00e4lt mindestens vier Tage durch, bei normaler Nutzung, also mit Sport, permanentem Tracking etc...Was den Preis angeht, ist sie sicherlich nicht g\u00fcnstig, aber f\u00fcr mich die beste Uhr, die ich je hatte!Positiv ist auch vor allem noch, dass die Uhr unglaublich leicht ist.Negativ kann man anmerken, dass ich bedingt durch das Silikon des Armbandes an den ersten Tagen leichte Hautreizungen in dem Bereich hatte. Aber da habe ich leicht Abhilfe mit einem Textil-Sportloop gefunden, die eh vom Handlich her praktischer sind!",
            "Has all the features I need for tracking my walking, cycling and running. Easy to set up and use one I got the hang of it. Garmin co ect app works well and syncs with Strava easily.Fantastic value for \u00a3200.",
            "I was really unhappy to see this Garmin smartwatch used, unsealed,  even with dirt on the bracelet and on the back of the watch.Sent it back and applied for a refund.Very very disappointed since I bought it for a gift that could not be offered at the right time.",
            "The box was opened when arrived at door step. I had previous high value orders also which were opened and twice Handset was missing from Phone box.Nothing wrong with Garmin product. But beware of Amazon deliveries.",
            "Although it seemed quite good on face value I was absolutely disappointed in day to day use, constantly dropping heart rate monitor so eneded up speaking to Garmin regarding the issue only to be told it is because I have tattoos!!!! Had I a 735xt previous to this and never had issues before, long story short if you have tattoos where the heart rate monitor is don't bother buying it, even Garmin gtold me to send it back.",
            "coming from the land of fitbit, this watch changed my workflow. I love it to death.  extremely happy, although I did replace the band it came with as my clonky wrist and silicone do not get along.  Along with the replacement band, this is one of the best purchases I've made for myself",
            "Bought this a present for my partner. They are very impressed with it and it\u2019s many features,  step counter heart rate and sleep monitor and it\u2019s long battery life. It is also quick to charge up when needed.It\u2019s also stylish and looks good. Overall a great present.",
            "Very delicate watch for an activity tracker. Scratches so easily, gorilla glass is useless. Warranty does not cover for free. Replacement costs \u00a3150.",
            "After trying several other brands/watches /trackers, I'm pleased to have found this one. Does everything I want it too without any fuss. The app is great and tells me exactly what I need to know. Fits comfortably and so far the battery life has been very good. Impressive tracker!",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0Die Fitness-Smartwatch von Garmin kommt gut verpackt nach Hause und ich muss gleich sagen das ich die schlechten Bewertungen hier nicht verstehe.Ich bin \u00fcber die Funktionsvielfallt der Watch echt \u00fcberrascht und trage sie nun eine Wochen fast ununterbrochen. Zu Anfang hat mich das Armband noch ein wenig genervt, muss aber auch dazu sagen das ich nicht der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Uhrentr\u00e4ger bin, bzw. war.  Nach ca. einer Woche hatte ich mich dann schon gut dran gew\u00f6hnt und finde es super interessant das alle Daten in der App gespeichert werden und man sich alle Statistiken sehr \u00fcbersichtlich anschauen kann.Aber nun mal im einzelnen zu den Funktionen, \u00fcber die App Connect IQ, kann man die Watch sehr einfach erweitern, wie zum Beispiel mit einem Navi, neue DisplayDesigns, WetterApps und vieles mehr. In den einzelnen Apps steht dann auch immer f\u00fcr welche Watch die App kompatibel ist ( dazu einfach unten auf Kompatible Ger\u00e4te klicken und eine List wird angezeigt).In der App Connect hat man dann alle Daten \u00fcbersichtlich aufgetragen und da ich immer Bluetooth an habe wird auch immer gleich wenn ich die App \u00f6ffne alles aktualisiert. Es werden sogar Sportarten automatisch erkannt, ich war echt erstaunt als ich mal Radfahren war ohne es auszuw\u00e4hlen usw. und nach der Tour habe ich dann gesehen das es direkt als Radfahren erkannt wurde und aufgezeichnet wurde. Auf dem Hauptbildschirm kann man dann auch jede Funktion wie Herzfrequenz usw. nochmal anklicken und bekommt da noch mehr Informationen, zum ganzen Tag und auch zu den vorherigen Wochen als \u00dcbersicht, auf den Button Hilfe bekommt man beim StressLevel zum Beispiel auch beschrieben wie sich dieser zusammensetzt und auch Tipps wann und wie man gegen den Stress vorgehen kann. Alle Daten wie Gewicht, Alter usw. werden zu Beginn abgefragt und dann gespeichert. Beim Schlaf finde ich Interessant das auch angezeigt wird wieviel Tiefschlaf man hatte usw.. Ganz unten sieht man dann die Durchschnittswerte vom Tag und der letzten Woche.  \u00dcber den Einstellungsreiter oben links kann man dann Aktivit\u00e4ten, Trainings, Ausr\u00fcstung, Gruppen, Kontakte und vieles mehr einstellen.Unten hat man auch noch 5 Reiter wo man Challenges, Kalender, News und aktuelle Benachrichtigungen bekommt. Alles sehr \u00fcbersichtlich und gut gemacht.Um die Watch als SmartWatch nutzen zu k\u00f6nnen muss man in denn Einstellungen die Apps frei geben von denen man Benachrichtigungen erhalten m\u00f6chte.  Auch hier alles \u00fcbersichtlich gestaltet und Whatsapp klappt wunderbar, hier kann man auch kurze vorgefertigte Antworten direkt mit der Uhr verschicken. Meine Frau wei\u00df so immer wann ich im Auto sitze und keine Zeit habe und nur kurze Standard Antworten kommen.Auch Musik kann man \u00fcber die Uhr abspielen, zum Beispiel Amazon Musik freigeben und \u00fcber Smartphone starten, dann kann man Lieder vor und zur\u00fcck machen und auch die Lautst\u00e4rke anpassen.Die Herzfrequenz-Messung funktioniert aus meiner Sicht sehr gut, ich kenne es von meinen alten FitnessTrackern das sie immer sch\u00f6n eng anliegen sollten um gute Werte zu liefern, das mache ich hier auch und wie schon oben erw\u00e4hnt habe ich mich nach ca. einer Woche gut dran gew\u00f6hnt. Die Werte kann man sofort ablesen und sieht sie sich auch st\u00e4ndig \u00e4ndern wenn man nun in Bewegung ist. Au\u00dferdem hat man bei den Gesundheitsstatistiken noch Stress Body Batterie und Atemz\u00fcge pro Minute. Ich schaue mir das echt viel an und versuche auch so gekonnt den Stress sehr zu minimieren und merke auch gut wann ich nun im Stress bin oder nicht. Man lernt sich und seinen K\u00f6rper so besser kennen und kann ich auch ein wenig besser steuern.Der Schrittz\u00e4hler passt mit dem was mein S10 anzeigt schon gut \u00fcberein, das immer alle Schritte richtig gez\u00e4hlt werden davon kann man nicht ausgehen, da bestimmt Bewegungen auch immer dazu f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen das es als Schritt gewertet wird. Ich hatte zum Beispiel bei einer 8 Stunden Autofahrt mit nur 2 kurzen Pausen ohne viel gelaufen zu sein, knapp 1200 Schritte auf der Uhr. Bei einem alten FitnessTracker hatte ich mal nach einer Motorradausfahrt knapp 20000 Schritte und habe danach auch keine Tracker mehr beim fahren getragen.Ansonsten hat man noch die Funktionen sich die Wetterdaten anzeigen zu lassen entweder schon auf dem Startbildschirm oder wenn man ein paar Seiten weiter wischt, dort hat man dann Temperatur, Luftfeuchtigkeit und auch die Windst\u00e4rke sowie eine Wolke den den aktuellen Stand anzeigt, klickt man drauf kann man sich die St\u00fcndlichen Daten anschauen. Auch kann man die Kalendereintr\u00e4ge immer schnell abrufen, die Fl\u00fcssigkeitszufuhr eintragen, und auch sonst vieles mehr. Ich glaube ich habe noch lange nicht alle Funktionen entdeckt und probiert.Die Verarbeitung finde ich sehr sauber und qualitativ, was ich aber auch nicht anders erwartet h\u00e4tte. Die Armb\u00e4nder k\u00f6nnen einfach getauscht werden und so man sie seinen Bed\u00fcrfnissen und dem Outfit gut anpassen.Zum Display selbst kann ich sagen, das es in meiner jetzigen Einstellung immer an geht wenn ich das Handgelenk so kippe das man typisch auf die Uhr schauen m\u00f6chte oder wenn ich 2-mal drauf tippe.Das Problem hier weswegen ich auch einen Stern abziehe und nicht genau verstehe warum das so ist, ist wenn ich eine Jacke anhabe und die Uhr unter dem \u00c4rmel ist und ich nun drau\u00dfen wo es hell ist auf die Uhr schauen m\u00f6chte und das Handgelenk typisch bewege geht das Display oft nicht an.  Hab ich nur ein T-Shirt an oder die Uhr ist nicht unterm \u00c4rmel funktioniert es wunderbar. Ganz merkw\u00fcrdig.Kurz noch zur Akku-Laufzeit die hier neben der Musikfunktion schon von Einigen als nicht gut bewertet wurde, ich habe sie so wie jedes neue Ger\u00e4t mit einem Akku erst einmal einen Tag voll laden lassen und dann immer in der jetzigen Einstellung gehabt und hatte nach 7 Tagen noch 19% Akku, ist nun WhatsApp usw. eingeschaltet und es kommen viele Nachrichten rein und die Uhr vibriert bei jeder Nachricht h\u00e4lt das Akku trotzdem locker 5 bis 6 Tage. Und wie gesagt habe ich sie durchgehen an, lege sie maximal eine Stunde am Tag ab.Zum Laden kann man noch sagen das sie super schnell auf 80% geladen ist und nach knapp \u00fcber einer Stunde ist sie wieder voll.Da ich gerade viel sitze, erinnert mich dir Uhr auch immer ganz nett das ich mich mal wieder bewegen sollte im Studium und auch wenn das StessLevel lange hoch ist, sagt sie einem man sollte mal ein wenig drauf achten. Finde ich echt klasse gemacht.Wie gesagt bin ich sehr zufrieden und gebe hier gerne 4 Sterne eher muss man sagen 4,8 aber ich m\u00f6chte auch keine 5 Sterne geben da man sonst nicht darauf aufmerksam macht das es doch aus meiner Sicht eine Sache gibt die man verbessern kann.Ich hoffe ich konnte Ihnen ein wenig weiterhelfen und bedanke mich f\u00fcrs Lesen.",
            "I purchased the Garmin Venu Sq for my wife and she loves it. She particularly enjoys the ability to download music to the watch via Spotify. No more running with her mobile.It's a watched packed with features and covers a host of activities.And to top it all, it was a great price.",
            "Ich habe das Produkt gekauft, weil ich zum Laufen genauer tracken wollte, wie sich mein Gesundheitszustand entwickelt.Die Uhr kostet 349 Euro, daher dachte ich, dass sie alles hat was man braucht.Sie hat f\u00fcr 349 die wichtigsten Laufinfos nicht und damit bin ich sehr entt\u00e4uscht.Andere Uhren f\u00fcr 149 Euro bringen alle diese Funktionen mit. Es ist also eine reine Preispolitik.Was fehlt?Trainingseffekt, Erholzeit, training load siehe firstbeat website.Andere Uhren f\u00fcr 200 euro weniger haben diese Funktionen!Soll ich mir jetzt noch eine Laufuhr von Garmin holen?!?!?Ich denke ernsthaft nach den Anbieter zu wechseln",
            "Nice watch and extremely good value for money. Good range of features including OX level, various fitness programs, weather apps, Spotify \u2026etc. Love the square face too. Top marks to Garmin for delivering a great watch.",
            "I have used Garmin products for many years. Everything I had worked excellent. I bought the Garmin Venue watch and had problems continuously. Eventually returned and received another one. This was also faulty. That had been returned and I have switched my brand",
            "The battery life is very good one charge has lasted me a week and I've still got 30% mainly used for walking at the moment.I've got no complaints can't wait to use in the gym and swimming when allowed.It's very easy to use.",
            "Absolutely love this watch. It's light and comfortable to wear and provides so much data. Far more than I will ever need. It's great to go running without my phone and be able go listen to music whilst tracking the run. Exactly what I was after.",
            "This is the fourth Garmin watch I've owned in 15 years and it doesn't disappoint. Ready to go straight out the box, really easy to use and tracks everything I need it to. Slight disappointment that you can't use Garmin Pay with any UK credit or debit cards I own, but not a deal breaker.",
            "Great item does everything I need. Bargain",
            "I upgraded from a vivoactive 3 to the venu and I must say I'm happy I did, the battery life for me has been excellent, I go to the gym 4-5 days a week and only have to charge it twice during the week which I do whilst in the shower, accuracy is..... Well... Accurate, heart rate etc is spot on what the gym equipment states has no issue with counting reps and so on.GPS is bang on the money with accuracy tooGarmin pay works a treatScreen is really niceIt's comfy and don't notice it on most times",
            "A month or 2 in and its become easier to use, intimidating at first but used all the on line help to make it easy to use. Battery life better than expected, Connected to Strava which give additional info",
            "The watch has loads of options for exercise. The milage is off and you are unable to collaborate some of the completed exercises but its a nice fitting watch. I charge my watch every other day, sometime for a while in the hope it lasts longer - it doesnt.Alot of money for a mediocre watch.",
            "Great value for money. Sleep tracker is definitely not \"spot on accurate\" but works well enough. Good at tracking my steps and calories burnt. NEVER have a problem connecting the watch to the app on my phone which is BRILLIANT!",
            "Only down side is due to the square watch face and it being a new watch there isn\u2019t many apps for it yet. You can use cardio to track most things or bike then edit the activity in the app afterwards to anything you like like sailing, windsurfing etc.I do really like the look of the watch and size. It also is really light and feels nice to wear. It is very are wearing I have worn mine continually even when doing DIY and jobs round the house and no signs of wear yet.",
            "Love this watch, it's great for so many different activities! The battery lasts really well too.",
            "Sleep tracking rarely picks up me waking, battery life if a few days, original strap not flexible enough not got to grips with gym workout tracker yet..  But would still recommend",
            "This watch has everything you need step counter text and email alerts and when someone phones.My only complaint is that you do have to reconnect with your phone sometimes.",
            "Honestly do not buy this watch it is extremely overpriced for what you get and is both poor software and hardware and inferior to brands such as samsung and apple",
            "I really like the look of the watch on my wrist and it feels really light and at times forget its there. I really cannot comment too much on the performance of the watch as I have only had it a week, however with the time (pun) \ud83e\udd2d I'v had the watch, I think it performance perfectly!",
            "What the hell Amazon! The box seal is broken and the watch is not in the box! This came sold directly from Amazon. I just sent another watch back because the box was previously opend. There is something seriously worng with your Wearhouse security.EDIT: Amazon have replaced the watch. So hopefully I get an untampered with item this time",
            "El reloj est\u00e1 muy bien. Tiene gran cantidad de deportes predefinidos, incluyendo algunos con animaciones para poder seguir entrenamientos cargados desde la aplicaci\u00f3n m\u00f3vil, como pilates o yoga.El gps tiene muy buena precisi\u00f3n,  aunque tarda ligeramente m\u00e1s en obtener la posici\u00f3n que mi anterior Garmin, el Forerunner 235, pero m\u00e1ximo 1 minuto y tienes la ubicaci\u00f3n.La pantalla es fant\u00e1stica, se ve genial y responde muy bien en lo t\u00e1ctil.No tiene funciones para seguir tracks con las funciones que vienen precargadas, pero hay varias aplicaciones para cargar y seguir tracks. Igualmente hay alguna para seguir google maps de forma m\u00e1s que decente.En cuanto a las funciones de smartwatch, para m\u00ed m\u00e1s que suficientes. Recibe notificaciones de whatsapp, calendario, email etc y se puede contestar con respuestas predefinidas. En otras plataformas hay m\u00e1s opciones como smartwatch, pero en mi caso no las acababa usando y valoro m\u00e1s el aspecto deportivo que las funciones smartwatch.Pesa muy poco y no molesta en la mu\u00f1eca, aunque he de reconocer que el Fossil Sport que tengo aparcado es m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo, \u00e9ste es m\u00e1s o menos igual de c\u00f3modo.Como puntos negativos dir\u00eda que echo de menos m\u00e1s pantallas de reloj anal\u00f3gicas que exploten las caracter\u00edsticas de la pantalla oled, aunque supongo que con el tiempo todo llegar\u00e1.  Igualmente la interfaz podr\u00eda ser algo m\u00e1s atractiva, pero intuyo que Garmin hara updates interesantes en el futuro. Es una marca que cuida sus productos.Igualmente, me gustar\u00eda que la pantalla no tuviera bordes, aunque es algo habitual en muchos de estos relojes.En cuanto a la bater\u00eda, nada que ver con el smartwatch wear os que usaba hasta ahora. 3 d\u00edas facilmente se consiguen, con entrenamientos de piscina y running incluidos.",
            "I bought the Venu 2s as an upgrade from my vivoactive 3. I\u2019ve had the watch about 6 weeks and am very happy with my purchase. The watch is smaller and more comfortable to wear and the interface with my phone is much improved. Battery lasts much longer and GPS and HR monitor seem accurate.",
            "I bought this watch as I have started my fitness journey 3 months ago and this watch does not disappoint. All the features on the apps are fantastic, I get all the info I need and more! I love the body battery and sleep functions, as well. I was unsure if getting this or the new fitbit, but I'm glad I went for Garmin.",
            "Big garmin fan already but this watch has all the technical stuff but also looks pretty! Perfect for a sporty girl!",
            "Bought this to help me regain some fitness after having surgery.  It\u2019s worse than the wife as it keeps reminding me to move and get started then rewards me when I meet targets.EXACTLY what I need.Lovely clear screen with plenty of exercise options with instruction video to guide you through.Great bit of kit.",
            "Un ottimo compromesso tra sport e smart watch.Io lo uso prevalentemente per correre ma anche per uscite in bicicletta e camminate in montagna.L'ho comparato con il Garmin 235 con fascia cardio e con il Suunto Ambit 2, sempre con fascia cardio, e i dati restituiti sono praticamente gli stessi. Si completa con le app per smartphone Garmin Connect ConnectIQ.Contapassi, misura dello stress, conto dei piani saliti, battito cardiaco, pulse OX e tantissimi altri dati.Lo schermo \u00e8 strepitoso e con i quadranti nativi \u00e8 velocissimo. Un po' pi\u00f9 lento con quadranti di terze parti.Io sono estremamente soddisfatto",
            "Battery life is great, usually between 4-6 days depending on what features are activated. Garmin ecosystem is great, lots of apps but still can be better and i really hope more developers will make use of the great amoled display. Accuracy depends on whether you're tracking 24-7 or activities, in which case it can vary a little.All in all, a great watch to have.",
            "Bought for my other half and he loves it! Useful on his long cycle rides which was what I bought it for.",
            "not impressed with item. felt it was too complicated for a novice emailed for returns label after 40 mins from delivery",
            "Beautiful watch and seems to track well. I havent lost connection with my phone yet. Not the biggest selection of watch faces, there are download able ones but they don't seem to have the same quality as the originals.",
            "Excellent! Good battery life, great mobile app. Golf GPS works well.Great price!",
            "2 Monate getestet, voll zufrieden.Ich hab die Uhr gekauft um Mountainbike Touren und Wanderungen aufzuzeichnen. Ich wollte bewusst keine smartwatch. Sondern ein \u201c Sportger\u00e4t\u201d. Die Zusatzfunktionen wie Puls, Schrittz\u00e4hler etc. sind sehr gut. Man kann mehrere weitere Apps hinzuf\u00fcgen. Ich kann die Uhr mit Komoot verbinden und sie aktualisiert sich selbst.Der Akku ist aus meiner Sicht richtig gut. Also 5 Tage bei aktiver Nutzung gehen ohne Probleme. Ich hab die Uhr auch schon 10 Tage ohne gro\u00dfe Aktivit\u00e4t wie mountain biking genutzt. Einfach wie eine normale Uhr sonst auch, nur halt mit Schrittz\u00e4hler, Puls Messer und Fl\u00fcssigkeitsaufnahme. Kein Problem f\u00fcr den Akku.Die ihr ist optisch gut, ich trag sie gerne. Duschen ist kein Problem.Ein Detail st\u00f6rt mich manchmal. Der Touchscreen ist ab und an mal etwas tr\u00e4ge, also reagiert langsam. Das kann aber auch an der Schutzfolien liegen die ich separat gekauft und aufgebracht habe.Alles in allem... ich w\u00fcrde mir die Uhr wieder kaufen!Wer beim Sport getrackt Tweeden m\u00f6chte eins dabei Daten sammeln will, die Uhr auch als Alltags Uhr nutzen m\u00f6chte, kann hier aus meiner Sicht nichtsfalsch machen.Bin sehr zufrieden",
            "Sorry but I cannot see how Garmin can justify the cost of this product. It feels and looks like a toy. Sent it right back without even using it.",
            "Good sports watch great to have the gps in  the watch, battery life is about 3 days since gps is on all the time. Mobile app is good too.",
            "This a very good value smart watch but the recipient didn\u2019t want it.",
            "Really like this.Easy to set up and use. Slightly obsessed with my sleep patterns now though!Only niggle is the inability for send a route to it from Garmin Connect to follow (even without a map; arrows would do). Pretty basic so should be included",
            "Dal 2012 uso solo dispositivi Garmin che per me sono il top come assistenti per le attivit\u00e0 sportive.Prima di acquistare Venu, avevo Active 3.Venu \u00e8 sicuramente superiore.La ghiera \u00e8 sicuramente meno esposta ai graffi.Display eccezionale.Sensore pulsazioni aggiornato, molto preciso e costante nelle rilevazioni anche grazie alla sua forma sporgente che pertanto, lo tiene sempre a contatto con la pelle.Quindi si evita di stringere il cinturino a pressione come dovevo fare con Active 3.Funzione ossigenazione del sangue.Funzione Body Battery.Possibilit\u00e0 di caricare la musica, sempre tramite App Garmin Connect \u00e8 direttamente dalla libreria musica del mio IPhoneConnessione Bluetooth con IPhone velocissimaNon vi sto ad elencare altro.L\u2019ho scelto dopo un\u2019attenta selezione e confronto con Apple Watch 5.Ho dovuto rinunciare al modulo esim ma fa nienteCome estetica si prensenta con una certa eleganza e sportivit\u00e0.da indossare in qualsiasi occasione, fa la sua bella figura.Anche il cinturino \u00e8 pi\u00f9 morbido e comodo rispetto all\u2019 Active 3.Lo consiglio vivamente",

            "A great watch. Did a lot of research before taking the plunge. Was also looking at the 935 but it was a no brainer considering the price difference. Also really like the AMOLED display.One thing missing is Open water swimming but I guess this would bring it too close to the 935.",
            "Nice watch: long lasting good battery, sharp screen etc.  Replaced a heavily used vivoactive 3 that had to be charged during long walks etc - the battery just didn't cut it.  The screen and widget glances are much better too and altimeter/barometer more accurate eg climbing stairs.",

Cinturino, corona e display fatti veramente bene e con qualit\u00e0.Altro discorso per software e app. Non sempre si sincronizza in maniera rapida, soprattutto caricare app e quadranti non \u00e8 molto intuitivo. Poi avere 2 app di gestione non la vedo una cosa intelligenteRender\u00f2 il prodotto perch\u00e9 sotto gli standard Garmin. La batteria non dura cos\u00ec come descritto e per quello che fa il costo non \u00e8 giustificato.Una vera delusione, Garmin deve migliorare e colmare il gap.",
            "Acquistato circa 1 mese fa, ho voluto testarlo bene prima di esprimermi. Ho avuto parecchi garmin e devo dire che questo e' uno dei migliori considerando l' evoluzione dello schermo e la luminosit\u00e0 ed e'uno dei pochi touch! Facendo 1 o 2 attivit\u00e0 al giorno la batteria dura circa 4 o 5 giorni, quindi ottimo...buono! Non e' paragonabile al fenix, ma dipende anche dall' utilizzo richiesto! Io lo uso prevalentemente x attivit\u00e0 in palestra e nuoto e direi che soddisfa pienamente le mie necessita'! Lo consiglio x chi vuole grandi prestazioni, ma non ha necessit\u00e0 di uso agonistico! Spedizione super veloce!",

            "Loverly looking watch.The time is not displayed all the time.Battery life is not that good.",
            "Good watch does a fair bit. In reflection I wouldn't have spent 300 on this but it looks good. Navigates well. Tracking works pretty spot on. Notifications all good.",

            "I just \"upgraded\" to this watch after having a Pebble 2. I can't believe that this watch cost twice the price and functions half as well.The battery is atrociously bad. I charged it last night and it lost almost 50% while I was sleeping!The UI is a confusing mess. There are two separate Settings apps. There are three separate app launchers.The button functionality is a mess e.g. for media controls the top button is Back, the bottom button is Forward, the middle button is Close. Why is the middle button Close!? Why isn't it Play/Pause!?There's a heap of bloatware apps that you can't uninstall. There's also invisible apps that you can uninstall, but you can't run those apps.WTF is the Fossil app?? I think it might actually be a broken app because it literally does nothing. This on a brand new device!The strap is also garbage. It's a $400 watch with the cheapest-quality $2 strap. What a rip-off.",
            "The battery life is terrible. It doesn't last a day the first time I got it I returned it thinking it was faulty but it's wasn't that's just the way it is. There's battery extenders but why have a smart watch if you're turning off all the features. Note the battery extender even turns off looking at the time. There is also a customised option but again why have a smart watch if you can't use the features? Including reading the time.Plus there no other way to charge it other than what is supplied with it.It's badly designed. When you exercise at the gym the knob where you turn it off constantly turns the watch off when you lift your wrist. You hold a weight up it turns off. You put your hands on your waist it turns off. It's just bad design.It never works when you want it to in terms of calling, sending messages etc.  Half the time Google commands don't work, there's an unknown error etc.And after having GPS, there isn't even maps loaded into it. You can't navigate from your watch. When you're walking you don't really really want to be looking and guided by your phone you want your smart watch to help you navigate.I used to have a Sony smartwatch. This was so long ago and to me it's way better than this one. Lasted ages, could charge from a USB, maps worked... The world has gone backwards with smart watches.I would have returned this if I could... Unfortunately I got a small ding on it... That's right it's not very hardy either. Basically just brushed against something and it got a ding.",
            "The phone paired easily and went through most of the setup process without issues. I then left it on the charger while it was still updating a few apps. A few hours later when I went back to it, it was on the clock screen and I could no longer get back into the menus. Flashes on and off, tried resetting (hard and soft) multiple times, same issue.So disappointing. . Spent hours trying multiple online suggestions to get it to work but it's still broken and all on day 1. I wouldn't recommend this watch to anyone. Such a waste of my time and now I have to figure out how to get my money back for it.... Tried to call Fossil \"customer service\" but they're closed on a public holiday.",
            "It is a shame but this watch has had a problem just a few days after the window for return closed, we are now having to send it back for return and not even being offered the opportunity for refund even though it is less than 6 weeks old, we have lost faith in the reliability of this watch. On top of that having sent it for repair earlier this week we are now in receipt of a text which says the repair centre has closed due to the COVID situationMy son is so disappointed as he was using it to track his exercise routines while in lockdownI would like a refund given the newness of this watch",

A veces no recibes las notificaciones y si las recibes correctamente se van almacenando, pero llega un momento en el que se borran y ya no puedes responder ning\u00fan mensaje.3. Solo puedes responder a los mensajes, pero no puedes enviar ning\u00fan mensaje sin que previamente no te hayan enviado uno.4. Hay momentos en los que falla buscar el m\u00f3vil, y cuando lo busca y suena el tel\u00e9fono, permanece apagado, por lo que a veces tienes el m\u00f3vil delante y aunque suene no lo ves. Para que pare de sonar tienes que darle a \"parar\" en la pantalla, no sirve poner la mano para que cese la b\u00fasqueda.5. No puedes acceder a ciertas apps de mensajer\u00eda, solo las prefijadas por fitbit, por lo que es una restricci\u00f3n bastante importante para aquellos que usamos varias aplicaciones de mensajer\u00eda.6.

            "Fitibit sense dovrebbe fare un sacco di cose, promesse nella pubblicit\u00e0 e nelle caratteristiche riportate, ma....non le fa.E' uno sport watch, assolutamente non smart. Infatti, acquistandolo a prezzo pieno, si ottiene un orologio ricco di aspettative che nel pratico, non sono eseguibili. Prima fra tutte, l'ecg non ancora abilitato. Poi abbiamo google non ancora presente. La messaggistica \u00e8 pessima, dato che non appena si riceve una notifica, questa sparisce appena la leggiamo senza restare in archivio. Non c'\u00e8 ancora modo di immagazzinare musica per ascoltare solo con smartwatch, ma si deve utilizzare spotify oppure un altro programma a pagamento.Il gps con me non ha mai funzionato.C'\u00e8 un parco app che non \u00e8 ancora disponibile, e non capisco come abbiano potuto mettere il prodotto sul mercato se ancora non \u00e8 attivo in tutte le sue sfacettature.Una cosa che mi ha motlo infastidito sono i grafici della app, incompresibili. Ossigenazione e temperatura si calcolano solo di notte e non si riesce  aleggerne i valori reali, ma solo percentuali assolutamente ignote.I passi sono soprastimati, poich\u00e8 in mezza giornata raggiungi diecimila passi anche stando fermo e muovendo solo le braccia.Le attivit\u00e0 sportive bloccano qualsiasi utilizzo dell'orologio, perci\u00f2 non si pu\u00f2 nemmeno uscire dalla schermata per cambiar musica o fare altro.Ci sono troppe cose che ancora non vanno e per il prezzo, direi che non ne vale ancora la pena. Bocciatissimo.",
            "It took me 2 weeks to decide whether to buy the Sense or not. I read uncountable reviews and was very hesitant. Since I own a smartwatch but wanted a really good health tracker in addition I thought I just chance it and try the Sense 4 weeks ago,At first I had problems setting it up. It just wouldn't connect to my phone. I tried for hrs and googled. After midnight I found out that I cannot have 2 watches paired with my phone. So there was nothing wrong wit the Fitbit Sense, I just had to unpair the other watch, I then reset the Sense (long press and hold of the button/indent for more than 10 secs) and voila, it worked a treat. In the meantime I had already started return of the item and printed all documents ;-)After 4 weeks I have now cancelled the return because I am 100% happy with my purchase.If you are a serious runner, you wouldn't go for a Fitbit anyway,right? You might go for Garmin or Polar. The Sense is ideal for those you want to track steps, sleep, HR, ECG and so much more. The SpO2 will only be measured during the night so you can see the value next morning. This is important for me because I have slight sleep apnoea and I like to know if it goes below 90%.Yes, in order to see the SpO2 you need to choose a certain watch face, I don't see a problem with that. If you need SpO2 monitoring all day you can buy an SpO2 metre to clip on the index finger.When you use this special watch face you can tap on the screen and it switches from SpO2 to  HR, another tap to steps, next tap to active mins, another tap to floors ( the only one I switched off. I don't use it )I have no problems with the indent /button at the side. It is just a matter of getting used to it. I have NEVER experienced that by bending my hand I accidentally would have hit the button. That never happened.The HR is very accurate, I compared it with the HR my Samsung watch showed at the same time(not connected to phone)The sensors have been very reliable .Some complain about lagging. I have no problems with that. It is a new watch with new sensors , there will be updates soon and I am positive that this point will be addressed. I do believe it depends on the phone the Sense is connected to and the firmware version of the watch. I had an update 2 days after set up and my watch works perfectly fine.Battery life is amazing. with 3 x 30min jogs with GPS every week and many notifications from several apps and even accepting phone calls my Sense last about 4 1/2 days. The charging speed is outstanding, it'll blow you away. 10 mins from 4% to 25% keeps me going all day if I forget to charge in time. I don't have to charge over night and miss out on sleep tracking. I charge when I'm watching telli. The charger is a strong magnetic one that attaches easily to the watch and doesn't fall off.The wristband is like most others : the silicone-sweaty-sort-of-thing. This is one thing I don't like but I found an elastic fabric one on Amazon.com and I just love it. I am hyper sensitive to all rubber/silicone so the elastic one is brilliant for me.What I also don't like is that to some of the features in the app you have only access to with Fitbit subsciption. This is included in the purchase for 6 months. I will not renew it and will be happy to read the stats, after 6 months I'm sure I know what they tell me.So as you can see , I am happy with the Sense and am confident that with future updates it will be even more exiting. We should be a bit patient, everything new can have hickups. I only encountered one: after changing the watch face, suddenly there were no data on my watch screen, it showed the symbol for steps but no figure, yet in the app all steps were shown. A simple reset of the watch (press button for more than 10 secs, hold and wait for Fitbit sign to appear) solved the problem.At last: I live in Ireland and my Sense already has the ECG feature which works a treat. Some countries will get this feature with a next update, as I understand.",
            "E' il quarto fitbit che acquisto , ma il sense e' veramente una delusione.Non c'e'l'ecg promesso, la misurazione della temperatura corporea non esiste , c'e' una misurazione della variazione della temperatura cutanea notturna che non serve a nulla se non si conosce la temperatura puntuale, la saturazione non funziona, il gps si aggancia dopo tre minuti quindi i report degli allenamenti sono sballati, la batteria non dura pi\u00f9 di tre giorni e non sei giorni come promesso, infine ci sono difficolta' ad accendere alla schermata home, occorre scuoterlo pi\u00f9' volte. Il cinturino e'pessimo : ho lo stigmate sul braccio. Non vale 329 euro. Se non fanno gli aggiornamenti entro il16 ottobre lo restituisco ad Amazon. Sconsigliato!",
            "Ok so i have been a active user of Fitbit for many many years and this is myost favourite device yet! The battery life is very good and I think I maybe getting 3 to 4 days (can't be 100%) as one of the apps on the watch was in use without me knowing due to a short cut I created!\ud83d\ude02 Changed now. The mobile app has NOT changed but has new additional information because of the additional info the Sense can collect. The accuracy seems the same as my versa except I seem to be sleeping better! Overall it's clean with a beautiful screen and doesn't appear any heavier on my wrist than my versa. The onboard gps is a great addition but don't add the walking exercise to the shortcuts as it will pick you up running round the house! A few tiny glitches but these will get sorted over time. There is no onboard music storage who h is a complete disappointment as I used to load up my versa and use it in the gym leavingyibile iny locker. But again, my most favourite Fitbit device yet.",
            "So I got this delivered on lauch day (25th September) and have worn it every day and night since.I have had many fitbit trackers in the past and the last one was the Ionic. I gave up on the Ionic after a year because I had so many issues with it, the worst being it would loose connection with my phone for no reason and then I had to unpair, delete and re install time and time again.I have been using the Samsung galaxy watch active 2 since and it was an excellent smartwatch but its fitness tracking was not good mostly because of the calories burned during exercise which was so off.I was excited to see the Sense on the fitbit website before it launched and I decided to treat myself. I always buy from Amazon because their customer service and aftercare is excellent.Putting it simply I love this watch. It looks great, feels premium and the screen is bright and clear. I'm fully used to the haptic button and prefer it to an actual button as it means that the watch will be better protected from water.My only problem is that when doing strenuous exercise like spinning the heart rate sensor takes a while to register the high heart rate reached, sometimes my heart rate slows a bit before the watch catches up which meand I miss out on the top range readings of my heart rate. Also the watch seems to think my heart rate drops down into the 110 to 120 bpm after an intense interval but my heart rate is definitely still really high in between hard efforts so this does bother me.  My Ionic did this when I first got it but it seemed to improve over time so I'm hoping that the Sense does too. My guess is that it is something software related which can be fixed. Also when weight training the watch puts my heart rate at 110 to 120 bpm when I know that after doing squats for 6 solid minutes with a weights bar my heart rate is way higher, my Samsung puts my heart rate at 140 to 150 bpm for this. Walking seems accurate as does martial arts and kick boxing. Maybe fitbit could fix this with an update.All of the features of this watch are great and I love it. I'm looking forward to seeing what updates come in the future to improve things. I'm especially looking forward to being able to answer phone calls on the watch as this was a big feature I enjoyed with my Samsung. The new os is nice and the connection to the phone is way more stable but it did drop out once so far and I had to unpair, delete and re install then it worked. I think that fitbit might be working on stability now as it needs to be better to be able to take calls on the watch so I'm guessing that's why we don't have that function yet.All in all I'm happy despite the niggles. I find this watch exciting.Update!My sense had to be sent back to fitbit today as it was faulty.  I'm very happy with fitbit customer service so far as they are replacing my sense with very little effort to action this.Unfortunately though Amazon now don't replace faulty products after the 1st 30 days. They used to replace faulty products up to a year after purchase which is why I bought it from them. I will just buy from the manufacturer in the future now. I have to say the Amazon customer service lady was excellent,  not her fault that the procedure has changed. Just thought this might be an important point to make incase anyone else buys from Amazon because of the returns policy which has now changed.",
            "This is my review of the Fitbit sense after wearing for 2 monthsPros: -battery lasts a long time and is quicker to charge than other models, the actual charger is much better as it works as a magnet to the device rather than the clip style Fitbit are most known to have- updated HR sensors, the ones on my old fitbits were very temperamental especially during sweaty workouts they would just cut off entirely at points, this watch does not have this issue, versa 3 also has the updated sensors.-looks very sleek compared with other models, other than it being a fitness tracker aesthetically speaking it is a nice watch.-fitness bands are much, much easier to switch between compared to other Fitbit models that use a pin type mechanism- screen display is clear, easy to read, options for always on mode so you don't have to manually turn on the display to view the time or your steps etc. The display feels a lot less clunky when swiping through your stats in comparison to previous watch models.-mobile app is useful and one of the reasons I'm loyal to the brand as it's very user friendly.-6months free premium in app subscription with purchase-google assistant and Amazon Alexa compatible-ability to take calls and read notifications and texts as they appear on your phone-sleep tracking much like on other models is useful and helps me aim to get more sleep each night, the daily sleep score is also a good indicator for improvementCons: - the price and the features you get Vs the versa 3 probably isn't worth an extra \u00a3100 in my opinion.-ECG feature seems quite gimmicky and I have only used it a couple times-stress sensoring features are not accurate in my opinion, I've had panic attacks wearing this watch and it has never alerted me of a raised hr as it's supposed to and my stress score has been good regardless of this so I would say this is either very buggy or just novelty.- just like all other official Fitbit straps I've experienced, I got a really bad rash. I highly recommend the adepoy third party brand of straps if you have this issue, steer clear of cavn (which was the most widely advertised straps when I initially went searching for a replacement) as they are made terribly and will snap inside your watch which is more than slightly alarmingOverall I am happy with my purchase but there is room for improvement and I definitely feel like the versa 3 would be just as good if you're not into the ECG features.",
            "Received in early evening. By bedtime I had reactivated my old fitbit account and paired the Sense with my phone. Wore both my old tracker and Sense overnight to compare sleep tracking. By the morning I could not sync my phone and Sense, pairing had gone. Tried to set it up again, didn't work. Followed the on line help, no joy. After 2 long calls to fitbit support during which bluetooth was off and on, the sense was off and on, a factory reset for the sense, fitbit app uninstalled and reinstalled no success. Also installed fitbit app on a tablet and the same happened. Pairing disappeared and could not get it to work again. During this time I was asked to use the Sense button several times, it worked about 1 in 5 times. This should not happen with a \u00a3250 smartwatch so it was returned. Thanks to Amazon for their prompt service.",
            "Looks and comfort great. Usability not so good! Once connected to phone, it diverts the notifications etc to watch,WHICH HAS NO NOTIFICATION SOUNDS. It was supposed to handle phone calls and have ECG capability,  but neither work. Its gestures and touch response were very poor and intermittent. I SENT IT BACK!!",
            "I bought this as my first Fitbit was an Inspire 2, but the strap caused severe irritation and wasn't as fancy, it wasn't something I could proudly wear while on my weightloss journey. The strap in the Sense is the latest and most premium strap I've ever used, it uses a different mechanism of attaching to the wrist and is much softer.Regarding the watch, for the first day I found it not to be tracking my heart rate that much, I'm not sure if it was simply postional error on my wrist or that the watch needed to get used to being on my arm as I have tattoos. It now tracks my heartrate all the time, although some nights I've found it has said it didn't get a consistent read and therefore never gave the more accurate sleep reading which tells you amount of REM sleep amongst other factors.I find the watch is more accurate in measuring my steps, perhaps due to GPS, and additionally it tracks floor climbed which the Inspire 2 does not. It's much easier to track and start exerc than the Inspire and the Versa is probably similar, so if you don't need EDA or heart rhythm than it may be a better purchase. I decided to get the most premium watch Fitbit produced as I prefer the Fitbit app in terms of tracking moreso than the Samsung watch I've used before. It is very useful and the premium is worth it in my opinion.Battery life for me is 4 days with dim screen brightness and not being always on, and with using the sleep mode at night which stops the screen turning on as you move in bed. Overrall I highly recommend the watch, but if you don't need some features I'd say the Versa is good enough.Edit: Small movements like moving up a flight of stairs or slightly moving in bed cause the watch to not read my heart rate until I remove it and put it back on, therefore leading to inconsistent sleep data and a lot of hassle. For \u00a3300 this is incredibly inconvenient, therefore like a lot of reviewers I returned this watch. If it worked I would've kept it, and if it does work for you, keep it.",
            "At first I was really pleased with my fit bit. It looks smart and it takes lots of measurements. However within a few weeks the flexible watch band came loose and the watch dropped off my wrist and landed on the floor face down.  The screen has smashed and cracked across. For a sports product I would have thought they would have made it more durable than this. Be warned there is no way of getting the screen repaired once it breaks unlike a phone or Apple watch. So you will have \u00a3300 of useless plastic. I am actually still paying for mine too. Also to say I got eczema from the band in my wrist which must contain latex or similar and really flared up my allergies. As a final point many of the good features such as ECG you have to pay a subscription for after a few months. Won't bother with a Fitbit again!",
            "Having had and used a Fitbit since the start, my last Fitbit Versa needed an upgrade....I reviewed many other smart watches from all makes, but, finally to stick with Fitbit and purchased the Fitbit Sense.....Big mistake...PROSLovely strap and fixes into place far more easier than any other Fitbit I had previouslyBigger screen and much clearer to readI liked the push to get it going...despite some reviews, I had no problems operating itGreat Apps and I loved the 6month free premium albeit draining of battery if had all onSO..... apart from that I have nothing else to recommend THE Fitbit SenseCONSBattery life shockingly very short...longer if you took off all the apps that monitor your exercise health and fitnessConstantly not synching, apps not workingAND FOR me the worst thing about it was, it was not registering the correct steps/miles ECT from my runs on Treadmill and/exercisesI did sought advice from Fitbit help/community forum, to no avail, I felt I was fobbed off regarding the accuracy of mile sand/steps ran was down to GPS....sorry, but I did not have any of these problems with my Versa, which i have had for 3yrs....It was after several times uninstalling and reinstalling the Sense and still not working as advertised that I reluctantly had to send back.At \u00a3245, I expected the Sense to be working as advertised and yes I know they did do an operating upgrade to sort out glitches, it was obviously not enough.I for one am very very disappointed in the Fitbit Sense because if it was working as well as advertised, I could have enjoyed using it as my upgrade fitness smart watch.I have now gone back to my trusty old Versa where, at least, my miles and steps are in synch along with everything else",
            "Bit of history I've had fitbits for years now.. they've survived through, house renovations.. Crossfit and well even me getting run over!  Got the sense back in May, had it only 2 months and accidentally dropped it.... not from great height on to my kitchen floor the screen smashed.  Which amazed me because all my old ones (the last being the Versa 2) have been so robust.... I thought no worries I'm clumsy I'll get a screen... much to my despair they don't do replacement screens!!!!  a \u00a3300 watch and you can't repair it! I'm devastated.  It worked for about a week after but now wont even charge.The actual watch was good and I want another but I'm really worried it won't last me. Some of the apps aren't great but it's improving all the time.  I'll agree with a lot of the reviews about the strap... I have sensitive skin and had to replace it within a week.So I'm currently debating if to buy another and get a screen protector... (ironically I had one in the draw but thought it made the watch look ugly/bulky.. and all my others didn't need it so went without) or continue with my Versa 2.  I'm missing the GPS and the in-depth sleep functions etc. but just can't bring myself to shell out another \u00a3300 ... well \u00a3279 as they are at the moment.I even contacted Fitbit and I have to say they weren't overly hopeful at all and didn't really get that I was upset I couldn't get spares not the fact I couldn't claim on the warranty.. I knew that from the start I dropped it!",
            "This Sense would have been my 5th Fitbit watch however changing to the longer strap I noticed one of the easy release tabs was extremely stiff and I broke a nail on it. Eventually I was able to release the short strap and replace it with the longer one. Within FOUR days the easy release catch would not hold the strap and it fell off onto the couch. No fiddling would get it to hold the strap fitting.I am extremely disappointed with Amazon's customer service as they tried to fob me off to Fitbit rather than meet their legal requirements under Consumer legislation. They refused me a replacement and best I could achieve was a full refund.As a secondary example of amazon's terrible service to customers is the two additional straps I've ordered for the Sense are no longer required as amazon refused to replace the Fitbit, their solution is to demand over 50% of the purschase price of the straps to return them, the second one I have even received yet.Defintiely avoid this Fitbit Sense and purchase from amazon.I doubt they will publish this review because it is so damning of both Fitbit and Amazon!",
            "Had a few of these, first one would not connect (Ebay)., second had a faulty pixel (Amazon), so as headline, third time lucky.Bought for wife so she is really impressed, especially with Amazon doing the replacements / refunds. Me not so happy. Top class company, but an iffy product. Has it been released too early? Time will tell.happy to recommend, but maybe we have just been unlucky. ..... Time will tell.",
            "Charged and set up but thought it looked odd. It took me a while to work out what was wrong with it. The display is crooked. Writing higher on the left than the right. Once you see it you can't unsee it. This is going back. Hugely disappointed because I wanted to love this fitbit. Googled and found others with the same issue. I expected better for the money.",
            "I ummed and arred for a long time before buying this watch. In the end I decided that I didn't want a smart watch, I wanted a decent fitness watch that would give me all the stats I need to track my general health and fitness. And that's exactly what I got.The fitbit app is easily the best app I've used, it links with myfitnesspal to give me a real time calories in vs calories out (CICO) and the free trial of premium means I also have easily digestable articles and recipes to support my weight loss.I love that there are so many faces to choose from and you can design your own in a separate app. The EDA stress tracker with guided meditation is also excellent if you can take 2 minutes a day for some mindful breathing and meditation.Is it worth the extra \u00a3100 over the Versa 3? I'm still not sure. After a month I think I've used the ecg maybe 3 times and the skin temperature is useful only because I have a neurological condition that's affected by my body temperature and I'm hoping it will give me an early warning before flare ups. If I didn't have that I'd probably have gone for the Versa 3.",
            "Love it. This is my second Fitbit and it has so many more features than the charge 2. Bought for the health monitoring as much as fitness and its great. Very comfortable and the big colour screen is easy to read. Still getting used to navigating my way around it but overall it's great.  The only downside is the battery life is pretty low If using always on display and some other features but otherwise it's really good.",
            "Good looking fitness watch with lots of functions but it's let down by poor software and non existent product support.I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present and initially she had problems getting some of the functions to work and no stress management scores. Fitbit support were useless so we spoke to Amazon who sent a replacement and that is performing even worse, not reading SpO2 levels, sleep tracking or stress management scores.",
            "I find that the heart rate monitor is not accurate at all. More so when working out. I have cleaned the back of the device, restarted it numeroustimes and double checked it with other heart rate monitors. When exercising it can be as much as 50 beats per minute out.After a month of usage I Still find that this watch is a step or ten back from the Ionic. I am forever cleaning, restarting and manoeuvring the watch up and down my wrist. It is never accurate. I sit on my sofa and it reads 107 bpm heart rate. I go on a 9 m bike ride and it reads as 83 bpm.",
            "I regret buying this. Display is very sensitive and is not good for sports or exercise activity. Display cracked in 3 weeks after purchasing the product. The only exercises that I do is zumba and running.My husband and a couple of other friends are facing the same problem. I had versa and then decided to move to sense which I think was a big mistake!Currently it's at the amazon repair center and it's been a few weeks now. Hence I must say its not easy to get the display repaired as well !",
            "Compared with the other models of Fitbit, it is a bit expensive, but comparable with the more expensive smart watches available on the market.Battery life is excellent.  Only needs charging once a week.Bluetooth link sometimes drops on the Fitbit app if the Fitbit is out of range of the phone or tablet, and is easy enough to rectify.",
            "This watch looks and fits great. Best fitting smart watch / band ever.That's where it ends as nothing seems to synch and I can't get messages.The learning curve is way too high so it's being returned. Shame as I really wanted this to be great.",
            "Until I bought Fitbit sense I did not know how much I had REM sleep or deep sleep or movements during sleep. As you can see the photo from my iPhone it gives very good analysis of the sleep. It also provide good analysis of exercise.The battery consumption is also very good with fast charging.The only issue that I discovered to be carful is , that when I used it 24 hours for a long time , it is not good for the skin on the wrist . So when I am working I am taking it off and leave it on charge .",
            "All was going well until the strap in-clipped it-self, the phone fell on the floor and cracked the screen. Unlike Apple, Fitbit don\u2019t offer a screen repair service.",
            "1.) does not sync with IPhone health App2.) heart rate measure does not provide correct readings for sufferers of atrial fibrillation.3.) Fitbit app is ok but nothing special.4.) watch font size very small and not adjustable, not suitable for people with limited vision.5.) reports include men trial cycle for an 85 year old.6.) No option to disable steps for a wheelchair user."

            "This is my 3rd watch I've purchased from Mobvoi, and by far the best one I've owned.My previous watch (TicWatch E2) had a battery life that would last for a day, but I wouldn't want to push it past, and I never used the sleep tracking feature as I let it charge overnight.The difference in battery life between the E2 and the Pro 3 is chalk and cheese.I've been comfortably using the Pro 3 for multiple days at a time, with sleep tracking, heart rate monitoring, and all that jazz enabled 24/7, and I'm finding myself only needing to charge it for an hour or so every 48 hours. With a bit of settings, changing, it would very happily last 3 days.The new processor is far snappier and less laggy than in previous watches, and is a welcome change. The display is bright and vibrant, and the low power LCD-display on top is super cool, and reduces battery consumption *massively* in the 'Essential' mode.Notifications come through almost immediately from my phone to my watch, and I haven't had any connectivity dropouts at all, another welcome change from my E2.I have relatively small hands and wrists, and yet the Pro 3, with its massive battery, feels even slimmer than the E2, and it doesn't get in the way or appear unbalanced at all. Its screen has a relatively small bezel, and the metal trim feels nice to the touch.My only gripes are that it no longer comes with a cradle-style charger, and instead is more of a magnetic plug, and that the very lower area of the touchscreen seems slightly less sensitive than anywhere else.While this watch is priced in line with the 'premium' smartwatch market, it feels worth every cent.I wholeheartedly recommend this watch for anyone looking for a WearOS smartwatch!",
            "I have been using Ticwatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS since last week. This watch is a brilliant overall package which justifies the price tag. I wouldn't call it an affordable watch but it's worth every penny you spend for it.Feature rich watch with a nice 1.4inch oled display which is very good under direct sunlight. Unlike the Ticwatch E3, which I also own, this is equipped with an ambient light sensor which does the job very well. The secondary FSTN display is used as always on display. It comes with back light which helps in dark environments and there is an option to change the back light colour.Watch feels nice in hand not very bulky and very comfortable to wear. The silicone strap provided is very good quality. There is no visible gap between the watch body and the strap, which makes it look a lot better.Snapdragon 4100 is a beast. Coupled with 1 Gb ram the UI is buttery smooth. No lags or stutters as of now, everything works perfectly. Can't wait to test the Wear OS 3.0 which will be released sometime 2022.Fitness and sleep tracking works as advertised, thanks to the pre installed Tic health apps. You can access all the data from the Mobvoi mobile app or via Google fit. I found the data from the dedicated mobvoi app to be a bit more easy to understand. Heart rate and SpO2 monitoring works very well. I haven't tried any sports tracking yet, so can't comment on that.Speaker is loud enough and the microphone quality is good. Voice calls turned out to be good with no issues hearing me on the other side.The advertised battery life of 72 hours in smart mode is no joke. During the first week of my usage I was consistently getting 2-3 days of battery life with all the features turned on except GPS. Continuous Oxygen level and heat rate monitoring with sleep tracking didn't take a toll on the battery life.I'm really impressed with the performance of the watch, never experienced this kinda performance form a wear os watch. With the promised future wear os 3.0 update and great battery life, I would definelty recommend Ticwatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS.",
            "This watch is fantastic. It is an small improvement on the previous Pro3 GPS in a few subtle ways but it makes for quite an enhanced user experience. Overall I love Mobvoi watches as they work well in my ecosystem and this one is the cream of the crop with WearOS and a very snappy processor which makes all the WearOS integration whip along nicely. Highlights for me are the new strap which works very well and I won't need to sort another after-market once to replace this as it is good. The buttons are more tactile and \"clicky\" than the PRO3 GPS. The screen is quite scratch resistant as I scraped the screen while caving on some rocks and it didn't even leave a mark! PS. I will be putting a screen protector on it now! The health apps all work really well and this watch has dropped into my Mobvoi app without fuss.I need to talk more about the battery life which is improved over the previous version Pro3 GPS. Be careful with the always listening for \"okay google\" feature as I notice this can drain the battery a fair bit quicker.Overall I am completely happy with this watch. For the money this is the best Wear OS you can get and I am going to enjoy using this watch as probably my best go to watch at the moment.",
            "Design and Build :- it has got stylish design with an impressive looking black frame. The all black colour of the watch is just makes the watch look amazing. It has a light weight and comfortable strap which makes it wearable for as long as possible. It has got a good strong build but I would still recommend getting a watch screen protector to protect the screen from external hazards.Display:- it has got a crystal clear display with an amazing touch response. The resolution of watch is high that makes every function/ operation in the watch look clean and high quality.Features and OS :- Every aspect of wear OS and Mobvoi OS combined into one watch is surprisingly awesome. All the functions and operations in this watch work without any lags or interruptions. It has got a wide list of features for a smartwatch at this price point, the one that surprised me was it can monitor mental health along with physical health. It can do it by measuring your stress, mental fatigue, sleep and other aspects recorded by your physical health ( though I tried to build up stress to test this watch but I couldn\u2019t \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude02). The connectivity with my phone is seamless with no interruptions or lags and other connectivity features work good. Additionally, all the cool watch faces offered by Mobvoi are a boon.In terms of fitness tracking and physical health monitoring, it can monitor every sport or athletic activity I guess \ud83d\ude01( it has insane number of sport tracking modes, the list was huge ), it tracks your workout accurately and also give all your physical health statistics accurate to assist you in your workout or sporting activity. It even tracks swimming with all your Heath statistics ( that too accurately).BATTERY AND CHARGING:- The charging speed is amazingly fast but the problem is that the battery drains at a rapid speed during any workout tracking and activity that uses wifi/ internet.CONCLUSION:- here\u2019s a watch that looks good , has all the features an advanced smartwatch can have, at a not so heavy price tag I definitely recommend it. Small flaws do exist but they will become invisible one you explore this watch and it\u2019s features properly \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf.",
            "I have a number of Mobvoi products partially due to the price/value view point and also due to their fantastic customer service. This is a review of the watch so I won't go into the customer service side of things so much but will focus on the features of the watch itself.One of the 1st things I noticed about the watch was how solid and well built it feels. It has a good weight to it, certainly not heavy but it feels solid. This will be down to the fact that this version is now Military 810G grade making it incredibly hard wearing. I own other smart watches and I am constantly worried that they may get damaged when bumped but this watch gives you a sense of confidence. I work in a busy industrial workshop and at the time of writing, have had no issues with scratches, damage or dust .Next you notice how the strap feels. It is a thick, textured silicone strap which has a better feel than all of the 3rd party straps that I have bought. This may sound funny and will be completely personal to my wrists, but the holes are perfectly spaced so that the watch is in the Goldey locks zone - not too tight and not too loose!Connecting to Android Wear was very simple and straight forward. I'm sure it is the same experience as any watch but the snappy processor made the process quick and simple.The battery life is incredible which is partially due to the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100 Platform and Mobvoi Dual Processor System and also the dual screen. The LCD screen has all of the information on that you need at a glance; date, time, steps and current battery level and is highly visible in all lighting situations. There is even a back light (which I think may be LED) which illuminates the screen at the tilt of your wrist. This version of the watch allows you to change the colour of the light which is a nice touch.I have tried a number of training apps including Adidas and Nike but I always default back to the Mobvoi TicExercise app as the layout is very concise and easy to read. It also uploads all of the data to the app where you can view the data from the heart rate monitor (VO2Max, heart rate & zone etc), your pace, map of route taken etc. I would compare the app and the data collected to be on par if not better than the Jabra Elite app. I'm very impressed with this.There are many different exercise modes to select from. So far I have only tried 3 and am not sure what the differences are between what data the app catches but I will check them out over the next few weeks.The GPS locks on almost instantly and is consistently accurate which is useful as I run the same route daily and this allows me to track my progress. I have had no issues with drop out. I'm keen to test out the new barometer feature but have yet to locate this feature. I'll ask customer services who never fail to impress me.I have taken the watch swimming once at this point without any issues. The watch still functions in the water.The TicWatch has built in NFC which allows you to pay for purchases using your watch and Google Pay. This is a very handy feature which works most of the time. I have had to take my phone out on a couple of occasions to make a purchase as it didn\u2019t work with the watch. I get the feeling that this is more due to me not holding the watch at the terminal long enough, or the right angle and then I get flustered and then just get the phone out to pay.I would like to see smart watches which allows music to be uploaded to the watch without the need to bring your phone. I had very old Samsung watch which had this feature which makes me wonder why newer watches don't allow it especially as there is 8Gb of storage available. You can download and listen to playlists on the Spotify watch app which is a very handy feature. This means you don't have to bring your phone but I have a number of audio books etc which are not available on Spotify so I can't listen to these. Being able to upload them to my phone would be a handy feature.Any issues I have with the watch are more related to the Google Wear OS rather than the watch itself. What is very comforting to know is from what I understand, Mobvoi is only one of two brands which offer Android smart watches which are powerful enough to receive the newest version of Android Wear which is coming in 2022. These changes in the OS will apparently make further improvements to the already impressive performance and battery life.If you're like me and you do your research before making a purchase, you will be able to find many positive reviews on YouTube and websites. If you have any concerns about the fact that Mobvoi is maybe not as big a brand name compared to say Samsung or Garmin, be rest assured that the hardware, software and customer support are second to none. Then factor in the more competitive costing, I would personally not look past the TicWatch!",
            "Researched a few watches (Samsung, Fossil) before deciding on this. The biggest appeal was battery life and this delivered. Having battery last 3 days is what I would call reasonable(still room for improvement) for a smartwatch in 2021. Reading reports that other brands have at most 18hrs isn't something would bother with and so reason is why went with this.This doesn't have the latest version of WearOS, however don't know the difference (previously used Xiaomi Amazefit Bip) and find it performs snappy and reliable, but it is scheduled to get it in 2022 once Samsung/Google dodgey alliance ends.I took 1 star off however, as a situation happened when my phone died and had to revert to an old phone and during the last few days had accumalted good data (HR, sleep, steps etc). I wanted to sync this when installed the WearOS and Mobvobi apps however I couldn't simply disconnect and sync. I had to factory reset the watch for it to 'forget' the old phone which is simply stupid. Luckily had only used it a few weeks so my customization wasn't too different from newly stock, but for long-term users this isn't really ideal and don't know why it is needed considering it's tied to a Mobvobi account.But other than that, watch performs well.",
            "I bought this watch as an upgrade over my Ticwatch E2 that I have used for the last couple of years. This watch is so fast and smooth in comparison to to my old watch, that new chip makes a huge difference. The general feel and quality of it is excellent, well put together with a definite premium feel that the E2 was lackingBattery life has been amazing! I charged the watch when I got it on Thursday afternoon and still had 25% charge left on Monday evening. Never got that sort of life out of my old watch.... Obviously, that LCD screen overlay has a lot to do with that but it also makes the watch so much better in our bright Aussie sun, easily readable when a regular screen would be overpowered by the bright light.I am not a real sporty person, so I can't rate all the fitness features that come with the watch, but I can say that the heart rate monitor seems fast and accurate and the step counter is Handy to have available all the time.Overall, this is certainly a smartwatch that I can comfortably recommend to anyone looking to make a purchase, and great value for money as well!",
            "As usual I found the packaging and unboxing to be great, nicely laid out and easy to set up.  The watch overall feels lighter yet bigger than the TicWatch pro 3 I had on previously.  The screen is really crisp and the operating system and Tic apps + play store apps seem to operate just that little smoother so assume that is the processing chip.  Battery power is improved, and I get 2-3 days easy before needing a charge and that with everything enabled.My only issue is the charger, due to the way it sits under the watch (see pictures) it doesn't rest flat and that plays with my OCD tendancies.  Its functional though and does not easily disconnect.  Overall I am happy with the purchase, and would buy again",
            "Slimmer and lighter than expected.Very nice and large AMOLED screen.Very quick and responsive, faster than any other watch I've had so far, came from the original galaxy watch.Has endless apps and watch faces to explore.Finally I have Google pay!Needs a few more quick options in the drop down menu and needs an app manager/switcher.",
            "Got the Ticwatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS a week ago and I am loving it so far! Personally a big fan of the huge screen and long battery life. I find myself using the ticExcercise app most frequently, which helps me track calories burned, workout time and heart rates with lots of different excercise modes to choose from. The power saving time display screen is also one unique feature that I find really convenient. Overall a good purchase, very satisfied with it!",
            "The media could not be loaded.",
            "I\u2019ve had this watch for over a week now and I couldn\u2019t be happier.Great features and sleek looks at a price that is more than half the cost of other watches with similar features."

            "This was a present for my wife. She wanted a watch where the time was instantly visible (rather than having to lift to view) and mainly wanted to see when text messages and calls came in. While plenty of smart watches have an 'always on' feature, she really likes the fact that this actually looks like a regular watch first and foremost.With time, as we get back into exercise more, I'd say she'll use the exercise features more often too.I got an ANCOOL white silicone strap as well, which goes nicely with the silver watch body, and which was actually better quality than the supplied Garmin strap (which cost heaps more if replacing).",
            "I actually wish I had never spent the money on this product. It is literally a $800 step counter and watch. It never stays connected to my iPhone, even if the phone is right next to me it constantly connects and disconnects. I don\u2019t receive text message, messenger messages nothing.I\u2019m so disappointed. I saved for this watch, so to not get what it was advertised as is so disheartening. It is not what I expected an expensive smart watch to be like.The only positive thing I like about the watch is the look of it.",
            "Looks really good and excellent for notifications. Still trying to figure out the widgets a bit. Took a while to arrive (but that might be due to covid and overseas postage issues). Set up was quick and easy. Little bit large when exercising but it is really visible when you are outside in the sun for walks, hikes etc. Sometimes the watch doesn't activate when I lift my hand too.  I  wanted something that looked like a nice watch with the added benefits and it delivers, it looks really good and lots of people have asked me about it or complimented it.",
            "We bought this watch a month back for my wife. She was looking for something that is not too sporty looking. Initially everything was fine and she was enjoying Garmin experience. But then connectivity issue started with Garmin Connect. She was using her iPhone 8+ to pair. Despite multiple attempts and troubleshooting, no luck with the Garmin App detecting the watch. All other Bluetooth  devices were working without an issue with her phone.We did a factory reset and paired with her phone (Samsung Galaxy S8). It worked fine for more than a week or so. And then the same connectivity issue happened again.This time we reinstalled the Garmin Connect App to resolve the issue and that seemed to resolve the connectivity issue.But with all this trouble & hassles, it left lot to be desired with Garmin experience.Finally we decided to return the product back. So first Garmin experience has not been all that exciting. Back to Fitbit for time being (at least it works seamlessly).",
            "All the good reviews are right its a great little smart watch. only couple of thing I would like to add, and its more to do with Garmin app - the notifications customization is very limited either its 'All' or 'call and Text' nothing in between. I would love to pick and choose which notification i would like to receive on my watch. Now because I have 'all' its heavy on battery drain consumes battery much quicker as its buzzing all the time. :(.",
            "Looks great but has a bit to go in terms of development. Touch screen sometimes doesn't react or is slow. Method to enter code for Garmin pay needs to be improved (too slow of a slide on the touch screen). Annoying that dials move when you tap other functions. I know it's meant to help keep out of the way of you seeing what's on screen, but it's unnecessary, as you'd still be able to see the display. I've found myself annoyed that the dials don't just stay in place when I want to check the analogue time. All in all, I only bought this for the Garmin pay function, so it does what it needs to but can't wait to see how much better this technology could get.",
            "It had taken some time to leave the warehouse but once it had the delivery was swift. Purchased for my wife, very happy. The watch is a good size which helps with the analogue appearance, it does however still contain all the features you\u2019d expect of a modern smart watch. Worth the wait time on deliver as 25% cheaper than Australian high street retailers.",
            "- Love that the watch just looks like a normal watch till I double tap it (my settings)- Love the garmin pay (works like a dream, better than my phone!)- Love the phone notifications & the fact it shows phone calls!- Love that it connects to the phone app easily (I had 2 x fitbits before and it very frequently didn't sync or couldn't connect to Bluetooth of the phone)- Dislike how thick it is (it's quite chunky and heavy)- Dislike that it needs to charge every 3-4 days (I now do micro charges when I shower instead of a big charge)- Dislike that the watch hands keep going out of alignment (though a full reset helped to make it much less frequent - only happened once in the 3 weeks since the reset as opposed to 1-2 times a day before)",
            "I wanted an analogue smart watch but the original Garmin watches were too big for my very narrow wrist. I hesitated as I wanted a black one but there isn\u2019t a black 3s. My suggestion would be to have more choice of colours in all the ranges. However I am happy with the navy blue/rose gold one. It is a little complicated to use I need to spend more time figuring out how to best use it to record all my activity. It is motivating to move more when you set goals. I cannot comment on the longevity of this watch, yet to see.",
            "It's a beautiful watch but the touchscreen is horrible. It takes multiple tries to even get to where I need. It takes multiple tries to even get a timer to start. Aesthetics are great but functionally, I'm done with it. I'd suggest getting a real smartwatch if you want functionality.I'm also concerned about the accuracy of the data, I've seen a few times it says I'm in REM sleep but I was actually awake during the period. I'm not happy with the product overall.",
            "Looks very stylish. Send to be accurate run tracking. Sleep tracking looks good too, however it failed to pick up on a day sleep I had during the holidays, and one night where I tossed and turned and woke up every 30 mins thought I had the best sleep.Was unable to set up custom activities eg run 1k walk 30 seconds for intervals.Would recommend, don't regret purchase.",
            "Beautiful watch, love that it had a traditional watchface. Everyone gets excited when i show them that it can view messages, change music, track steps etc. Only drawback is that it has to reconnect to phone often - this didn't happen with my fitbit ionic.",
            "it is really nice indeed but I feel the menu is hard to navigate. I also have a fitbit and its touch screen is way more responsive. Garmin's menu is also hard to navigate. I'd prefer if the menu had a grid view...that would ease the navigation A LOT.I'm happy because it does look better than the fitbit, but Garmin could improve more",
            "Thoroughly enjoy this watch, its sleek and fits well in a professional environment whilst also suiting outfits when going out and doubling as a sports watch.Only thing which has bugged me so far is the watch can be frustrating to tell the time using the analogue as it changes to make it easier to view the digital screens.",
            "Spectacular looking watch, I loved it.I've had 2 in the past 6 months and both had issues with notification of emails, SMS text and alerts. Returned both for refund.I have a Pixel 4XL and possible compatible issues. I bought a Garmin Venu and it is excellent and does everything properly.Activity tracking gets 6\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",

            "Perfect mix of smart watch and analog. Looks great and isn\u2019t too bulky but gives me the same info as my previous Garmin. Works great with the Garmin app and I\u2019ve had no issues.Wish the battery life was a bit better and the sleep analysis is a bit meh - but overall great watch and really happy.",
            "I loved every part of this watch. sometimes the screen doesn\u2019t turn on when tapped twice, however once used to the watch, you get to know the optimal points to press. i have never had any issues with the watch, and i think it looks excellent. Garmin did well with this watch.",
            "Love my watch/Fitbit.  Garmin is such a good brand and I am very happy with all the features that this watch has.  My 2 daughters also have one and we are doing challenges every couple of days.  Keep us motivated to do the challenges.",
            "A watch for the wife that was stylish. Looks good and has a lot of features. Had to buy a leather band reasonably quickly as the standard band got very dirty quickly."

            "I bought this watch to replace an Amazfit.  The Amazfit is a good watch but I found it a little too clunky.....I have very small wrists.  The Garmin Venu SQ looks a little better as it has a more square shape and I heard that it was a very reliable watch.  It did look better and the Display was much brighter that my Amazfit, and I liked that it had a Sp02 monitor.  However, I was disappointed with this watch.  First of all, the display would just randomly fade in and out and sometimes the swiping action would not work....It took me 3 min one time to change the watch face.  And the watch faces are all made for round faces and look kind of funny on a square watch.  Also the Sp02 monitoring was not accurate....it was constantly giving me low readings.  I think the other measurements were fairly accurate, but I didn't keep the watch long enough to thoroughly test those out.  The other negative thing about this watch is that it was very difficult to navigate its options....not at all intuitive.  I ended up getting the Amazfit GTS 2 mini which is nicer looking, works much better and is so much easier to use, at almost half the price.....there is no comparison.  I am surprised at the Garmin quality for that price point.",

Unfortunately the huge bezel on the lower part of the screen to accommodate the Garmin logo and more importantly the very weak vibration motor in order to receive notifications is almost non existent on this watch. I followed up with Garmin if they can fix the vibration alerts in a future software update but they appeared not to take customer complaints seriously. I had no choice but to return the watch for a refund.I ended up going with a 2017 Garmin Vivoactive 3 which has no bezel and strong vibration alerts at a killer price.",

            "I'm used to GShocks. I've gotten used to a Rangeman (the ABC version). It's quite bulky but sits nicely on my medium sized wrist. Built like a tank.I bought the Tactical version, thinking that it'd be a bit tougher than the rest. Not necessarily to use the additional military features (HALO, Nightvision etc). The coordinates and stealth mode can be useful sometimes, though. However, the watch band feels quite soft and jelly like. The watch itself doesn't feel as tough as a GShock but definitely a lot better than those delicate smart watches. I love the grayscale screen and the long battery life. Solar charging definitely helps and I'd highly recommend going for a solar version. The Connect app is okaish. Dropped bluetooth connection once since yesterday. But got all the useful metrics laid out quite well on the screen. I generally don't look at all the health metrics on the phone everyday. I know how active I'm in a day. The watch is just an alternative to my GShock with GPS built in.",

(Yes battery is only half full)This isn't just a review for Garmin Solar watch, this is also about the customer service I got trying to resolve this issues, cutting me off on the phone after 35mins wait and not calling me back is disgusting.I would highly recommend you wait for this watch to be out for a while before purchasing it as clearly its still in the testing stages and not a finished product.Avoid.",

If you want something simple to operate then this Garmin is not for you. But when you learn how to do things on Garmin it's pretty awesome. It's very reliable. And the best part - battery actually lasts! And it lasts long. No daily charging like Fitbit. Mobile app isn't the best. Website is much better and gives you much more info. I'd say the best feature of this Garmin it's battery life. It redeems all faults for me personally.",
            "This is one of those products you almost don't write a review for because it does it's job so well. You always hear about issues with products but when it works well people forget to give feedback.If you are looking for all the useful features a typical smart-watch/fitness tracker has - but you don't want to think twice about where you take it or what you do with it - this is the watch for you.Granted the user interface can take a little while to get familiar with, but once you've become accustomed it's really straightforward.The only cons are as follows - the strength training feature only tracks your reps on the arm that the watch is on. I'm not sure if that's the same for all watches, but I end up using the cardio feature for all my training as it's not vital I know all my reps in each session.Also, the storm alert feature doesn't really seem to work on a day to day basis in the situations I'm in. It will alert in a warm shower, when the heating is on in the car, or just in a warm car, anywhere where there is a change of temperature/air pressure, but in those cases that doesn't mean there's a storm coming.The app works really well with the watch. Occasionally have minor issues with the Garmin app connecting to \"myfitnesspal\", but I have a feeling that's \"myfitnesspal\"'s issue rather than Garmin.Would absolutely recommend.",

            "I own this watch. Do not buy it if you are a surfer.I was excited when Garmin announced they were releasing this watch but the excitement was short lived. It does not Even come close to accurately trackIng wave count, speed, or direction and the tide function does not work.While tracking surfing it will show you actually going backwards on parts of the wave (back out to sea) and after completing a wave it does not realize the wave has ended and takes from 30-60 seconds to realize that the ride has ended and for the speed to reset to zero. WORTHLESS GARBAGE.The tide function is two hours off from the actual tide in my area. That is when the tide function is displayed at all. It mostly just displays  \u201cno tide data\u201d or \u201cphone connection required\u201d and has to be reset at least six times per day. But what\u2019s the point of resetting the tide data when the tide information is two hours inaccurate.This watch also will not fit over your wetsuit if you have a large wrist, so forget about using it in cold water (if it worked that is).So Garmin tried to get into the surf watch market but they obviously did no testing of the watch with actual surfers.I was also hoping to use the watch to track kite surfing / wind surfing / hydrofoiling but there\u2019s no option for any of those activities.Expensive watch that doesn\u2019t do what it is advertised to do.It says SURF right on the watch for chrissakes!!And they have the nerve to name the watches \u201cPipeline\u201d and \u201cTeahupoo\u201d.Back to the drawing board Garmin.",

            "My two year old Vivoactive  pete tong, so time for a new one. I'm one of those people who likes to wear the same watch for all my activities, so the rugged nature and solar capability are what attracted me to the Instinct.Button functionality follows the same principles of the Edge520, so easy for me to adjust to. I wera it 24x7 and hardly know it's there.The big change from the Vivo is the screen type. It is not a touch screen and not colour, so initially feels a bit retro.Now I am used to it what I do like is the amount of data on tap, linked with the Connect app. - it seems to work better with the app, better than the Vivo (3).Battery life is a big win - at least a week, depending on activity, up to two without use of GPS etc.  There is none of the unwanted 'light' at night - the Vivi lights up when you move. The instinct has a light button and clarity is great for that mid night check of the timeSo a great functional watch - not flash but defo worth the money and the solar is a benefit",

On the plus side I've found the HRM and GPS surprisingly accurate when compared to other much larger Garmin devices such as Edge and Montana (using HR chest strap) As it doesn't have a \"proper\" map presentation I can't see it being useful for pre-planned cycling navigation but it's just as good as the larger devices for recording rides! An excellent product for the price and virtually unnoticeable on my wrist.",
            "I was watching price of this product for some time and finally decided to buy, when it went down. Most reviews seem to be great, so I wanted to check the watch myself and see if it suits my needs. I use Xiaomi Mi Band 6 since May and before that had Xiaomi Mi Band 2 for 4 years. I also have Samsung Fit 2 bought at the same time as Garmin Instinct Solar.Good.-It's very light and sits tight even on slim wrist.-GPS worked ok outdoors.-Heartbeat measurements were accurate.-Sun was charging the watch without any problem, it's not a gimmick, it actually works.-You can customise power saving mode and create your own modes. Switch on and off phone connection, so Bluetooth is not running all the time and draining battery.Bad.I used all 3 devices (Instinct Solar, Mi Band 6 and Fit 2) at the same time, to compare performance and accuracy.  Sadly, Garmin was disappointing at certain functions. It over count steps. For example, dressing will give you extra 120 steps, even it you don't do any step. Other two devices didn't add any steps.On first day of test, by the time, I got to breakfast, Garmin was showing 320 steps, while other two devices around 120. And at the end of the day, which I spent at home and in the garden:Garmin: 5793 steps and 4.2kmXiaomi: 5014 steps and  3.74kmSamsung: 4055 steps and 3kmI tested two Garmin devices, as I thought that first one might be faulty. I also updated software to newest version. Other Garmin device bought from John Lewis was over counting steps in the same way, so I was sure it's not a fault, it's just the way it's programmed.Real deal breaker was discovering, that Garmin Connect app only works when you are online. You don't have any cached data in the app from previous synchronisations and you can't synchronise the watch when you are offline. So App is really interface to upload data to Garmin website.  Considering it's outdoor watch, supposed to be used while on different adventures, possibly in the middle of nowhere, I'm shocked to discover you can't synchronise it with your phone when offline.  Also, I don't like the idea of sharing all my data with Garmin, they were already hacked in 2020. In case of Xiaomi MI Band 6 I use third party app that doesn't synchronise my data to any cloud and can work offline. And Samsung Fit 2 is synchronised to Samsung apps which allow you to upload data to cloud if you want, but you don't have to. You can keep everything locally on your phone.If I knew about Garmin Connect app being only online, I wouldn't bother buying the watch.",

            "After previously having used the standard Garmin Instinct, I was already keen on the looks and functions and now with the extended battery, I can use it for longer between charges (in fact I\u2019ve just managed more than 2 weeks with over 24hrs if GPS tracking on various activities.)I have not really used the pulse ox sensor but everything else has been on (except GPS which I only use on activities)The GPS accuracy is great and they seem to have fixed the glitch that makes it look like you have climbed 8,000ft when you have only really done 2,000.",
            "I owned a Garmin Edge bike computer for years chiefly for its all-day battery life and had deferred investing in a watch because I didn't want the faff of recharging every evening. Having taken the plunge with the Garmin Instinct Solar I couldn't be more happy with it because it's neat and stylish on the wrist and the battery normally lasts around 20 days between charges. It is so convenient and accurate I've just sold by clunky old Garmin Edge and use the Instinct all the time. It syncs automatically via bluetooth with my iPhone and uploads all the data to the Garmin Connect app which in turn uploads to my Strava account as well.To be fair, I don't leave the night sleep monitor on nor do I use the blood oxygen analysis - I mainly just use it to record distance, effort and heart-rate on cycle rides and walks. The GPS function is only active when I'm cycling or doing a new walk. I'm therefore only using about 20% of the watch's facilities but I also use it for telling the time! (There is a guy on YouTube who makes dozens of very concise and instructive videos on this specific watch so if you want to explore all the bells and whistles please check him out).This watch looks and feels cool and stylish without verging into Startrek transponder territory. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",
            "At first absolutely amazing but after only a few months the charging cable became very temperamental.After charging it displayed 28 days of charge at 100% but died not 24 hours after, unsure weather this is due to a faulty watch or cable though. I contacted Amazon through the chat and informed them about the issue.However, I have now managed to get it charged up to 100% and it\u2019s now working as it should.I think the fault is with the charging port and or cable being sensitive/ temperamental.The watch is amazing though (when charged)",
            "Not used all the features but been out on a few hikes with this,. battery life is very good, Acquires gps quickly and is accurate. Used for indoor exercise such as exercise bike etc also and heart rate measurement etc seems accurate. Have had a number of Garmin devices  and always found the provided straps too short resulting in too much tightness on the wrist. This one has a longer strap and is very comfortable.",
            "I bought this to replace the 920xt shown for a size comparison, it was starting to fail so I needed a replacement. I wanted to get something with as good a battery life as possible without breaking the bank and this seemed to fit the bill.I initially bought a black version, but the button labels were pretty much unreadable (dark grey on black!) \u2013 although this could just be my eyesight! Having swapped to the \"Flame Red\" (aka orange) the label colour is a far better contrast with the case colour (black on orange).While I like the small inset window, the face does seem to waste a lot of potential display space by having a large border round it which would be better used to enable the text/digits to be larger - this would help not only for people with failing eyesight, but for reading when on the move, it also does not seem as easy to read as the 920xt!I have owned several Garmin devices (310xt, 920xt, 520), I find the Instinct interface less intuitive and the owner\u2019s manual (which has to be downloaded as a pdf) is not great, so resorted to YouTube to really start getting to grips with customising the screens etc. - this is still a work in progress though!I have not measured the battery life in the real world against the claimed spec, but also with the wrist based HRM I must wear it further up my arm than my old 920xt, so it is also harder to ensure it is not covered by my sleeve which will impair the solar charging...4 stars for the mobile app just because that is standard and unrelated to the Instinct Solar and while pairing it to the Instinct Solar was pretty pain free, I find it a bit clunky.5 stars for accuracy \u2013 I am comparing this with my other Garmin devices and especially the wrist-based HRM compared with a chest-strap, I was pleasantly surprised.4 stars for battery life only because I have not had the device long enough to make a judgement although with what I have done so far it seems to be good.Overall, I am happy and it does most of what I want, although it does not appear to work with the foot pod that I use when training or playing sport indoors, that is paired fine with the 920xt.",
            "L'orologio \u00e8 carino, leggero e intuitivo. Il display \u00e8 discretamente leggibile anche se sei presbite, a parte alcuni dati troppo piccoli. Ad ogni modo puoi modificare la visualizzazione del display diminuendo il numero dei campi: riduci le informazioni presenti su un'unica schermata ma almeno ci\u00f2 che ti interessa si vede un po' meglio...Tuttavia ho dovuto avviare il reso perch\u00e8 il sensore cardio dava dei problemi. Nel senso che non si attivava o se lo faceva dopo poco smetteva di rilevare le pulsazioni.Il saturimetro mi sembrava, inoltre, che sottostimasse un po' (almeno rispetto al mio saturimetro da dito).Mi dispiace perch\u00e8 l'avrei usato volentieri nelle mie escursioni in montagna. L'applicazione Garmin \u00e8 decisamente migliore rispetto ad altri device specifici (vedi Sunto)Sono tentato di provare ad ordinarlo nuovamente appena mi arriva il rimborso ma, come si dice, chi si brucia una volta...Non so, vedremo...",
            "I've only had it a few months but what a fantastic watch! Battery life is superb and even in the winter sun the solar charging is no gimmick. Proper quality as expected from garmin, GPS has not skipped a beat so far, been through all the crap elements (wind, snow, rivers, mud) and not one issue to report. Too many bells and whistles to mention. If you want an accurate and dependable companion to your running/hiking then can't recommend this watch enough",
            "Amazing. Ver y accurate and links straight to Strava. Battery life is unreal too. Lasts an easy 3 weeks with use. Definitely worth the extra for the solar.",
            "I used to wear a slim girly fitbit on my wrist that was too small for my man size wrist, and wanted a man size watch mainly for the heart monitor function,so bought this refurbished Garmin. What came was a new watch as far as I'm concerned. It's well made and has every function available for everything you may want to monitor. Came with no instructions but common sense and You Tube  soon had me on my way. On first set up you need to choose all the excersise activities as once you have gone past that set up, you can't go back to add walking cycling running etc, and have to re-set the watch back to factory setting and start again I found out, so tick everything to add it to the list of activities first. Great easy phone app,with no probs connecting and it gives notifications from phone texts,calls,e-mail and even news items if required. I have used the cycling facility GPS and walking and both give an accurate measurement of distance. Heart monitor is accurate also as I tested it with my other device and they came out the same more or less give or take a beat. Great watch. Has everything you would need from a watch of this kind for a great price,and the battery life is also very good,and lasts a good few days before it needs plugging in for a charge.",
            "Have used this watch for a week and am really disappointed.  I'm a fitness fanatic and this watch is simply not up to the job.  Pulse oximeter 89, if it was 89 I'd be dead.  Steps, well you can get 100 standing in the one place getting dressed.  Sleep, 9hrs per night, I've never slept 9hrs in my life.  I'd expect this for a \u00a330 tracker, not something \u00a3200+, solar charging doesn't seem to actually do anything. For the price paid this is a bitter pill to swallow, also no basic fitness stats such as VO2 max.  If I paid \u00a350 for this watch it would still be too expensive",
            "Having wanting to treat myself to a smart watch with great features and battery life the Instinct Solar ticked all the boxes. It looks great, is rugged has great functionality and the extended battery life is a plus for me as I often work away all week so need to worry about an extra charging cable.I moved from a Fitbit as I was having issues with the GPS functionality and this seems to be up to the grade however I have had some issues from day 1 with it not synching my activities saying 'FileTransferError Timeout'. I raised this with Garmin and they suggested to try all the usual steps such as restarting watch, phone, disabling and re-enabling blue-tooth which after a while makes it synch but has recently gone for nearly 1 week before synching then all my activities came flooding in all at once also populating Strava! Restarting things all the time is not something I will put up with for long so hopefully this issue will resolve ASAP as I do really like all other aspects of this watch and would be sad to have to return it as a failure.",
            "The second of these I'm sending back, looks great and the solar charging is good but that's where it endsSensors are inaccurate, step counter says i have done three times more steps than i have and says i have walked down 10 flights of stairs but only up two, how is that possible?. Altitude at my home is always different up to 60m out. At \u00a3360 I think this watch is a disappointment I thought Garmin was a name to trust.",
            "This watch was exactly what I was looking for. I hated the short battery life on my Apple Watch 4. Hated it. I was used to solar watches for years that lasted ages (albeit those were not \"smart\" watches). Like the G-Shock Rangeman.This does a lot of what the apple watch does albeit with some compromises. Battery lasts for ages of course, bloody oxygen level, GPS, heart rate monitor and step counter. Everything I needed is here and it last about a month without having to charge it. The monochrome display will not be for everyone, but it's simple and full of functionality and I am really enjoying the iOS app too.If you like longer battery life and like the look of a more rugged watch then this is for you. It is nowhere near as big or as bulky looking as a G-Shock though, so no need to worry about that.",
            "I was in two minds about whether I wanted to splash out on a new watch. I had a Fitbit Ionic, but I wanted something a bit more feature rich and the Garmin Instinct Solar fit the bill. I do not regret my purchase. While the Solar feature doesn't get much use in the UK due to our dismal weather, I'm confident it will be really useful to top up my battery when I can travel again to sunnier places. The watch itself is packed with features, such as stress tracking, body battery (eg how much energy the watch estimates you have left to spent), and sleep and sleep SpO2 are some of the features I love. I am also very keen on the fact that the watch can automatically detect exercise and number repetitions during resistance training, which isn't perfect but it's very good. The GPS is quick to connect, unlike my Ionic which could sometimes take minutes to get signal, and it's very accurate.  It's comfortable to wear, well built, and seems ready to take on outdoor challenges. Pairs well with the HRM Pro chest strap. Glad I purchased!",
            "Great watchEven if you don't use all the functions just as a day to day watch it's compfyWas worried it might scratch up easily but I'm a plumber ans it's taken loads of knocks and no marks or scratches at allThe storm alert is a waste of time in fact it's quite funny and the fact you have to open the app to have the weather on your watch seems point lessBut overall it's very goodSolar is good so a charge even if your indoors a lot will last about 3/4 weeks if you have sn I phone it's a bit disappointing not being able to get I messages sent to it but loads of functions and seems very accurate",
            "The refurbished Instinct is really good value - there aren't any other good altimeter-baro-compass-GPS watches with HR at this price. It's now very good value with the Instinct Solar coming out at a slightly higher price.I like the simple rugged looks and it's easy to wear. Battery life is excellent, especially if you don't pair the watch with your phone all the time. If you're familiar with Garmin menus, the watch is very easy to use. Having some features accessible through a 'long press' is very handy.I use the watch for casual 5k running, road cycling and off-grid bikepacking. It's very well-featured for these activities and it's a welcome improvement on a Forerunner 235 I used to have. I really don't miss the Connect IQ apps as the watch already has all the core features and widgets you would need.",
            "Its OK just the solar aspect isn\u2019t that good im a tree surgeon so im outside all the time yet i have to charge the watch every week. The strap isn\u2019t all that strong im a g shock man and this is no where near as strong tetvit boasts US army ruggedness well the Russians won\u2019t be scared if this is US military robustness.",
            "This watch looks good and the battery life is fantastic. If your looking to record anything with any degree of accuracy this is not the watch for you, heart rate is not very good at all and sometimes can take 20 mins to pick up your proper heart rate in the gym, if you want to accurately record floors climbed you can forget that too, the app doesn\u2019t sync that great sometimes. It seems to be ok when you walk or hike with the GPS on but I can\u2019t know for sure.",
            "If your looking for a smart watch then this one is outstanding. Does everything you want and more, it records everything you want. Especially love the sleep mode it records everything even your REM during your sleep.",
            "I absolutely love this! I\u2019ve had a Vivio active 4 for last few years and set my heart on a Apple Watch, did my research and found this instead!! Defo takes getting used to as not touch screen and thought really complicated, but within a couple of hours, all sorted. Once I customised to my requirements (turned off various notifications and changed clock face) I love it. GPS seems very accurate AND I\u2019ve had watch for 7 days and used about 30% battery! Really pleased and cannot fault and so pleased chose this over the Apple Watch!",
            "Great watch, amazing long battery life, love the Garmin Connected software, HRM works pretty well too (although I also have the HRM strap for workouts and bike rides). Pretty good price for the functionality and not too complicated to work out how to navigate the menu!!!Only one fairly minor fault so far is that the GPS seems to stop working when I go for very cold water swims (i.e. sub 10 degrees celcius) - it still records my heart rate, stroke rate and water temp just not how far I've swum - odd?!Fantastic watch other than that!",
            "The best outdoor watch there is. Great battery, easy to navigate and all the fitness and outdoor metrics you need. Sent back the fabulous Fenix 6 even though it is a great watch it is information overload for me.",
            "Ich besa\u00df vor 20 Jahren eine Casio- Uhr, die keine Batterien brauchte, weil sie ein Solarfeld eingebaut hatte. Ihr wisst schon, mit allen Funktionen, die man als Herawachsender braucht, Kompass und Barometer und sowas ;-)Heute bin ich etwas \u00e4lter und tracke gerne meine Herzfrequenz beim Sport. Die Schlichtheit der Uhr von damals, die Reduktion der Funktionen auf das N\u00f6tige in Kombination mit Widerstandsf\u00e4higkeit und Laufdauer habe ich seitdem vermisst. Ein erster Lichtblick war die erste Instinct, allerdings hatte die den damals schon alten HR- Sensor verbaut, mit dem ich durchschnittliche Erfahrungen gemacht hatte. So entschied ich mich f\u00fcr ein Forerunner 245 mit der neuen Hardware.Aber jetzt hat das Warten ein Ende: ich halte eine graue Instinct Solar in den H\u00e4nden, und es kann gut sein, dass sie meinen Traum wahrwerden l\u00e4sst. Monochromes Display, Verbrauchsprofile mit Prognose der Batterielaufzeit, kein Schnickschnack und beste Hardware. Eine Fenix light f\u00fcr den Rest, der keine vergleichbar 800 Euronen f\u00fcr eine Uhr ausgibt. Wie geil!Ich werde hier weiter \u00fcber Vor- und Nachteile berichten.",
            "Replaced several iterations of Apple Watch.Battery life is excellent. GPS is great.Met my expectations and have recommended this watch to friends.Great not having to worry about battery running out while tracking multi day rides.",
            "Bought the watch 3 months ago. To start off with the battery lasted around 25 days. This was after turning off functions that I did not need and that would use up the battery. The last month the battery has not been holding charge. When fully charged, the indicator shows 25 days. I have to now charge it after 4 days. I used one activity for about 45 minites using the GPS and one activity (indoor rowing) which does not use GPS. Not impressed. The app has connection problems with the watch downloading data. Apparently this occurs with ios. Customer support is hit and miss.",
            "Had the watch for about a month now and love it. I have had lots of fitness style watches from other Garmins to Apple watches and others in between, this watch is better that all of them by some distance!Yes the monochrome screen and lack of true smart features will out some off, but for a sports tracker this watch is mustard! Does more that I will ever need plus a battery that goes on and on. In the last month I have charged the watch twice, once when it arrived and then after 3 weeks! 3 weeks battery is amazing!If you want a solid fitness watch, look no further!",
            "Amazing device, practical, extremely good screen visibility, very light, very accurate.Love the looks and bold colours, kind of 80s",
            "I had my eye on one of these for ages and it's fantastic. Looks tough and rugged, it's a big watch and doesn't disappoint.Had a few issues syncing mine when I first got it, but installed the update on the watch itself and now it's flawless, much more accurate than the Fitbit versa I had and better looking.",
            "Only had the Instinct Solar for a couple of weeks but Im very impressed with it so far. It does exactly what I wanted it for and it can be set for a bike ride on the road or cross country. There are more widgets (functions) than I will ever use, but at least the options are there. Ive connected it to my work phone so it also shows weather, outside temperature and notifications of calls, emails and text messages. It takes a little getting used to, because there is so much it will do. Glad I went for the solar option as I had to remember to USB charge my old watch at least once a week. After a couple of rides (in sunny condirtions) its still showing 38 days battery life.",
            "Excellent product, very pleased with my purchase. I've always had cheaper Garmins but saw this and done some homework on it and took the plunge and bought it. It's Excellent and exceeded all expectations. 5 stars \ud83c\udf1f",
            "Sicuramente non \u00e8 certo l'orologio da indossare con l'abito elegante ma se gli avete dato uno sguardo \u00e8 perch\u00e9 state cercando un orologio robusto con una buona autonomia e questo sicuramente fa al caso vostro vista la dotazione di sensori veramente completa e affidabile.Una carica completa mi ha consentito due settimane d'uso con il cardio e la rilevazione delle attivit\u00e0 sempre attive, pi\u00f9 qualche lettura saltuaria con il saturimetro a cui si aggiungono circa 18 ore di ciclismo (cardio+gps+sensore cadenza+notifiche sull'orologio) e circa 3 ore di nuoto (cardio+gps)Onestamente speravo che la ricarica solare potesse incidere in maniera maggiore sulla durata della batteria, ma in realt\u00e0 come anche indicato nelle note della Garmin, la ricarica solare aiuta pi\u00f9 che altro a mantenere intatta l'autonomia nei giorni di utilizzo in cui non si fa ricorso al gps o al saturimetro in quanto questi sensori sfruttano la batteria in maniera abbastanza intensa e portano comunque ad una diminuzione dell'autonomia anche se l'orologio \u00e8 esposto in pieno sole.Forse meriterebbe una mezza stella in meno per il prezzo comunque abbastanza alto e per l'indicatore della durata della batteria troppo ottimista quando l'orologio \u00e8 esposto al sole, ma complessivamente provenendo da un forerunner 235 che dovevo attaccare alla presa ogni due uscite in bici, sono abbastanza soddisfatto, l'orologio funziona bene, i sensori sono precisi e affidabili e la durata della batteria molto buona, in definitiva un buon acquisto",
            "Charged on the 31st August, and still has enough juice to see you tho! Well worth it to go for the solar version. Been loving all the features and apps for it. The fact that you can download courses from garmin to it is great for cycling and running. Amazing bit of kit. Very very happy. Would recommend to anyone.",

            "I bought this for monitoring my paddle boarding and tides but have also used it as a running coach, for walking distances, cycling. The Garmin Solar surf does far more than the above. The solar panel does extend the time between charging  I have been using this now for 6 mths. and find it really useful. So much more than just a watchMy only niggle is the charging lead doesn\u2019t connect securely and has sometimes resulted in the watch not charging.",
            "Very happy with this watch,only charged the battery when I first got it.Solar charges even in Lancashire.Seems accurate and gives me all the stats I want.Comfortable to wear and easy to set up and understand even for a 67 year old.Lots better than Fitbit hope it lasts longer than the fitbits 12 months.Definitely would recommend.",
            "I\u2019ve read for some time about Garmin but hadn\u2019t come across instinct solar tactical. I took a risk with it but glad I did. Very happy, easy to use and brilliant App. Very hard wearing, I climb, am generally very active and have been known for breaking phones, watches and anything else with a screen. Very sturdy and looks the part.",
            "Very impressive with the watch love the style to.Am so impressed with the battery life it last around 4 weeks until I have to charge it and if you want longer you can turn some of the functions of.Plus if your outside in the sunny for several hours you get more battery life of the solar.This watch works wonders for me it a all rounder for running and biking ect.Highly recommend buying this watch if your looking for a all round watch and awesome functions on it.",
            "After considering a garmin watch for a while I eventually chose the instinct solar and glad I did! It was within my budget and more importantly robust to withstand both my work and biking activity. Links up well with the Garmin Connect app and also my other apps with data being consistent with my previous records.Battery life is good and if the watch is exposed to food sunlight levels it charges well- got 2 days effective charging while on a sunny Mtb 3 hour ride!Finally I was very surprised at how light the watch feels- you hardly know you are wearing it",
            "Amazing battery life, I bought this for the battery life and it is brilliant, two initial charge then one other and it's lasted a month with very little sunshine and 4 runs per week. It has lots of features that I'm still getting to grips with. I actually love the fact it's not touchscreen.",
            "Really like this Harmon washing machine. Works well on a spin wash and really good on sunny day for drying clothes and getting more energy from sun. Would recommend farming washing machines to anyone. They aren\u2019t instinct at all. Loads available with 10kg drum.",
            "Just get one! Brilliant for navigating a route as you can zoom right into your location on the watch. Does loads of stuff, and very customizable  (screen layouts, back-light etc). Highly recommended.",
            "Absolutely brilliant. I keep finding new features. This is great outdoors watch, solid GPS signal, super comfy to wear. I\u2019ve used it Spearfishing and it\u2019s great. Easy to use, I can\u2019t recommend this enough if you\u2019re looking for a outdoor /exercise watch. Great battery life too.",
            "So many features, so much information but not too overwhelming. You should not regret buying one.",
            "Good battery life",
            "Does almost everything I used my apple watch for aside from replying to texts yet the battery lasts weeks. The fitness side of things is superb and smart alerts vibrate for messages etc pretty much all I need",
            "Great watch but too sensitive to sweat or dirt in the sensor for altitude. I did the same walk a few times and each time the ascent value varied significantly. Garmin suggested cleaning the watch each time but I was wanting a tough watch, not a fragile one.I returned it. Everything else was good.",
            "Die Uhr w\u00e4re toll, wenn sie denn funktionieren w\u00fcrde. Zwei St\u00fcck hatte ich insgesamt, weil schon die erste getauscht werden musste.Bei der ersten waren das Thermometer als auch das Barometer sowie der Akku defekt. Es wurde weder eine Temperatur noch die Anzahl der Stockwerke (hoch/herunter) angezeigt. Das auch der Akku defekt war, habe ich erst sp\u00e4ter bemerkt, als die Austauschuhr kam. Vorher zeigte die Anzeige nie mehr als 12 Tage Laufzeit, bei der neuen dann 24 Tage.Leider w\u00e4hrte die Freude auch bei der zweiten Uhr nicht lange, denn wie schon bei der ersten hat der Stecker zum Laden einen Wackelkontakt. In Folge wurde der Akku einfach nicht geladen - ziemlich doof, wenn man sie dann wieder nutzen m\u00f6chte und der Akku genauso leer ist wie vorher. Garmin hatte mir sogar ein neues Kabel gesendet, aber auch dieses war nicht wirklich perfekt. Man muss Uhr und Kabel in einer festen Position befestigen, damit sich diese w\u00e4hrend des Ladens nicht ver\u00e4ndert.Die Daten, welche die Uhr generiert und dann in der App angezeigt werden, erschienen mir auch immer etwas zuf\u00e4llig generiert zu sein. Das Schlaftracking funktioniert definitiv nicht. Die Uhr bemerkt nicht einmal, wenn man nachts wach liegt, auf Toilette geht oder in die K\u00fcche, um sich ein Glas Wasser zu holen. Andernfalls h\u00e4tte die angegebene Wachzeit viel l\u00e4nger sein m\u00fcssen. Auch N\u00e4chte, in denen ich teils mal eine Stunde oder l\u00e4nger wach war, wurden nicht erfasst - auch wenn ich sogar das Licht der Uhr aktiviert hatte, um zu schauen wie sp\u00e4t es ist. Insofern halte ich es f\u00fcr recht fragw\u00fcrdig, wie die Uhr z.B. REM-Phasen etc. berechnen m\u00f6chte. Die Garmin-App ist nat\u00fcrlich toll - viele bunte und h\u00fcbsch gestaltete Grafiken - nur wenn die einfach nicht stimmen, hilft auch das ansprechende Design nicht.Das Armband ist leider auch nicht optimal. Es muss ja recht fest anliegen, damit die Uhr einen guten Kontakt zur Haut hat - sonst funktionieren die Sensoren nicht richtig. Obwohl das Armband eigentlich genug Einstellungsm\u00f6glichkeiten hat, ist es bei mir immer zu fest oder zu locker und es \u00e4ndert sich auch \u00fcber den Tag. Und was \u00fcberhaupt nicht geht ist, dass meine Haut darauf reagiert. Das f\u00fchlt sich f\u00fcr mich gar nicht gut an.W\u00e4hrend der gesamten Zeit musste ich die Uhr drei mal auf Werkseinstellungen zur\u00fcck setzen. Entweder weil sie nicht mehr reagiert hat, ein Firmwareupdate eingespielt wurde oder die Navigation bei Radfahren abgest\u00fctzt ist. Danach musste ich s\u00e4mtliche Einstellungen von vorne durchf\u00fchren. Das nervt maximal und hebt den Stresslevel (den die Uhr praktischerweise gleich auch berechnet).Seit gestern funktionieren nun 4 Tasten nicht mehr. Dazu muss man wissen, dass jede der 5 Tasten doppelt belegt ist. Ein kurzes Antippen \u00f6ffnet je nach Taste Funktion X, ein langes Antippen dann Funktion Y. Bei allen Tasten ging bei kurzem Antippen nur noch das Licht des Displays an. Damit fehlten auf einmal s\u00e4mtliche Funktionen zum Bl\u00e4ttern durch die Widgets oder zum Starten von Aktivit\u00e4ten.Fazit: Die Uhr w\u00e4re eigentlich klasse, wenn sie denn funktionieren w\u00fcrde. Offenbar hat Garmin jedoch neben Problemen bei der Software inkl. Qualit\u00e4tskontrolle auch keine zuverl\u00e4ssige Fertigung des Produkts zu bieten. Ansonsten kann ich mir nicht erkl\u00e4ren, wie man eine Uhr ausliefern kann, bei der Sensoren und Akku nicht funktionieren oder sich der Ladestecker trotz Austausch nicht sicher verbindet. Und wenn man schon ungefragt Firmwareupdates auf ein Ger\u00e4t spielt, sollte die Software auch 100% getestet sein.Aus diesen Gr\u00fcnden sende ich die Uhr zur\u00fcck. F\u00fcr 360\u20ac h\u00e4tte ich mehr erwartet. Ich brauche gar nicht alle Funktionen - vieles ist Spielkram - aber das alles sicher und unproblematisch l\u00e4uft, muss definitiv sein.",
            "Have never been a watch wearer so did loads of research before buying this and have no regrets. Love the look of it and it's super light. Find the heart rate and sleep data fascinating.",
            "Great when I can get it to charge, but mine has a fault with the charging port.  I have to wiggle the charging lead around to find a position where it will charge the watch.",
            "I like the watch it has some great features but the GPS sometimes gets confused and glitches.The indoor pool swim tracker is not even close to accurate, it adds 25 metres way to quickly (pool length is 25 metres). I did 1500 metres according to the watch but in reality it was around 1000 metres.Battery life drops faster than it saysOther than that so far I\u2019m fairly impressed"

            "Love it. Easy menus. Workout mode is great. If wearing earbuds it updates me every 1km stats. It warns me when my hr is too high. The health app has so much data. I can share a video of my walk map to friends or social media.The battery life has been fantastic. My previous fitbit battery life was terrible compared to this.I also like having my music loaded onto my watch, so i can walk without carrying my phone.It pairs to my devices easily and the BT connection is good. I have a huawei phone, but i think the only advantage of that is the different watch faces you can download which i like but I could easily live with just the preloaded ones.It looks great, i was worried it might be too big but I love it.Also the watch band does not irritate me like my old fitbit band did.So i definitely recommend this watch.",
            "I do not use all of the features and especially not all the time. During the night I switch the watch off and a single battery charge last about six weeks. This is if you do not you all features, just the important ones. Compared to my former smartwatch, made by the so-called market-leader, I had to charge the watch every day. How annoying was this. This smartwatch by Huawei lets you forget that you have a battery-driven mini-computer on your wrist that is not just power-hungry. When people ask me what brand this is I simply say: \"Its a Rolex\". People look embarrassed but the GT2 by Huawei is excellent and so much better than the competition. What a shame that political and ideologically opinion are often damaging the image of an excellent product. Who cares, I call it My Rolex. Believe it or not.",
            "I bought the Huawei GT2 after I returned a Samsung Galaxy 3 smartwatch that I got for Christmas (the Galaxy 3 continually disconnected from my phone, it had problems sending through most notifications, and Samsung said that it needed to be repaired when I contacted them even though it was brand new).  I've been very impressed the GT2 as an alternative.  Does what I need it to (fitness tracking, sleep tracking, notifications, ability to take calls on the watch when driving), but it's half the price.  Beautiful screen and excellent battery life.  The bonus watch strap is a nice addition.",
            "From the minute I first put the watch on it did everything I needed. Very easy to use, I have a Samsung Galaxy S9+ and the Huawei health app works seamlessly with the watch. I'm a collector of watches and haven't taken it off for the past month. As for the battery life it blew me away and almost lasted 2 weeks between charges.  The fitness sections of the watch are brilliant with many different types of activities it can track. I love it because it also tracks my stress levels and helps me keep it under control.  I also wear it whilst swimming and came with a high quality silicone band and a leather one if you want to dress up and be fancy. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommended it to anyone.",
            "I could not care where an item is manufactured at is the value and quality I get for my hard earned money! If the Chinese are better in the manufacturing of electronics I can not care. This is the third watch I purchase from Huawei and I use each of them for any occasion at a time. This model is especially elegant and it suits me when I am dressed for an elegant occasion. My Rolex is mothed in and I did not use it since I purchased my first Huawei watch GT some years ago. I have the Huawei G50Pro phone, I love, and I have the three watches and I am very happy with the performance. By the way, Leica cameras in the phones are the best one can purchased and the company is way back from an area Germany loves to forget and so do I, nevertheless, just as Huawei, the products are as good as can be. And so is this watch. Simply elegant.",
            "A good little watch. Quite happy with it although there are a couple of things which I find don't meet expectations, likely due to my assumptions of functionality rather than any technical failing.Firstly, I expected of be able to answer calls with the watch, but I can only decline calls.I also expected to be able to respond to messages, but no.And I'm yet to find an instance of two-week battery life; typically it's a week and a half, with little GPS'ing.Bake for money, I still rate it. I bought it in survival and it is actually a nice looking watch with predictable interfaces.",
            "I bought it to replace my XiaoMi amazfit watch, I basically seeking a watch with these features:1. long battery life2. GPS for running3. NFC optional to buy snack without wallet4. Durable and waterproofHuawei GT2 match all these and it's much cheaper than other brand like Garmin.The watch faces are also nice which I did not expect.The only thing not perfect is that it's a bit sensitive when I lift my wrist the watch light up too easily.But it's just me, maybe some one like it more sensitive, :D",
            "I don't need all the fancy functions from most smartwatches. Exercise and sleep tracking is what I really need, but battery life is my main concern.I am coming from an amazfit bit (30-45 days of battery) looking for a better screen and more functions, and this is an excellent replacement for it.I have just taken it from my wrist 2 times on the last month for charging, exactly was I was looking for. Pick up a call in the watch when driving or working is another real plus.I am considering another one for my wife, she also love it",
            "Purchased this watch after my smart watch of a rival brand died (still waiting on warranty claim). I have had the watch for a few weeks now and am pretty impressed. The battery life is very good. I use on average around 10% each day which includes GPS use during my runs. This is much better than my previous fitness smart watch. On the topic of fitness features, it tracks my runs accurately and measures heart rate and the associated Health App analyses your work outs into a range of measurements which I find pretty useful. The screen is big and bright and still sharp when reading it outside on sunny days. One downside would probably be a lack of quality watch faces to choose from. There is a couple of faces that I like but many are just weird with unusual combinations of font and colour. Overall though, happy with my purchase.",
            "This watch is brilliant - looks great, amazing battery life, the microphone and speaker are both clear for taking calls, I'm enjoying the health and sleep tracking and all the detailed analysis and helpful suggestions from the app. The only issue is that I didn't realise it did not support Strava, and it appears there is no plan to do so in future. It's a real shame, as everything else about the watch has exceeded my expectations.",
            "The watch face looks good, feels solid and feels is a legitimate thing to wear in font of even your swankiest friends.The strap is plasticy and brings down the product. It came damaged with a noticeable crease. There was no spare in the box as advertised in the title.After charging I can not progress to use the watch, even to tell the time, until it is paired with a phone.I can not see anything in the advertisement specifying owning a phone is necessary to use the watch, or I would not have made this purchase.The puck is very light and ugly. It is so light that the kinks in the USB cable lift it of the desk. It wont stay put without blue-tack.I take my watch off at night, and want to put it at my night stand. The charger is a bright white plastic that will appear as a blemish on any nightstand. Coupled with the blue tack to stop it moving, it's a major eyesore to the bedroom.",
            "The battery life is amazing. It really lasts for up to 2 weeks. Love the overall design of the watch and the heart rate monitoring technology is very accurate. Some great professional sports training modes and a precise GPS positioning system stand this watch out from its competitors. The watch seamlessly connects with my iPhone as well as my Huawei phone through the Huawei Health App. However, I'll strongly recommend to download the latest version of Health App from Huawei App Gallery. Sleep tracking is also a very strong feature and the recommendations to improve your sleep are amazingly accurate. It is truly my everyday life assistant. BUT, BUT, BUT, please be careful when you're purchasing this product. Please make sure that you purchase from Amazon AU store only because they are the ones with official Huawei AU stock. There are heaps of grey sellers such as Wireless Experts AU, The Around Australia, who do not sell Australian stock of Huawei products on Amazon and therefore, you'll not be entitled to official Huawei AU warranty should you end up buying products from these grey sellers.",
            "Going into purchase, I had already done quite a bit of research and the selling points were the fitness tracking features and great battery life. The GT2 42mm definitely does not disappoint in those departments.The fitness tracking is on par with what other more expensive fitness tracking bands offer and the battery life is GREAT, you can easily go 5 - 7 days without charging the watch once. On top of that, the watch itself is sleek and minimal looking, which I love.If the above is what you're looking for, then the GT2 42mm will fit the bill.If you're looking for a smart watch that integrates with other aspects of your life like messaging, controlling other apps, etc, then this may not be the watch for you.",
            "very good product, I could never go back to apple after having this watch, I charge every 10 days or so and I workout every day. would be nice to have more watch faces to choose from, but the ones they have are ok. Would also love to be able to since my music to it, but this is more of an apple issue as they don't allow it.",
            "This watch arrived yesterday, and like most items that are delivered, I was excited to try it out.  The watch itself is well made, and the screen is bright.  One of the main reasons I purchased the watch was to monitor heart rate, sleep, and Sp02.  Unfortunately all of these things appear to be linked to the optical heart rate monitor, which won't work through tattoo sleeves.  That leaves the only other benefits as the workout tracker, which seems to be slightly off from a GPS and timing point of view when compared to an iphone (watch was connected to my Samsung, with workouts in parallel), and the music storage option, which allows me to leave my phone at home when training.  I've only tried the workout tracker on cycling so far, so will give the running workout a go later on.  Unfortunately there is no auto pause option on the workouts, so will need to remember to hit the \"up\" button to pause at traffic lights.It did look like the pace wasn't being recorded on my bike ride this morning, but I'll know more after my run as I need the pace notifications during the run.Extremely disappointed so far. :-(",
            "Battery life is good, I got about 9 days with plenty of changing watch faces and trying new features in the first week. 14 days is theoretically possible but with the bare minimum of interaction so not really what you will get in practice. I am recharging each week because its easy to remember to charge every Sunday for example and I still have several days up my sleeve just in case. Some of the features seem to work well but I can't vouch for their accuracy (sleep states, stress levels) I don't think they are very accurate, more for fun.",
            "Amazing screen and battery life, took a while to figure out how notifications work but couldn't be happier, especially at the price got it for, don't even need my glasses to read the screen \ud83d\udc4d, edit, best watch ever, never realised how handy taking and making calls from the watch would be 10 stars\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",
            "Watch looks pretty good and rich. Battery life is approximately 10 to 12 days. Worst thing of this watch is the notifications are off automatically after few days and then to get it back you have to reset the watch also re install the app..I hate that.Overall feedback is not worth the price.",
            "The watch worked reasonably well with my 6 year old OPPO phone on Android 5.1.1.13 and so much better than the Samsung Watch.  Samsung health will not install on  Android 5.1.1.13 although the other Samsung watch software will.Data displayed on Huawei Health Application is not the same or as accurate as that recorded on the Watch.  For running, Heart Rate, Charts the breakdown of the run is incorrect showing most of the time in Fat Burning and Warm up where as the watch correctly show Extreme, Anaerobic & Aerobic time missing from the Health App.  Why even when fully synced this critical data is incorrect in the Health App?Will test with an updated version of the Health App.  Google Play for some reason are distributing an older version??Huawei support were very helpful and very fast to respond and offer assistance but have no solid solutions. Subsequent use has exposed further serious bugs and limitations widely reported but apparently unresolved by Huawei technical support.",
            "Other than the watch faces that you can download for this watch, I do not have any problems with it.The watch faces are region specific in that dates are mostly displayed as mm/dd. This cannot be altered. They also look infantile, a lot of them. They seem to have been designed by a bunch of special ed high schoolers.Currently, looking for a way to install custom faces on the watch without jeopardising my security/privacy.",
            "This is my second Huawei GT2 watch which I am generally very impressed by the build quality and amazing battery life. Unfortunately the GT2e had issues so I had to return it. It was only the watch I purchased from Amazon that had the glitches, the other one is still fine and consistently accurate. I still highly recommend this watch and the great service and consideration Amazon has given.",
            "The build quality of the watch is first class. I had an older Samsung watch and this one looks so much nicer. There are 2 straps included and you can swap out other ones easily. The display is gorgeous and there are lots of watch faces that you can add.The battery life is amazing! It also charges very quickly. This product is slightly limited but I like the fact that it is not as invasive as other smartwatches. I would highly recommend this watch.",
            "I've never owned a name brand smart watch , I had a cheap one and it would last 2 days on a charge , I've never tried to see how long this watch will run , I normally charge it after a week, but so far it does everything I want it to , tracks my day hikes very well , alerts me of all the usual messages, emails,calls etc, so i have no complaints :)",
            "Updated from the GT2 Sport version. The GT2 Pro is the ultimate in Luxury. There is nothing better. Nothing! This is the digital Rolex, only better!",
            "I love this watch, it's the fitness buddy I was needing, keeps me motivated & helps me track the important stuff at all times. Not sure how accurate the sensors are, but I'm confident they're at least 90% on the money with the data I'm given. Be very careful with the screen however, it took one rough wall to scratch half the screen beyond repair. For the money however this is one very impressive watch & the white looks very sporty.",
            "Sooo disappointed by this watch.The battery is not lasting long, the touchscreen is not working all the time and the workout tracker wasnt accurat at all. I did everything in the way how it was described but well I am really unhappy. I gave it a go still to see if it is getting more accurate after time. But no it did not change.",
            "Much nicer build and materials than I expected. Beautifully put together. I the main feature I had been looking forward to had been the phoneless music playing via Bluetooth earbuds. That works well but the other little touches really pleasantly surprised me.Oh also the Battery life is terrific. Still above 70% after a couple days of use.",
            "Got this watch as Christmas gift. Absolutely loved it. Easy connection with your phone, allows you to play music, answer or decline calls and keep track of your fitness. Very sleek design and not bulky at all which makes it easy to wear and looks fantastic. You can change the front page of your watch by downloading seperate screens from the my health app. There is although a little bit of a delay on some occassions which does not bug me much. Strongly recommend you buy.",
            "It's good for the price you pay 137 AUD. If it was more - forget about it! Bottom part made from plastic therefore the vibration is noisy and useless as you hear the rattle but won't fill it vibrate on your wrist :((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((("

Minimalist design with latest snapdragon 4100 at a budget friendly price. From step counting to O2 level monitoring this watch is packed with features. Silicon strap that comes with the watch is good quality. Even though the watch feels a bit bulky at 12.6mm, it is very comfortable to wear. I haven't tried all the workout modes but normal step counting, sleep tracking seems to work fine.Snap 4100 chip paired with 1gb ram makes the watch work without any issues. I haven't faced a single lag yet. Battery seems to last good with 24hr Heartrate and O2 level monitoring, fully charged last day and after 20 hrs of normal usage still got 40% left.Calls can be answered straight from the watch and the speaker is loud enough for an indoor environment. Mic quality is decent no one complained about my voice being distorted or too low.LCD display is one of the drawbacks of the watch but it is sharp and colours are good. Sunlight legibility is not an issue but the brightness needs to be increased manually since there is no ambient light sensor present. Double click on the top button increases the brigntess to maximinum for a small amount of time which helps under direct sunlight.Overall for the price this watch is very good. Considering the fact that Google will be releasing the wear OS 3.0 in early 2022, Ticwatch E3 will be one of the watches to get it.",
            "Design and Build:-impressive design , stylish frame, which makes the watch look amazing, has a good build and light weight but there\u2019s one flaw that it\u2019s design makes its screen extremely prominent to damage while use .Features and OS:- The google wear OS works very fine on this beautiful watch along with its connectivity features ( nfc, Bluetooth,wifi), first watch I have seen with Google pay at this price point, it makes payment convenient efficiently. Watch faces offered by Mobvoi are a big bonus\ud83d\ude0d.It has many workout modes, I have tried 4 of those and they worked out pretty accurate with your workout and health details. It has swim workout tracker that is a very extraordinary feature as it lets your track your activity and health details while swimming( so amazing \ud83e\udd2f ). It can even track your sleep \ud83d\ude34.Battery and charging:- The charging speed of this watch is impressive( it charges at an amazing speed). Battery life is good, lasts 2 days on normal mode but it drains very quick while tracking any workout or if you use it while connected to wifi.CONCLUSION:- an all rounder attractive looking smartwatch with an extremely affordable price tag. There are some minor flaws though, but they can be ignored by that extremely affordable and competitive price tag. Rest everything about this watch is beautiful.\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf",
            "Honestly a great all round budget smart watch, if you're worried about future proof of this watch, no need to. The snap dragon 4100 built into this watch is more than capable of scrolling through the apps and notifications super smoothly. Was very surprised of the performance. With Samsung and Google's collaboration this year, wear os (the operating system) is due to get a revamp which has already been confirmed for this watch, which I can't wait for. The battery life is OK... If you have a watch face that doesn't show too much you'll have more than a day of use. Style of this watch is one thing I was kinda disappointed about. The big bezzels are distracting to the eye as well... But if you're looking for a smart watch that does everything a $400 Samsung watch 4 does, and your on a budget? This is a pretty damn good option for the price.",
            "This definitely is the coolest smartwatch I\u2019ve owned so far.Looks - 5 stars - I\u2019ve always admired watches with a round dial against the square, rectangle ones.It was easy to set-up. Really cool watch faces available and can be changed with a single tap and is updated within seconds.Looking forward to set-up Google pay and use other features such as being able to respond to texts and taking calls from the watch.Very reasonably priced keeping in mind the features it offers in comparison to other brands. Will definitely recommend.",

I received constant updates for the delivery from both my Amazon app, and my Australia Post app. The watch itself is exactly as I expected, as it was replacing an Apple Watch 2. Setup was made slightly more complicated, because Apple force you to update your iPhone to the latest OS (15.1), which was problematic, and which I wasn't keen to do because of the problems that are currently being found on the OS!! Once setup, the watch display is so clear and easy to read, and I really like the 'Always On' function, which doesn't really drain the battery ....as I had expected.",

            "I have used this watch now for the last 4 months as a volunteer ES worker. It's been covered in dirt, submerged in stormwater, banged against the truck, etc. etc. Works perfectly, as rugged as advertised. Love that you can use it while wearing gloves, keep the face illuminated as long as needed, and only need to recharge it every few weeks. Former Fitbit users will notice the Connect app is not as fluent or flexible as Fitbit, particularly in terms of measuring sleep accuracy, however I'm actually enjoying the freedom of rating my sleep based on how I am feeling rather than worrying about the amount of deep sleep I got. Very happy with this watch and will stick with it! Other members of my crew have the same watch and also swear by it.",
            "Changed to this watch from the Apple Watch - it always felt a bit fragile, and when I'm out doing stuff I was worried it would break. The Instinct is solid and has been everywhere with me - camping, swimming in the open water, getting wood in and during farm work. I've tracked field hockey, tennis and running and it's been great. It's a big and relatively simple watch but does everything I need it to - heart rate tracking, GPS, compass, alerts, time (lulz), calendar etc. I chose the solar edition and it's been nice to get an extra charge here and there when I've been out. With the GPS running and full tracking going the battery life drops faster than normal, but the solar charge offsets that somewhat which is great. I've had this watch now for 4 or 5 weeks and I've charged it 4 times (only once to full charge too - the others have been top ups of 20 - 30%). It's been great. The app on the phone syncs nicely to the watch and has lots of great info extracted from the watch. The body battery has been a game changer - it's prompted a pretty serious review of some habits causing my sleep to be impacted. By using the watch's biometrics I'm feeling better and keeping an eye on things. It's kicks the crap out of the Apple Watch from a sleep management, and exercise perspective. Worth buying if these features are important to you.",
            "As this is my second Garmin Instinct watch I was looking forward to using it. That was until I found the battery on this watch last less than a day. My thinking is they didn't want to use 2 types of batterys between their solar version and standard Instinct watches and so just used one type. Though this would also mean their solar version won't last long with out time in the sun.",
            "Pros. Long lasting battery, fairly accurate, rugged watch that is good for outdoors activities, face is easy to read in most conditions, use it more than the Fenix 6x Pro now. Has all the necessary modes/functions for outdoor use, including skydiving,I have added glass screen and silicone case protectors.Cons. Not an issue for me: Cannot use with Connect IQ mobile app, has less functions than other Garmin watches, which have no use when outdoors.",
            "Solar recharging doesn't work correctly. Periodically stops working then I have to switch the watch off and then on to get it working again. Had it exposed fully to the sun but no data. In my view I should have saved the huge price difference and purchased the standard Instinct. Cant see the value in the Solar. Garmin support very slow to respond - still waiting to find out what is going to happen.",
            "Took it for hiking today for the first time and tried the hiking function, man it delivered as what it had promoted to be.. light watch, clear, easy to customised and provides near to accurate navigation. Linking up with GPS satellite is fast and the track back function is simply brilliant... A brilliant buy... Overall ratings:  A+",
            "Have not become familiar with all functions yet but the basic time , date and including heart rate monitor, charge indication and  charge execution are all very easy to work with.  The watch has been counting walking, swimming and  kayaking stokes  well to my anticipation  but  I have not checked in any detail for accuracy at this point. Definitely need to spend a little more time reading the manual to discover and practice more of the functionally of this watch. The menu logic is also quite intuitive to my surprise as an older user that struggles a bit with the myriad of newer devices placed in our path these days.",
            "Wow what a watch, it promises to do everything except wash the car. I didn't get to explore this as the ABC sensor compass was out 40 degrees. Down loaded the user manual and recalibrated it as on page 20 to see no improvement so back in the box it must go. Once bitten twice shy. Maybe a Casio.......",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0Repeated failures has made me return this watchI had got it updlgraded from the old inctict because the old ones battery was not holding charge ,the new solar one is just two months old and has already had issues with screen hanging and battery level showing inaccurate result",
            "If you don't care about altimeter, then forget this review, because everything about this watch is excellent. It's great looking and very functional. Awesome really. The main reason I purchased this watch is because live altimeter is especially important to me as a runner. Unfortunately, the altimeter sensor is located on the back of the watch. I sweat a lot and my sweat was interacting with the sensor, causing erroneous readings. If you don\u2019t sweat a lot, it would probably be ok. Instead I purchased a Fenix 5, which has the senor on the side\u2026..very accurate and I\u2019m delighted with that watch.",
            "This watch is best for who want a smart watch but also lead an active lifestyle. I do not need to worry about damaging the body or screen as the bezel is tough plastic resin and protects the screen from most impacts by design alone.Battery life is solid, as long as you turn off full time GPS and energy blood oxygen measuring as these are especially high battery use functions.Using the watch does take a few days to get used to but nothing to bad. Visibility of the screen is excellent throughout the day. Also customisable.Excellent watch for what it is. A bit pricey.",
            "so what drew me to this watch is that i want to start hiking and it has the 3 satellite connections and it can take you back to your starting point if you get lost!! (not yet tested,  i will need to learn some navigation skills 1st before i can tell if it's accurate)The instinct monitors my heart, stress and sleep which are 3 things important to me and of course daily step count. i could only find those 3 features in a fitbit and that was double the price of this watch!!  (apparently the apple version of sleep is no good so it was already discounted - apple again is more expensive). it also links up to my fitness pal. between the 2 i'm pretty sure everything is covered for health and wellness. however, if you're in group fitness like i am, i have had to add in each exercise manually via the app on my phone.this watch is rugged and made for being outdoors - so i'm not always worried about scratching it or getting it wet etc. the battery life is awesome!! over 2 weeks and still a bar left :DIt takes a while to navigate your way around the watch - but once you're used to it, then it's fine. I found the manual online.i have no regrets choosing this watch over my other choices. it suits me now and it's got the features i want for my future outdoor adventures so i will grow into this watch. The bonus is it didn't cost me the earth!! after all, if given a choice of spending $800 on a watch or $800 on a return trip to Asia, i'd pick the holiday every single time!!",
            "I've had other Garmin fitness trackers and they have worked well and have been waterproof for swimming which is a feature I need.  I upgraded recently to the Instinct and it's working without problems.  Since I do a reasonable amount of physical work I needed something a bit more rugged that can take a knock or two.  The Instinct has a very readable display, even underwater through goggles, and so far has very good battery life between charges.  I'm well pleased and the price was right also.",
            "It worked well on the first day. It counted my steps, it measured my heart rate, etc. Then on the second day, it turned into a potato. I woke up and the battery was dead. I recharged it and put it on. It had stopped counting my steps and was no longer picking up my pulse. I went to work and before lunch I was getting low-battery alerts, so I just turned it off. Came home, charged it again, factory reset, but it didn't help.I'm returning it, and frankly I'm a bit shaken as a loyal Garmin user (this was my 4th Garmin watch). I'm not even going to order another one right away.",
            "I researched alot of watches and just needs it to work as advertised. The watches battery life is amazing due to the solar power system. I have had the watch for 3 weeks and have not needed to charge via the cable. It's remains on 33 days remaining. I use it primarily as watch and step counter and ABC functions. The heart rate and alarms I don't really use so I have them switched off. I have had Gshock solar and Protrek solar watches for years and this is just as good and has more functionality.Love it and would easily recommend purchasing.",
            "May not be as fancy as my Galaxy smartwatch, but its tough, rugged and packs all the features needed for my daily and outdoor activities.  What more it has battery that last forever.  Had this for almost 3 weeks now amd charged it only once.  Worth the price especially at a big discount is a big plus.",
            "Bought purely because phone GPS wasn't accurate and occasionally stopped all together. This watch is very accurate with GPS and has made recording, pausing and uploading Strava sessions extremely easy. Heart rate monitor works well even with aggressive MTB riding. You can also turn off phone call and message functionality, I did as I only wanted time + GPS. Great battery life as well though you do notice that long rides with GPS do hit the battery hard but still plenty left in the tank.",
            "Still finding out all the features. Great watch with great features. However, in the absence of internet connections, the instructions included with the watch are very lean and could include a lot more info. A lot of time is wasted fiddling with buttons before getting the appropriate screen/settings. That said, it pairs nicely with my phone, something I've not had before and that I find very useful. Don't get me wrong - its a great product and I'm loving it.",
            "Great little watch, still learning all the features, have noticed that the accuracy seems only a little off when out doing activities but does refresh and update once back home. Would be great if it was more accurate out and about, my partner also has a different garmin watch and hers is very accurate out and about, other than this all seems great so far, good battery life, quick on recharge, and love the colour.",
            "I owned a basic step counter and wanted to upgrade to something more professional. After spending time looking around this was my choice and I dont regret it. Has all the features I need and more that I probably will not use. Have been using it for almost 2 weeks now and loving all the details it now allows me to track. Only complaint is that it is a little on the large side but otherwise I am very happy with this watch. Can recommend.",
            "Received this item and it doesn\u2019t turn on, does not charge, does not hold a charge, and does have have a display. No warranty information with package.  Ordering from third party was a obvious mistake I shouldn\u2019t have done. No quality control ! better  ordering from Garmin direct instead of this fake rubbish. Returned for a refund!!! Waste of my time",
            "THE BATTERY WORK OF THE WATCH IS TOO SHORTAFTER A LONG CHARGING JUST CAN USE IT 1 MINUTE...NO CHARGING...I WAS THINKING TO BUY THE SOLAR ONE...BUT NOW I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS WORTHYI HOPE THERE IS OPTION OF WARRANTY",
            "This is a great outdoor activity tracker. The mobile app is a little hard to use at first, but it's fine once you learn where everything is. This thing has an amazing battery life... If you don't use the GPS functions you only need to charge it once once every 10 days or so.",
            "So much better than the Samsung I had before. It alerts me to calls and messages, tracks my steps and the best part is I have had it for around four weeks now and only had to charge it once!",
            "This watch does all the things advertised.I'm bit spoiled by my previous smartwatch (Pebble), but I'm overall happy with it.Things that could be improved are:1, Simpler navigation2, Faster access to music controls3, Could be more customizable",
            "Top product. Excellent battery life (days). Software is the best I have used, and stable. Really good info and links to other software.",
            "I purchased this Garmin for my son who is a landscaper and works outdoors.  He is on the go most of the day every day whether it is working at his job or on his fitness.  He loves the Garmin Instinct Rugged watch.  It monitors his heart rate and keeps him in tune with his body.",
            "Perfect for what you need and I would buy again! From running in the Alps to Marathons and tactical exercises in the Military! Perfect!! Follow my Instagram to see pictures and videos of this all around the world!!@Jas_maximusCheers!!",

            "firstly i was not happy with the dial size on my hand but apart from that this watch is amazing... i mostly use it whatever sports i am doing or in gym but helps a lott. accurate",
            "After the initial hiccup with the onboard software version causing button problems, it has settled into a very dependable and useful health and fitness tool.",

        "review_list": [
            "While I do wish the band was slightly wider, so the text could be larger and easier to read, Im happy with it in just about every aspect. It works well, and Im pleased with the data it provides. The app useful and informative, but it is annoying to have to keep going between \"device\" and \"health\" tabs to do different things, which I suppose is how they organise it to cater to people with multiple devices. It just makes it more troublesome for those like me with only one. The reason I give tyhe product and overall 2, however, is because os the unforgivable app permissions. The app outright cannot be used without putting in my personal phone number, so that it can confirm who I am. Why the F does it need to know who I am? And given this is Huawei we are talking about, you'd think they'd know better than to go sticking their nose into people's privacy. The app also continually asks for permissions that it doesnt need, and it keeps asking and asking. I will never give in; I just say no every time. So, great device, if you dont mind the mindset of the the company, which wants to know ALL about you.",
            "This smart watch is great. You can change your watch faces by downloading via the Huawei health app. There are 96 workout modes to choose from. You can check your pulse, amount and quality of sleep, oxygen levels, stress levels. It has a cute reminder cartoon which tells you to get up and move around. It displays the weather. You can read text messages sent to your mobile, but can't reply using the watch. It also has the ability to let you reject calls (but not answer them). It has a stopwatch, timer and alarm. I am very happy with the quality of this watch.",
            "Not the best but great. I find the size being the down side because it's designed to fit both male and female. It really doesn't and especially you're a more slim or petit female it really wouldn't fit nicely. The watch face part and where it bends over your wrist is too long. So if you have thick bone or thick wrist it's great. Otherwise it's not.",
            "While it's pretty and comfortable... it doesn't work accurately at all. Measured against medical equipment often, the data was wildly off. According to the watch I was at 81% oxygen in my blood... official testing at the time said 99%, that quite the difference. Watch said my heartrate was 105, medical testing said 62... another huge difference. Said I was asleep an hour before I even tried to get to sleep. There is no point to buying this for health monitoring. It's just a pretty watch.",
            "Huawei has done justice to this product. it does what it say from monitoring heart rate, sleep and distance etc.the most what I liked its the battery life. it gave me 6 days on a full charge. I have Samsung Gear 2 which only lasted a day, with notification may be half day. I got 6 days with notifications which is very impressive.I would have given a 5 star rating but the charging of the band is not as per the description, it has a separate charger, I would have like if it was like Band 4 - USB type as it would be easier to charge if battery goes low at work.apart from that I would recommend this band any time. its the best on the market at very good price.",
            "I've been using it for about 1 week and overall it was a good buy for an entry-level health band.  It does lack some of the key features of the more expensive alternatives.Pros:-Has 24hr heart rate monitor (simpler version) and customisable-SPO2 measurement-A reasonably detailed sleep tracker-Integrated GPS-Aesthetically pleasingCons:-The heart monitor doesn't have heart rate variability (HRV) which is used to measure stress levels. If that's important to you, don't buy it.-Integrated GPS uses a lot of battery. If you have 24/7 Heart rate turned on and GPS and notifications, the battery will last 3 days max.-requires wifi for the app to analyse the data which is strange? (not sure if this is standard)-There may be a privacy issue given it requires wifi when it probably shouldn't.So if you just want to try a health band this is a good buy but if you are serious about detailed measurement to improve your health or monitor your condition, this is not the right item for you, go for a 200+ dollar smartwatch.",
            "I have waited 1 month before reviewing this product,For the price this is an amazing product, i get around 10-12 days battery life with this watch (amazing).The USB charging is a great idea, no need to buy anything additional.I have a large hand, so it looks nice and small for my hand. However those with a small hand may find it slightly bulky.Great Buy 100% Recommend",
            "I have another Huawei watch (man size) which I received when I bought my phone.  Love that one but it is big and a bit heavy.  This one is so much lighter and with more features and is so much more comfortable for sleep tracking.  Can hardly wait until I can buy a Velcro band for it but the silicon one is quite comfortable for the moment.",
            "HUAWEI Band 4 Pro, Built-in GPS, Workout Guidance - Pink GoldI deliberated for a while about getting a fitness tracker for running. I wanted to be able to see my route with a reliable GPS, heart rate monitor and sleep analysis. It was very easy to set up following the instructions. There is a detailed manual under the help menu on the app. I was very impressed with the GPS. Selected outdoor run and it locked onto me in 3 seconds and then mapped the route perfectly. Great post run analytics with graphs of heart rate, pace and cadence that overlay each other as an option. Tried the option for outdoor walk for mowing the lawn but this didn't work so well (the map was out a bit) but I didn't really expect it to. Some options are listed on the app but not part of the device (e.g., climbing of stairs, stress). The sleep measure is perhaps a little inaccurate saying I'm dreaming when I'm actually still getting back to sleep. The app gives handy tips though for improving sleep quality. Lastly, the look of it is really stylish. I have a narrow wrist and was worried it would look bulky but it has heaps of holes in the band so fits perfectly and I've had lots of comments on how good it looks.",
            "I was looking for a watch with some basic functions of my exercise needs. I did quite a few researches on Fitbit, Garmin and then finally selected this one. This watch covers most of the functions that other types of watch got: heart rate, oxygen rate, types of workout and even message review function.  i have an iphone, and i can still receiving phone calls from this watch and decline the phone call. Will try the GPS function for the outdoor running. but definitely, this watch is very recommended to buy.",
            "I got my Huawei Band Pro 4 exactly one week ago. During this week, I was trying a little bit of everything. It has a nice design, it\u2019s easy to navigate, the app also has no secrets, the display is also good, GPS track also worked very well, and the sleep monitoring is very interesting with good suggestions to improve the quality of sleep.However, I am disappointed about the battery, which I had to charge FOUR TIMES in one week. I understand that using some tools would require a bit more of my battery, but I used my GPS only once in a 3 hours bike ride, I turned of notifications ao notifications, checked oxygen levels only twice and other than that I used it only to check the hours. I would understand if I had to charge it twice during this week because of the 3 hours activity with GPS, but no 4 times. That\u2019s too much.Another thing that I didn\u2019t like, but no really relevant, is that I have only 3 options for the background of its screen.",
            "Love the features and different workout features available in this band and the price is really good. Very sleak, stylish and a true work-out companion. Seamless connectivity with both iOs and Android. However, please download the latest version of Huawei Health App from Huawei App Gallery.",
            "The phone interface is easy to use and efficient. It connects through bluetooth and doesn't require the internet to transfer data. The many free watch faces are attractive and there is something to suit everyone. I have mine synced to my Huawei phone and all notifications come through the watch. It's so good for the price!",
            "I just got it and so disappointing with the battery life. I  am just using this watch because my skin seems to be ok with it. I am yet to experience skin burns like my previous watch. This seems to be the only advantage.For a watch cost almost 100$, i never expected the battery life to be such a disaster.",
            "I use it a few times a week and the battery lasts and lasts. I only count steps, distance walked and heart beats per minute but I am sure I will start to use the few other features it has. You do need a magnifying glass to read it whilst out and about. The app on my phone works OK.",
            "Never thought of using huawei but give it a try, you wont regret it.Battery last 7days with 10% leftScreen is great, quality band, tracking is spot on, sleep track does what its meant too.I've compared them all and the only comes close is fitbit.",
            "Great watch! Was a little tricky figuring out the apps and setting it up, but eventually got there. Was a great gift for my sister. The band 4 wasn't listed on the device list of bluetooth when setting up, I'm still not sure why it eventually worked, but it did! An hour later :)",
            "Would not fit band to small! Mighty ape your supplier will not accept return as package has been opened . Not impressed!",
            "I think this is a great prodcut but be aware, if you register the app with a non-chinese mobile phone, you won't get the watch face store",
            "Nothing to dislike, works as well as could be wished and the SpO2 feature is a pleasant bonus. The battery life is surprisingly good, 5 or 6 days, even with the Heart rate monitor running all day.",
            "The tracker was great but I had an allergic reaction to the band. I only wore it for 2 days but didn't seem as accurate as my Charge 2.",

            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0The Umidigi Uwatch3 GPS Smart Watch with Built-in GPS is delightful, lightweight, comfortable, easy to wear and meets all of your fitness and health tracking needs.The striking, attractive rubber wristband with the red stripe makes the watch so much easier to see - and more importantly - to easily find. The rubber itself is very comfortable, durable and so lightweight that you almost forget that the watch is even on your wrist.The watch face is bright, very clear and easy to see even in outdoor light.On the reverse is the heart rate and pulse sensor as well as a really well designed magnetic charge connection point.The USB charge cable easily snaps on and off. That's a really nice feature because there is no fiddling around with micro usb sockets. There's no breakable ends. It just pops on and off so quickly and easily.The watch face features a very clear charge indicator so as soon as it it's about 99% or 100% you can just easily disconnect and away you go.Navigation around the watch face is super simple. It's just a matter of flicking with your finger from left to right and up and down to access the various parts of the menu that interest you.In the sports section you can monitor outdoor and indoor runs, outdoor walks, outdoor and indoor cycling, cricket, indoor and open water swimming as well. These activities can be tracked by the GPS with the data uploaded to the Very Fit Pro App that you can download to your Apple or Android device.The watch face also allows you to access the heart rate sensor, the relaxation sensor, alarm, music controller, timer, weather, sports record and settings. There really is something for everyone.Of course many of the above functions can be synchronised with your Android device via the Very Fit Pro app.The app also allows you to customise the look of the front screen of the watch and you can choose from a number of different designs according to your preferences.One of the most impressive features of the watch is the battery life.I ran this watch for about 10 days without any charge just to see how long the battery would last.On day 10 the battery still had about 45% left.The watch instruction manual says it has about a 5 to 7 Day battery life - but obviously that would be with maximum intensity use. In reality, I found that with just normal, day-to-day use - you can get at least 10 days with 45% still in the tank.In such situations the battery would probably last for up to 14 to 20 days - which is quite impressive.So if you forget your charge cable and you're away from home for a week or two - just relax - it's not a problem.A nice feature of the watch is the Very Fit Pro app that you allows you to monitor all of your activities.You can monitor your sleep and set up call alerts, a sedentary alert alarm alert and SMS alert. There's also settings for music controls and heart rate detection.It's quite comprehensive.It also presents graphs to monitor your activities from day to day and your sleep patterns.There's average statistics for each day across a range of activities. So all in all these are very nice features to sync with the watch, and use from day to day to monitor your fitness and health levels.The Umidigi UWatch 3 GPS is a very well priced solution for anyone who wants to monitor their health and activity levels and get a clear picture of their overall performance.It's comfortable, lightweight and looks like many of the much more expensive smart watches on the market.For the price and performance you'll be quite satisfied with what Umidigi has delivered in this delightful, day-to-day, high tech health and fitness companion.",
            "Ordered this for my son as a Christmas Gift. It did not charge, it did not respond to any stimulus. Disappointment.Returned and bought a new one. Worked for maybe two weeks after that refused to charge, went blank and did not respond to any stimulus. (and yes I had few electronic gadgets in my life and know \"turn it on and off\" and all that stuff etc.)Jeff is selling this stuff for $50 and probably paying around $2 back to producer in P.R.C. (aka China). No wonder it does not work.",
            "I got this because I switched to a Samsung phone AFTER I already had an Apple watch so needed something to notify me when I got calls. This lets me know when a call is coming through when the phone is on silent and I can also read texts.  I also use the timer and it's handy to have the 'find my phone' option too. Use the app to check on sleep patterns and heart rate. Seems to be accurate enough. For the price I paid and for the functions I use it for, I'm pretty happy with this watch. The battery is good too. No need to charge it for days and I wear it 24/7.",
            "Got this watch a couple of weeks ago. It does exactly what is described. Good watch for the price paid. Would've been helpful if it had more features such as showing the weather, BP monitor, more watch faces etc, but I guess it's too much to ask for this budget. Had a few issues initially with the watch face waking up with the flick of my wrist, but it was set right once I turned the setting on and off on the app. Great activity/sleep tracking. Overall I'm happy with the purchase!",
            "I bought the pink, within 9days all my strap was blue off my jeans, might add old jeans washed for 3 years, and a navy blue jumper been washed loads no matter how you try to clean it it will not come off, consequently the watch looks scruffy......doesn\u2019t do a lot you get what you pay for worth $10 would not recommend at all DO NOT BUY PINK....VERY DISSATISFIED",
            "I have been using this watch for little more than 2 weeks now and love everything about this watch. The best thing about this watch is its battery life. It has been more than 2 weeks from first charge and it is still going compare this to my last watch needing recharging almost everyday really impressive.Also this watch in rose gold(pink) looks amazingly beautiful, and it has been mistaken for big brand expensive watch by my friends and co workers. Ask them how much they think I paid for it and the figure most of them come up is 9-10 times higher what I paid for it.The display is great too. Responsive to gesture movements ,great colours, simple user interface connects easily to the app, step counter is accurate enough for measuring distance done during run for a watch without GPS. Good range of workout tracking although they could added a few more for people who are doing lot more kind of workouts but for me who mainly do running it is great.I think it is very good watch for the price you pay for it. I would say best value for money I have used till now.",
            "I got this because I wanted to track how many calories I burned during a run/workout/walk etc without buying an Apple Watch. It\u2019s great for that! Can also see FB messages, incoming calls or skip songs which is an added bonus. Can\u2019t text or reply which I don\u2019t mind. Downside is the steps and calories burnt don\u2019t sync with the health app on your iPhone and the band (I got pink stains easily, mine is all black from jumpers rubbing on the rubber etc)",
            "I have been wearing it for 2 weeks. I must say this watch is very good for its price. Long lasting battery, looks fancy, comfortable, very light, connects well with my umidigi power 3, reads heart beat, counts steps. The only downside I would say is lift wrist sense is slow and sometimes it doesn't work at all and I have to press button on the side to wake it up",
            "Really fast shipping. Long battery life. Working as it promised. However, I went to beach with toddler daughter and right after watch dip in about 20cm, charging light was on and stopped working... In the description, it says it is light water proof. It might be I got a bad unit. The return was smooth and straight away. I was ready to send them but my car broken into so it got stolen.... :( (To owner, if you gracious send one, I would be grateful. :)) If this is your first smart watch, give it a try. it is a product worth try.",
            "I use it to count my daily steps , and have had a few different fitness trackers, I find if I count 300 steps in my head, then look at my watch its spot on, and that is the important part for me, I want it to tell me the steps I have done , not more not less ..........so that's very good..........the screens could be better with more display of date time amount of steps and calories on the front screen , but I knew what i was getting, so happy"

            "I've read many reviews before buying this smart watch to use primarily as a HRM for fitness tracking. I want to like it  but unfortunately I'm returning it after a few days of using because it's simply not accurate. When resting with my ave HR of 65bpm, the error is tolerable (compared it to my iphone HR monitor and with my Garmin monitor). The problem is when I start to perform basis exercises (like push-up), my Garmin monitor would show my HR peaking over 120bpm while the watch would not go over 95bpm. As another example (see attached photos), I've tested it on a bicycle ride for an hour. My Garmin would have an ave HR of 134bpm with a max of 154 while the watch would be 86 and 125 respectively. I know from my experience that the error is with the watch.What I also did not like about this watch is the sleep monitor function. It appears that this function only works automatically b/n 8:00pm and 10:00am and that it cannot be turned on or off manually. This is not good if one sleep outside this period or if one need to charge your watch during this period.Overall, I'm disappointed that it does not work as advertised. I didn't expect it be accurate as my Garmin but the margin of error is not acceptable.",
            "I bought this watch a while ago, and I really like it. It values for money. It got many functions and all works very well. The most functions I like are the blood pressure monitor, sleep status monitor, distance and step calculator, and stop watch. I don't have good sleep during night, and I want to monitor how bad of my sleep during night and take some treatment. This function on this watch works so well, it tells me how long I stay in bed for sleep, how long my light sleep is, and how long my deep sleep is, which are exactly what I need and I want to improve. The blood pressure monitor works well as well. The step calculator is extremely important for me, previously I use phone to monitor but I don't carry my phone all the time. This watch monitor my calories burn so well and encourages me to do more exercise as I can set up a goal and if I haven't reached to my goal, I need to do more activity. The stopwatch is a good one, as I don't need to hold it, it's my watch. It totally replaced my normal watch and it works so well. I can see time during the night or dark, I can set up the night model so it wouldn't be too bright. I can also use it as a torch during the night if I need to get up and move. I don't need to worry I lost my watch somewhere as it's so cheap and it's so comfortable, I don't want to take it off. I also like the weather function. It got so many functions, more than I expected. I always want to buy a smart watch, and this is exactly what I want. The battery last so long, I don't need to worry about it. It shows on the watch, when the battery is low, I can see it and I know when I should recharge it. It's not like the normal watch, we don't know when we need to change the battery. It is like a mini phone, it contains so many functions, control the music, control the call, take a photo, control the camera, see a message, a phone call, etc. All in all, I really love it and I wear it everyday. Plus it's so easy to set up, just scan the QR code in the manual and download an app through the phone, the watch can be fully functional. So cool! I will recommend it to all my friends, and I am really excited to wear it everyday!",
            "I thought I\u2019d take a punt on this given the price.  It worked well. For a few days.In the period it did work (4th-10th June 2021):PROS:Cost.It charged quickly.The strap is of good length so suitable for bigger wrists as well as skinny ones.CONS:The screen flickers at night which wakes me up. And if it\u2019s on charge rather than in my wrist the green charger light also flickers through the night, also waking me up.  In fairness I\u2019m a light sleeper.Lifespan is terrible. Not even a week \ud83d\ude1eI don\u2019t regret giving it a go.  My Apple Watch lasted 6 years but the battery didn\u2019t last the day - I\u2019m an active person \ud83d\ude02 I didn\u2019t like the Fitbit so thought I\u2019d try the cheapie to see how that worked.Lesson learned.  I\u2019m just glad its died within the return period. I can send it back and just get a refund.Thanks Hero Bit II. we tried.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0Would I recommend this to a friend who doesn't want an expensive or brand watch? 100%.In fact I also recommended it to friends who do have money and the ability to buy brand ones.Battery life is amazing.Easy to use and to link with the phone.It's pretty and quite tough as it went through the rough hands of my daughter who is 1.I like it. I enjoy it.100% recommended.",
            "Pro's-1.The soft band. Can be worn continuously and you don't feel it2. The battery life over 10 days with blue tooth and over 13 days without bluetooth3. The Price4. The BP, Heart rate and O2 as stand alone functionsCons1. The excess packaging for a small watch2. The big bezel on the small screen3. Heart rate is accurate within 5%. BP variation is over 20%.4. Steps are way out of sync and the sleep data a total mystery.5. It's a fun toy and worth it for the price.",
            "Smart watch with all the handy features of tracking your vital signs. It is really great for someone like me who works sitting down, as it reminds me to take a walk tracking down my steps. So much great features and services at low price, total worth it. I would highly recommend this for daily basis. I liked the options of the wallpaper it has, there some really cool lots. Still exploring this pretty thing and loving it even more.",
            "The heart rate is not always accurate, but this is true of a lot of the smart watches. Battery seems to last well and I\u2019m able to track distance walked and time. BP seems accurate. Charger is good - previous watch required me to take off part of watch band and insert into USB port. Soon stopped charging. All up, so far happy with this one but noted a lot of negative reviews which were not reflected in the rating shown on the selling page.",
            "I can\u2019t believe how great This watch is. It is so light weight I don\u2019t even realise I have it on. Easy to read screen. Very Very motivating to see how many kilometres you have walked in a day and calories used. There are so many more functions, sleep tracking even a mobile app. The the battery lasts for days and days just totally amazing. I\u2019m loving it.",
            "Heartrate and Blood Pressure only read for a day, now nothing works. I've tried resetting it multiple times but it won't measure anything.No instructions on how to get it properly working or how to hard reset if it's not working.From the other reviews, I thought it would be a great purchase, but I'm disappointed in this.If it's faulty, I'd like to replace it, to see if that changes anything.",
            "excellent watch.  bought this mainly for the BP reading/monitoring as most expensive smartwatches do not have this feature.  Is it the most accurate, unsure, I don't think these types of devices can be absolutely 100% but all readers that matter to me are fairly accurate and fit for my purpose",
            "What a great little watch its easy to understand and helpful to measure especially with heart probs, blood pressure and sleeping issues. Fantastic value hope it keeps working!",
            "Pros:This watch is pretty good in this priceGood screen resolutionMany watch face to choose fromSmooth to runConsI don\u2019t know how accurate is it\u2019s Blood pressure and heart rate monitorDoesn\u2019t detect step count accuratelySome features not compatible with IPhone such as camera click and weather",
            "Very difficult to set up watch. Monitors inaccurate eg. blood pressures shows reading far lower than reading on medical BP machine. I may have not set up the watch correctly but the photographs of watch do not match reality.",
            "A watch that you cannot set to the right time.  The screen turns off before you can even read what it displays and there is no way to adjust the screen timeout.  App seems like some kind of data harvesting scam.",

            "I like the watch for what it is, I Just Can't stand wearing watches used it for 1 day hanging up now.",
            "Great little watch, when it works. Have had a few issues where it stops reading steps. Try shutdown and restart and still not working. Only solution is reset, but this also resets your watch settings and steps for the day, so you lose your progress.",
            "Bought this on a whim after seeing it on sale, I am not disappointed at all! Monitors my blood pressure and heartbeat accurately and looks pretty stylish as well. The app also works great on my phone and I can track everything on it. Irs a bargain for the price of $40.",
            "Only $40 to get a SmartWatch can cover daily use and work perfectly. It's awesome that I can use the watch to control the music play/stop during exercise. I don't need to watch the phone when I was running. like it! The quality is also good, comfortable for the wrist.",
            "Hi guys, great wee watch with plenty of extras. I initially got it just for a stop watch and to check my steps. It has loads more to offer!! Battery life is fantastic and syncs wonderfully with your phone. Impressive but and really happy, great looking also\ud83d\ude01",

This in turn has stopped any type of access to my Fitness Watch, with this happening, I will be RETURNING my device.",
            "The watch indicated the wrong Blood pressure. My Doctor checked the blood pressure and the watch indicated a completely different diastolic and systolic. The heart rate indicated was wrong. I could not sleep from 1:30 am to 4:00 am. But the watch indicated that I slept 7 hours.I compared my pedometer and the telephone against the watch and found the walking - number of steps were wrong. Differences were intolerable.I am very disappointed with the watch.",
            "I only worn this thrice.The first time, I went for a walk and the bpm remained 81 but I thought it was just a glitch.Then the second time I did a skipping rope for three minutes just to check if it rises, still the bpm remained 81.A week later, bpm is still 81.I am returning this product.",
            "Value for money...impressive functions with this price tag",
            "This is a fantastic smart fitness watch from Popglory for the price of $40, period.I am generally not a smart watch person, and have been reluctant to jump on the Apple Watch boat for $1000; having said that, I have always wanted to try the fitness bands/watches to monitor my exercises and most importantly my sleep cycles. I found this Popglory watch on Amazon, and I convinced myself to gave it a try, it was only $40 anyway, what more could I lose? But the results completely surprised me, in a good way.I was initially quite sceptical about this watch's advertised functions, as it was only a very short while ago since Apple released their new Series 6 Apple Watch that had the blood pressure monitoring function; it was just unreal to me that a  $40 cheap 'knock-off' can have the same function. But it did!Over the past 5 days of using this watch, I have actively and regularly checked my blood pressure and heart rates, against the clinical blood pressure monitor we had in the lab, and surprisingly, this Popglory produced some reasonable results (around 10% inaccuracy - which was good enough for all this type of devices). This is really a good feature to have.Another function that I was keen was the sleep cycle monitor, which appears to be quite accurate so far; and I quite enjoy wearing it overnight. It is a very comfortable watch on my wrist, not too tight and very light & soft on your wrist too. With that said, I would not use it to replace my daily watch (an actual watch), I treat this watch more or less like a fitness monitor, and it does a much better job for the price that I paid for.Considering all the above, if you want a replacement watch for your fancy $1000 Apple Watch, this Popglory watch is not for you. However, if you want a simply and functional smart fitness watch, then, this is a perfect fit for you. It is so cheap at $40 that I honestly think no one will ever go wrong with it.",
            "It is easy to use with my phone .  I can track of my health easily such as blood oxygen , steps , blood pressure sleeping hours and quality . I really satisfied my one. You can choose many different screen wall which feature is so cool , if you check watch there are 3 options , but app provides nearly endless options.You can also personalize your screen with a personal photo, which feature is amazing .Secondly , I have very sensitive skin , so I was worried about it , but nothing has happened so far .I use my watch 7/24 , there is no allergic reaction at all.The strap is long enough for my husband as well .After using my watch long enough I can say battery life is so satisfying, and magnetic charger is easy to use.Overall , I am so happy with my smart watch.",
            "My previous Samsung watch was getting worn out, so I switched to this one. I usually go for something more expensive, but I've been impressed with this because it performs virtually all of the same duties at a lower cost.The watch was simple to set up, and the software runs smoothly on my Android phone. I was able to personalise the step goal, and the app displays my heart rate and sleep history. When I personally checked the heart rate feature, it was correct. It charges quickly and barely uses any energy during the day, which is a significant improvement over my previous model.I'm normally supposed to get a second, smaller band because the main one never fits into my wrist but it fits nicely on the little buckles. I still have some features like setting up some app notifications so it doesn't ring throughout the day. I want additional watch faces, but for now, he is working for me with all of the statistics on the screen. All in all, the quality and features considering the pricing are extremely impressive.",
            "I am in love with this smart watch. It looks and feels like a high end watch while keeping the price point affordable. It\u2019s been 5 days and I haven\u2019t charged it once and yet it shows I have only reached 50% and this includes a lot of playing around with the settings and functionalities.It connects seamlessly with my smart phone and while playing with the app, I came across tons of watch faces / backgrounds. It even allows me to customize using my own photos.My skin is usually very sensitive to watch straps but this one has a very soft belt and the watch itself is very light weight. I barely feel it on my hand which adds to the comfort.",
            "I love this smartwatch so much. It really motivates me to get in all of my steps for the day & tracks my workouts. I'm a beginner at the gym, so having this record my activity levels is super helpful.The battery life for this is amazing too, it lasts for over a day.It also has super useful features like \"find phone\". For someone like me who always loses my phone in my own house, I've used it so many times already & I've only had it for about 2-3 weeks. You can also view your text messages on it & customise it all with the phone app.I highly recommend this!! It's absolutely fantastic value for money!",
            "Bought this for tracking my daily activities and it offers much more than I thought! It can read the blood pressure, blood oxygen, heart rate and tracking the fitness activity. Mobile app works great too, you can have more watch face when you use the mobile app.",
            "I find this very light and easy, as compare to other expensive and heavy branded smart watches. Rubber band makes the difference, I like it. Although the information regarding exercise and other stuff are not really accurate, but common what can you expect in that price. It does worth it. I normally use it for notification and time. Long lasting battery as well, for me it last for minimum 4-5 days wearing continuously.",
            "Heart Rate and Steps are accurate. Temperature, Sleep and SpO2 measurements are also good. However, BP measurement is not accurate. Battery life is also good, it\u2019s about 2 to 3 days. It is also connected with both ios and Android mobile. I used it in both mobiles and working good in Android. Overall satisfied with this features.",
            "The watch came in a really nice package. The watch is everything you expect from a smart watch it has all the functions and features you get from a expensive watch. The battery life is good for everyday use. I bought one for me initially and this one was for my brother. He loves it so much.",
            "Great smart watch for a budget. Has all the basic functions, easy to connect to phone by just downloading the app and adding details. Great for a light exerciserto keep track of the workout"

            "Certainly all the features for the price. Gives me more than just the basics, includes respiration, body battery, stress, heart rate and your regular work out stats. Just love the feature to put your own pics on the face!",
            "Happy with product but concerned battery is only lasting a day. It is supposed to last longer so considering contacting Amazon to see if it can be rectified",
            "I bought this for my wife and she absolutely adores it. It does exactly what she wants it to do and is easy to use",
            "It suited my wifes desires perfectly",
            "Loved Loved It",
            "I looked into these watches because I didn\u2019t want to have my phone on me at work, but within all the back and forth trying to work out the best one, I got confused and forgot to look at whether this was cellular or not. Oh well. I don\u2019t use the music side just now and I get a solid 5-6 days of battery life. I find it hilarious when it tells me to \u2018breathe because I have a lot of stress\u2019 because it\u2019s always right. It\u2019s a bit chunkier than what I was use to, so I tend to bump it and catch it on stuff but I like it, a lot.",
            "Ich schlie\u00dfe mich hier den anderen negativen Bewertungen an die leider nichts Positives von der Uhr berichten k\u00f6nnen.Der Akkuverbrauch ist die reinste Katastrophe! Ich frage mich ob bei Garmin niemand die Uhr selbst testet und diesen Fehler bemerkt?Was wurde aus der tollen Qualit\u00e4tssicherung aus dem Hause Garmin!?Ich habe keine Lust Betatester f\u00fcr Garmin zu spielen, darum geht die Uhr sofort wieder retour.",
            "I bought this watch for my partner and I did a lot of research first on what I thought the right watch for her was.I wanted a watch that was exercise focussed, not ridiculously large and waterproof (not just water resistant).And this does tick all those boxes. I have a different smart watch and this one beats it on all of the above criteria. But in my opinion this is still not a better watch and it all comes down to the screen.Why they put such a poor screen in this watch I have no idea. The resolution is poor, the viewing angle is tiny and the colour is awful. It\u2019s like a screen from a 1995 laptop.And to make it worse they didn\u2019t even put the screen in straight on the one I bought. It\u2019s off from the 12 o\u2019clock position by about 2mm.The effect of the poor screen is in the apps. From a feature perspective the built-in apps are great. But they look awful. And the poor screen limits what developers can do with the display meaning the apps are very basic. I suspect this is also the reason why there are no decent 3rd party apps.Having said all that the apps for the accompanying device (phone or whatever) are pretty good - better than the ones for my watch.The watch looks pretty good though - screen aside - but when you get close to it you can see the build quality isn\u2019t on the Samsung/Apple level at all.If you\u2019re serious about exercise and health (and want a watch that isn\u2019t massive) this may be the watch for you. But if you want funky watch faces and cool apps it definitely isn\u2019t.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0This was my second garmin watch previously having Vivoactive music 3 which was much better than this one.This one broke after 2and a half months. It just stopped responding. I have sent the watch for repair and was told it will be returned to me within 3 weeks. Which didn\u2019t happen. I had to be contacting them on a few occasions and was told that I will receive a refund on the end which didn\u2019t happen either.  It\u2019s been nearly 5 weeks now and I have no watch and no refund. This is the first time ever I\u2019m not happy with the customer service at Amazon. They just keep saying to wait and that they have no update on the watch.This watch doesn\u2019t last long without charging it and the only credit I give to this watch is that it is a good looking watch.  Not worth the money and very bad experience for me.",
            "A mixed bag for me. As a fitness tracker, it works well. The GPS is very good and I liked that you can sync with Spotify if you're a premium user. However, there were too many deal-breakers, so I am returning the product.The sleep tracking is dire. I know the tech is hard on this one, but I experienced one very sleepless night whilst using this. It told me I got about 2h of REM sleep but during these times I was actually walking around making cups of tea, before sitting up to watch YouTube videos on my phone.The screen quality is also a bit rubbish. This is my main reason for returning the watch. I thought about exchanging it for the Venu, which is basically the same watch but with an AMOLED screen, however, for that price I could get an Apple Watch S3 and have change in my pocket!The yoga tracking was confusing. You seemed to have to tell it every move you did - no intuition.I can't comment on notifications as I turned them all off. I don't want texts, calls and emails on my wrist, thanks.I liked the running tracking on this, but it's a very expensive step/distance calculator! I didn't get on with the Garmin running plans (they seemed to be long term plans, whereas I wanted in-run motivation). I ended up taking my phone out on runs with me so I could have Nike Run Club coaching.So, with a heavy heart, I am returning this and giving in to the lure of Apple, which is a much better all-round watch for a not-dissimilar price.It looks kind of cute (though why don't they make a black and rose gold one? The white casing on the rose gold looks cheap and prevents making it into a more elegant watch, with a strap change). The smaller size did fit my tiny wrists quite well.",
            "Scheinbar habe ich Gl\u00fcck gehabt und eine Uhr erwischt,  die keine Probleme mit dem Akku hat.  Nach einem Tag Nutzung inclusive Bluetooth,  Aufzeichnung einer Wanderung und nat\u00fcrlich auch h\u00e4ufigem Blick auf die Uhr und dem Lesen von Nachrichten stand meine 4s abends bei 65 %.Da ich die Uhr eh fast t\u00e4glich kurz lade,  ist das f\u00fcr mich v\u00f6llig ausreichend.Ich finde nur die 2 Tasten an der rechten Seite nicht so praktisch und umst\u00e4ndlich in der Bedienung.  Ansonsten eine top Uhr.Und der Preis von 299 \u20ac hat mich schon z\u00f6gern lassen,  der ist ganz sch\u00f6n happig.",
            "This was my first fitness watch. After 6 months of trying to decide what to get (apple  or garmin) I bit the bullet and bought this. In some ways I love it. Nice looking watch and very handy for workouts - you can install your own ones quite easily and the GPS tracking is brilliant.But there are a few issues. The Bluetooth falls off a lot so you have to constantly log into the app to refresh it.The running app only tracks in miles and not kilometres even though I changed it over to KM.The Bluetooth earphones don\u2019t connect every time so you have to uninstall and reinstall which can be quite testing because it\u2019s not straight forward.Overall I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s worth the money it costs.",
            "This should be so good and when it works it is but I have only had it a month and in that time I have had to completely reconnect with my phone as it disconnects without warning. The music feature is also completely defunct unless I am prepared to pay over \u00a350 for a compatible pair of headphones. This is despite the headphones I have connecting fine initially but again, they just stopped working and now won\u2019t even connect to the watch.In terms of accuracy it seems fine and battery life is ok but the flakiness in the Bluetooth connectivity means I can\u2019t give a positive review of the watch....and I really wanted to like it.",
            "Crammed with applications and features.Did a lot of research into what would be the best sports watch whilst something that looked feminine as a gift for my wife and this won hands down. The Apple Watch looks too clunky whereas this looks like a traditional watch. The number of apps available is extensive and so you can tailor make your own training/fitness/diet/ lifestyle programs. The boffins at Garmin have done superb work  in creating a super long life battery for this watch, 4-5 Days?? UnbelievableDid I mention that it monitors your sleep patterns and advises you on you activity for the day ahead based on your sleep quality??It does all this and a lot lot more as well as connecting effortlessly to your phone for calls and messages. Forgot to say you can make payments with it as wellBrilliant watch!",
            "Only had a few wks but love that you can install music of my own and connect to my mugo Bluetooth headset with no problems and able to leave my phone at home and just go enjoy a run.All my runs have been recorded and I'm able to view on my phone or laptop.Battery lasts longer when you pick your choices of settings but using your music does use \ud83d\udd0b faster.  5-7 days without music.",
            "I am very disappointed with this watch,I'm an active person using my watch all the time,.I previously owned the Fenix 3 which had too many features that I didn't use, so I replaced it with this watch as a treat, I found out near enough straight away the battery drained so fast,  I turned the backlight off ( which wasnt practical) turned notifications off etc that helped But I charged one night 100% by the morning it was at 52% and continued to drain with no activity other than normal steps !!The worst part of this review is the watch is lovely, great features, they just need to get to grips with the battery life and it would be perfect.",
            "Bought this as a gift for my wife. She loved the design, color, music feature. But the batter isn't great. It doesn't last as long as others like Garming 245Music. I have a 245 music and i charge once in 3/4 days. but this one needs to be charged at least every 2 days. Even without using it much, it seems to be draining a lot quicker.",
            "Purchased this item as a gift for my wife as she'd been eyeing my Fenix 6 and she is over the moon with it and she is now ensuring she meets her daily goals because of this watch, a happy wife, a happy life!",
            "Die Uhr hat mich anfangs wirklich viel Frust und Nerven gekostet. Gef\u00fchlt hat nichts auf Anhieb funktioniert, der Akku war in k\u00fcrzester Zeit leer, ich war st\u00e4ndig nur am Resetten, Neustarten und in allen m\u00f6glichen Foren zu lesen. Selbst im Corona Lockdown habe ich eigentlich besseres zu tun. Was die Uhr gerettet hat, ist ihr tolles Aussehen, sie ist leicht und passt auch an mein wirklich schmales Handgelenk super gut. Und die Tatsache, dass sie f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich einfach alle Funktionen vereint die ich (glaube zu) ben\u00f6tige(n). Also habe ich ihr wirklich viele Chancen gegeben und bin im Nachhinein froh, sie nicht zur\u00fcck geschickt zu haben (obwohl ich bei der Einrichtung und dem anf\u00e4nglichen Testen mehrmals kurz davor war).Zum Akku, mit diversen Einstellungs-Anpassungen komme ich auf 5 Tage. Dabei ist die Helligkeit auf 30%, Benachrichtigungen / Bluetooth, sowie die HF-Messung angeschaltet und ich habe nur ein simples digitales Watchface. Alles andere (Widgets wie die Wasser-Erinnerung, PulsOx, PhysioTruUp, Display an mit Geste, etc.etc.) ist aus. Wenn ich die Uhr lade wenn sie aus ist, l\u00e4dt sie max. 99%, bzw. ben\u00f6tigt anscheinend 1% f\u00fcrs hochfahren.MIt Musik und GPS zieht die Uhr in 1,5h 30% Akku, nur GPS ben\u00f6tigt in derselben Zeit 10%. Synchronisierung mit meiner Spotify-Offline-Liste hat gut funktioniert, auch die Verbindung zu meinen BT Kopfh\u00f6rern.Die Koppelung mit Huawei-Ger\u00e4ten ist anscheinend generell eine Herausforderung, es gibt dazu im Garmin Forum einen entsprechenden Eintrag. Selbst all die Ratschl\u00e4ge dort befolgend hatte ich zun\u00e4chst Probleme. Die Verbindung brach regelm\u00e4\u00dfig ab und selbst mit bestehender Verbindung poppt bei mir auf dem P30 immer wieder eine Meldung hoch, dass keine Nachrichten \u00fcbermittelt werden k\u00f6nnen, und ich mein Handy neustarten soll. Mir hilft hier folgendes: in den Handy-Einstellungen nach \"Benachrichtigungszugriff\" suchen. Huawei-Start muss auf an stehen. Wenn das Problem ansonsten auftritt hilft es mir, hier den Zugriff f\u00fcr die Connect-App einfach zu deaktivieren und wieder zu aktivieren.Garmin Pay war eine der Funktionen die ich nur durch Reset der Uhr einrichten konnte (es wurde nach einem Update der Uhr gefragt, obwohl die aktuelle Version installiert war). Danach lief es aber sehr fl\u00fcssig. Ich reise viel und wollte mir sowieso ein Konto bei Revolut einrichten. Das geht super einfach, ist kostenlos, und ich lasse das jetzt einfach als Prepaid-Konto laufen (ist \u00fcber die Revolut-App so schnell aufgeladen, dass man das sogar notfalls auch noch beim Warten an der Kasse erledigen kann). Hinterlegung meiner digitalen Revolut-Kreditkarte zum Handy lief nach den anf\u00e4nglichen Schwierigkeiten problemlos. Das kontaktlose Bezahlen hat damit bisher \u00fcberall schnell & easy funktioniert.Ich hatte auch mit der Venu gelieb\u00e4ugelt, bin aber mit dem Display der Vivoactive 4s absolut zufrieden. Selbst bei 30% Helligkeit kann ich es sehr gut ablesen. Der Touchscreen funktioniert gut und die Men\u00fcf\u00fchrung einigerma\u00dfen sinnvoll. Man kennt sich schnell aus. Auch die Alarm/Timer Funktion finde ich super, benutze das gerne und bin froh, dass es so prominent verf\u00fcgbar ist.Wenn man selbst in der Lage ist, die Garmin-Foren-Eintr\u00e4ge zu lesen, braucht man den Support eigentlich nicht anzuschreiben, denn alles was sie tun, ist Links aus diesem Forum zu schicken. Mir haben neben den Rezensionen hier auch die im Playstore bei der Connect App geholfen.",
            "For the first 3 months worked like a dream, then it wouldn't charge. Contacted Garmin who tried a few options to sort the problem but nothing worked. Returned expecting a new replacement from Garmin but received a refurbished watch. OK so not the end of the world... at least it worked. A year later that has the same issues. Will not charge. It has the latest software updates but it's dead. Clearly Garmin know this watch has issues but of course won't admit it. Lovely design, but design doesn't measure your training",
            "Use this watch for mostly running and work outs at the moment and it has been great. It's very comfortable to wear and the monitors appear acccurate. The only thing that isn't the best is the sleep stuff, this appears less than accurate as I sat up one night reading as I couldn't sleep and that was on my watch as asleep! Also pulse Ox is very draining on the battery and its only lasted 2 days. Other than that the data is good and I'm pretty pleased with it so far.",
            "I love the way that this watch looks. Really stylish.The tracking in the watch is great, brilliant for working out and GPS tracking running, bike rides ect.The only down side to this watch is the Bluetooth connection to my phone. It often disconnects from my phone and struggles to reconnect again, therefore the battery life isn\u2019t as long as suggested. I often have to manually reconnect my watch to my phone.That is the only down side to the watch.",
            "Really pleased with this watch. Love the look of it seems pretty accurate recording my heartbeat but sometimes I think it\u2019s not quite right otherwise would\u2019ve got five stars. Took a while to get used to it as I had an Apple watch before but now I prefer it. Much prefer the look of it!",
            "This watch is great, it readings all my workouts and stores music too which means I don't have to carry my phone around. The GPS is also a great feature",
            "Love that it\u2019s stylish and covers a whole range of activitiesDoesn\u2019t \u2018recognise\u2019 when you undertake an activity for a sustained length of time as my old Fitbit didBattery runs out in far less than a week",
            "Sadly this watch has the same visual quality as a \u00a330 alternative. It is hard to see in light, and the text is even blurry.. The UI on the App is a nightmare to navigate compared to the FitBit app, in addition you go to download apps and watch faces, only to see them all be average reviewed then also have to pay on top of that for some.For this price point and a \"high quality range\" product very disappointed. Instantly returned.",
            "My wife absolutely loves this watch, it\u2019s very stylish keeps excellent track of her sporting activity\u2019s.Sleep tracking doesn\u2019t appear to be as good as her previous watch. Very competitive price",
            "Very happy with this watch,personalized work out,stores music,can reply to messages,counts steps,blood pressure overall very good",
            "The battery life is fantastic. So pleased with the features on this watch. I use this watch when running, waliking and at the gym",
            "It's great quality ! the best smartwach which I ever had. I using with Phone Samsung Galaxy s9 plus, Fully satisfied",
            "Easy to use, looks really nice, comfortable to wear and a good size. Great for running and love the music function. I was a bit worried about reviews saying they couldn't pair headphones but after a bit of perseverance I had no problem. Make sure your headphones are genuinely in pairing mode!",
            "Recommend this watch.  just what I wanted actually life changing",
            "Bought this for the missus. She\u2019s still happy with it 12 months later! Works well and looks fashionable.",
            "Bin sehr ungl\u00fccklich. Die Uhr an sich schaut toll aus, sitzt auch angenehm aber die Schrittmessung ist v\u00f6llig unbrauchbar.Keine Ahnung, ob sie jede Armbewegung mitz\u00e4hlt aber bei mir stehen schon kurz nach dem Aufstehen 350 Schritte auf dem Z\u00e4hler und bis zum Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck sind es dann gl\u00fccklich 1.200.....Die Gebrauchsanweisung ist ein pures disaster - die Funktionen zu finden und einzustellen ist ein stundenlanges try and errorHilfen zu dieser Uhr findet man auch praktisch noch keine im Netz, so dass ich sie leider zur\u00fcckschicken muss.SEHR schade, weil es endlich eine Fitnessuhr ist, die man auch als Frau gerne tragen w\u00fcrde",
            "Habe den Tracker ausprobiert und war echt entt\u00e4uscht. Optik und Haptik ist toll, aber der Akku war super schnell leer, z. T. schon nach 2 Stunden (ohne Herzfrequenzmessung, alle Sonderfunktionen und Bluetooth aus). Dachte es sei ein Montagsmodell, aber die Ersatzlieferung zeigt ab dem 2.Tag das selbe Ladeverhalten. F\u00fcr mich nicht brauchbar. Mein Mann hat die gr\u00f6\u00dfere VIVOSMART 4 und ist sehr zufrieden(Akkulaufzeit trotz Benachrichtigung, Bluetooth und Dauerherzfrequenzmessung ist mehrere Tage).Hab jetzt ein HonorBand 5 - zu einem F\u00fcnftel des Preises! - und bin sehr zufrieden.",
            "Does everything I needed it to well please with it.",
            "Exactly as expected!",
            "Eigentlich sollte meine Frau eine Vivomove Style als Ersatz f\u00fcr ihre Vivomove HR bekommen (die nach 3 Jahren immer noch l\u00e4uft).Leider hielt da der Akku nur 6 Stunden, selbst nach Werksreset ohne jegliche Benutzung, daher die Vivoactive 4Design:Ja, die Vivoactive 4 kann nicht mit einer Vivomove Style mithalten.Allerdings ist sie nicht \"h\u00e4sslich\" nur eben anders.Daher hier kein Einfluss auf die Bewertung.Display:Die Zeiten der fetten R\u00e4nder um die Displays... daher \"verschenktem\" Platz sind eigentlich vorbei.Nur bei Garmin nicht.Bei Garmin wird genug Platz gelassen um noch ein paar Post-Its auf die Uhr zu kleben, ohne das Display zu verdecken. Das macht die Uhren entweder unn\u00f6tig gro\u00df... oder die Displays unn\u00f6tig klein.Bei der Vivomove 4 S f\u00e4llt der schwarze Rand besonders auf.Bei anderen Herstellern hat der Rand meist eine Funktion, oder wird durch eine L\u00fcnette abgedeckt.\u00dcber die Art des Displays gibt es nicht viel zu sagen... Es hat seine Vor und Nachteile und man wei\u00df eigentlich worauf man sich einl\u00e4sst. Die vergleichsweise lange Akkulaufzeit liegt nun mal auch im Display begr\u00fcndet.Akkulaufzeit:Hier kommt der Punkt bei dem Garmin noch vorn liegt (Sofern die Firmware mitspielt)3 Tage mit je 1 Stunde GPS am Tag sind durchaus m\u00f6glich.Man muss jedoch die Auto Aktivit\u00e4tserkennung abschalten. Sonst meint die Uhr bei jedem Besuch im Westfl\u00fcgel das GPS anwerfen zu m\u00fcssen, was auf die Laufzeit geht.Funktionen:Die Frau nutzt sie zum Pilates, Gehen, Radfahren und f\u00fcr den Notfall hat sie noch meine KK mit Garmin Pay.Der Schnickschnack wie Mentruationskalender, Wasserkonsum etc. wurde deaktiviert.VO2 brauchen wir nicht... erst recht nicht beim Schlafen.Pulsfunktion ist 24h aktiv.Musikfunktionen nutzen wir ebenfalls nicht.Die Uhr bietet so wesentlich mehr Funktionen als ben\u00f6tigt (Daher war die Vivomove Reihe unser Favorit)Die Funktionen die wir nutzen, sind Problemfrei.Connectivit\u00e4t:BLE funktionierte bei Garmin eigentlich immer. WLAN braucht es f\u00fcr unsere Einsatzzwecke nicht.Wichtiger Punkt... die App wird immer besser und da Endomondo seinen Dienst Ende des Jahres einstellt. f\u00fcr uns fast alternativlos.Smart Watch:Garmin Pay und dazu noch eingehende Nachrichten/Anrufe anzeigen.Wichtigste Funktion ist wohl \"Handy suchen\"Fazit.Die Uhr ist nicht unsere 1. Wahl, erf\u00fcllt jedoch ihren Zweck.1 Stern Abzug f\u00fcr den verschwendeten Platz vom Display.An den Funktionen die WIR  nutzen gibt es nix zu meckern.Akkulaufzeit ist immer noch gut... aber so langsam holen die Mitbewerber auf.@ Garmin und ohne Einfluss auf die Bewertung.Akkulaufzeit, Pay Funktionen ... die Konkurrenz ist dran und bietet zudem meist Wireless Charging.Das Gefummel mit dem seit ~15 Monaten eingef\u00fchrtem Ladestecker ist so was an der Zeit vorbei und auch die Daten\u00fcbertragung via Basecamp (betrifft eher Fenix/Oregon etc.)  und USB ist weit \u00fcberholt.Dazu noch Metall statt Plastik. (welches sich nach ein paar Monaten auch gern verf\u00e4rbt)Wir haben zur Garmin gegriffen, weil sie noch das bessere Bundle f\u00fcr uns ist... nach den Entt\u00e4uschungen mit der Fenix, dem Oregon 700 und der Vivomove Style schaut man doch etwas interessierter in Nachbars Garten.Zumal unsere Kritik ziemlich \u00e4hnlich zu der aus dem restlichen Bereich der Community ist.",

Ich hab den Akku auf 100 Prozent geladen denn ich wollte an dem Tag wandern gehen. Nach einer Stunde Autofahrt schaue ich auf die Uhr und sie hatte noch 67Prozent ohne das sie mit dem Telefon verbunden war. Alles war ausgeschalten. Ich aktivierte also ein sportprofil um endlich starten zu k\u00f6nnen und nach einer weiteren Stunde war der Akku leer.Also 2 Stunden von 100 Prozent auf 0...Geht einfach gar nicht.

            "Awesome watch, what it can do is unbelievable",
            "Meine Frau w\u00fcnschte sich eine Sportuhr. Als zufriedener Besitzer einer Fenix 5 war also Garmin schon mal gesetzt. Die Frage war also Fenix 6S Pro oder Vivoactive 4S. Meiner Frau mit d\u00fcnnem Handgelenk gefiel die  Vivoactive 4S besser, da sie optisch flacher erscheint.Nach den ersten Tagen zeigte sich jedoch, dass die Akkulaufzeit der Schwachpunkt der Uhr ist. Nur mit der normalen Pulsmessung, mit wenigen Smartphone Benachrichtigungen und keinen sportlichen Aktivit\u00e4ten liegt der Verbrauch bei 20-25% am Tag. Kommen dann noch sportliche Aktivit\u00e4ten hinzu, wird es noch enger. Eine Radfahrt von 100 Minuten mit Pulsmessung und GPS verbrauchte 19% Akkukapazit\u00e4t. Die Uhr ist also nur f\u00fcr Menschen, die wenige kurze sportliche Aktivit\u00e4ten haben oder bereit sind die Uhr oft zu laden. Die Bedienung und Funktionalit\u00e4t in den Anwendungen ist \u00fcber jeden Zweifel erhaben. Nur der Akku erf\u00fcllt den Anspruch leider nicht.Wir schicken Sie zur\u00fcck und haben daf\u00fcr die Fenix 6S Pro bestellt. Bei dieser zeigt sich, dass die Akkulaufzeit wirklich bei 7 Tagen liegt und die gleiche Radfahrt von 100 Minuten verbrauchte nur 10%. Der optisch vermeintliche Unterschied in der Dicke bel\u00e4uft sich in der Realit\u00e4t nur auf ein paar Millimeter und das gleiche Design in Kupfer/Wei\u00df ist auch erh\u00e4ltlich. Mit der Fenix 6S Pro muss man sich also nicht vor jeder spontanen l\u00e4ngeren sportlichen Aktivit\u00e4t noch schnell ein Ladekabel suchen, nur um nicht unterwegs eine leere Uhr zu haben.",
            "The watch wasn't in the Garmin box",

            "Ich bin begeistert. Ich muss dazu sagen, dass ich nicht zu den Leuten geh\u00f6re, die 5 x die Woche eine Stunde mit GPS joggen gehen. Aber ich gehe 3x die Woche f\u00fcr mehrere Stunden zum Training (Cardio+Krafttraining) und bin mit der Akku-Leistung vollkommen zufrieden. H\u00e4lt der Akku dann eine Woche? Nein, tut er nicht. Und ich brauche auch kein GPS. Aber der Akku l\u00e4dt sensationell schnell. Ich h\u00e4nge sie morgens vor dem Duschen ans Ladekabel, mache mich fertig und eine knappe Stunde sp\u00e4ter ist sie von 7% auf 95% geladen. Das st\u00f6rt mich also gar nicht.Die Musikfunktion funktioniert ebenfalls super, meine Bluetooth-Kopfh\u00f6rer werden sofort erkannt und die \u00dcbertragung klappt einfach. Das Fitnesstracking beispielsweise beim Spinning funktioniert einwandfrei und sie ist kompatibel mit meinem Polar-Herzfrequenzsensor (sogar besser als meine Polar-Uhr).Auch optisch finde ich die Uhr einfach h\u00fcbsch. Sie hat auch f\u00fcr mein Handgelenk genau die richtige Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, ohne wuchtig zu wirken.Fazit: F\u00fcr mich einfach die richtige Uhr. Ein gr\u00f6\u00dferer oder leistungsf\u00e4higerer Akku w\u00fcrde die Uhr auch wieder gr\u00f6\u00dfer machen und f\u00fcr meine Zwecke reicht der Akku aus, auch und nicht zuletzt aufgrund der Tatsache, dass die Ladezeit f\u00fcr mich echt in Ordnung ist.Ich war durch die teils sehr negativen Rezensionen stark verunsichert und bin froh, dass ich es einfach ausprobiert habe.",
            "VERY bad quality... Couldn't read even on screen ..",
            "Present for wife.Looks great.Ideal for petite wrists.Great running watch",
            "Brilliant watch and looks good too!",
            "Very happy with this Garmin watch",
            "El dise\u00f1o es lo que mas me gusta.Es el segundo art\u00edculo de Garmin que tengo. El primero me dej\u00f3 decepcionada pero entend\u00ed que era porque yo necesitaba prestaciones que una pulsera de actividad no me da (Pay, m\u00fasica, avisos...)Estoy satisfecha con su dise\u00f1o y precisi\u00f3n, las aplicaciones que ofrece y en general podr\u00eda incluso recomendar.No obstante, para un reloj que cuesta casi 300 euros, creo que la calidad de la pantalla y color no son nada adecuados. No tiene brillo.... Me gustar\u00eda ver un color de la calidad de un pilar, Xiaomi, Fitbit.... Vamos, que cualquier marca tiene una pantalla con m\u00e1s luz. En el anuncio esto no se aprecia. Es enga\u00f1oso incluso porque las im\u00e1genes prestan a creer que ver el reloj es como ver una pantalla de m\u00f3vil que no es el caso. Apenas tiene color y el que tienes muy apagado. Es posible que a\u00fan sabi\u00e9ndolo, lo hubiera comprado, pero no s\u00e9 debe de enga\u00f1ar con algo as\u00ed. Os voy a mostrar una foto con el brillo m\u00e1ximo para que lo ve\u00e1is.Echo en falta que tome el pulso. Tambi\u00e9n que la aplicaci\u00f3n explique para que sirven muchos de los par\u00e1metros que s\u00ed registra (ox\u00edgeno, nivel de estr\u00e9s, etc). O sea, que hay mucha informaci\u00f3n que no se interpretar y llevo a\u00f1os con relojes deportivos. Quer\u00eda este m\u00e1s completo pero no es un \"Wow\".La aplicaci\u00f3n \"pay\" funciona, pero la contrase\u00f1a la pide una vez y luego puedes usarlo todo el d\u00eda sin que vuelva a pedir el pin. Esto es un riesgo muy grande en caso de perdida o robo.La bater\u00eda, si eres una persona activa, dura 3 d\u00edas como mucho. En reposo dura mucho m\u00e1s, pero es un reloj deportivo. Deber\u00eda de tener m\u00e1s duraci\u00f3n.En resumen, relaci\u00f3n calidad precio..... No estoy impresionada, aunque por lo bonito y elegante que es, y la precisi\u00f3n a la hora de medir, estoy satisfecha.",
            "Rein optisch und von der Bedienung her bekommt die Uhr von mir volle 5 Sterne! Sie sieht sehr edel aus, insbesondere an einem schmaleren Frauen Handgelenk. Die Bedienung ist sehr leicht und funktioniert einwandfrei.Ich nutze sie t\u00e4glich f\u00fcr sportliche Aktivit\u00e4ten (Laufbandtraining und Krafttraining). Das macht sich nat\u00fcrlich am Akku bemerkbar. Alle 3 Tage sp\u00e4testens muss geladen werden (und das ohne GPS Nutzung!). Finde ich pers\u00f6nlich etwas ungewohnt, aber ist nicht weiter st\u00f6rend soweit man sich erstmal dran gew\u00f6hnt hat.Nach drei Wochen intensiver Nutzung kann ich folgende Feedbacks geben:- Tracken von Aktivit\u00e4ten klappt einwandfrei; auch Verbindung und Erkennung mit dem Brustgurt problemlos. Beim Krafttraining k\u00f6nnen Pausenzeiten getrackt werden, w\u00e4hrend dessen der Puls angezeigt wird. S\u00e4tze und Wiederholungen werden getrackt (stimmt aber nicht immer - ist mir pers\u00f6nlich aber unwichtig). Beim Cardio/Laufband Training wird der Puls und die Pace angezeigt. Die Distanz stimmt nicht immer (ohne GPS!). Insgesamt sehr gut um Aktivit\u00e4ten zu tracken.- Schritte: erschienen mir bisher immer logisch und recht genau. Gestern hatte ich leider den Fall, dass f\u00fcr gleiche Strecke, die sonst etwa 7000 Schritte war (exakt die selbe) nur 4000 Schritte gez\u00e4hlt wurden. Auch die Aktivit\u00e4tskalorien hingen fest bei 400, egal wie aktiv ich den restlichen tag noch war. Schritte wurden dann weiter gez\u00e4hlt, waren bei 12000. Beim n\u00e4chsten Mal auf die Uhr schauen waren sie wieder bei 9000 und haben gar nicht mehr gez\u00e4hlt. Sehr unsch\u00f6n ! Habe dann ein Software Update installiert und die Uhr aus- und wieder an geschaltet. Seitdem funktioniert es erstmal wieder, bin aber gespannt ob der Fehler nochmal auftritt. Nach drei Wochen Nutzung nat\u00fcrlich sehr schade und entt\u00e4uschend (Schritte waren weg, h\u00e4tten an dem Tag bei knapp 20000 sein m\u00fcssen).- Kalorienangaben: Sind nat\u00fcrlich nur Richtwerte und Sch\u00e4tzungen und sollten niemals zu genau genommen werden. Dennoch zeigt die Uhr einen viel zu geringen Wert an bei mir (Aktivit\u00e4tskalorien). Das ist f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich aber vernachl\u00e4ssigbar (wie gesagt, nur ein Richtwert).- Schlaf: Leider ein Manko, das bisher jede Garmin Uhr hatte bei mir (habe jetzt die 4. Uhr von der Marke). Ich liege die halbe Nacht wach und kann nicht schlafen (3 Stunden Wachzeit) und die Uhr erkennt das ALLES als Schlaf. Stimmt also \u00fcberhaupt nicht \u00fcberein. Und die N\u00e4chte, wo ich gef\u00fchlt tief wie ein Baby geschlafen habe: Kaum Tiefschlaf, nur leichter Schlaf. Sehr schade !!Alles in allem eine solide Uhr, die allerdings nicht allzu genau hin kommt in vielen Messungen. Dennoch ein nettes Spielzeug. Man kann zB auch seinen Zyklus tracken (was leider auch nicht so ganz funktioniert; die Uhr sagt , heute ist Tag 1 deiner Periode und man kann es zwar ausstellen, sofern sie nicht an genau diesem Tag kam, aber es springt immer wieder zur\u00fcck), Fl\u00fcssigkeitsaufnahme eingeben (nettes Tool) und seinen Stresswert anschauen.2 Sterne Abzug wegen Schlaf Ungenauigkeit und dem H\u00e4nger mit den Schritten gestern, sowie die kontant zu niedrigen Aktiv Kalorien und dem schnellen Akkuverbrauch.",
            "Consegna eccezionale da parte di Amazon, tuttavia l'orologio \u00e8 bello ma per funzionare con Iphone ha bisogno di molta applicazione e dell'aiuto del centro assistenza GArmin, l'ho dovuto resettare piu e piu volte e spero che adesso tutto funzioni, Garmin scrive sul suo sito che possono esservi problemi, ma questi sono oltre ogni immaginazione, bravi anche i ragazzi dell'assistenza Garmin.

La tendenza attuale  sono ormai gli amoled, cosa che garmin ha implementato su un'altra linea. Grande Gps con due tecnologie satellitari. Peccato che dopo un mese il gps si \u00e8 rotto. Restituito.

            "Ich war ja sehr skeptisch so viel Geld f\u00fcr eine Uhr auszugeben, aber nach kurzer Zeit stellte ich viele Vorteile fest. Ich bin recht sportlich (Tennis, reiten, joggen, Yoga, Bauch-Beine-Po) und habe Dank der Uhr mich beim Joggen sehr verbessert (\u00fcber den Winter 5-km Trainingsplan befolgt). Joggen war bisher f\u00fcr mich ein Ausgleich zu den anderen Sportarten, aber nun hab ich tats\u00e4chlich Spa\u00df daran und schaffe auch 1mal die Woche locker 10 km am St\u00fcck.Was mir sehr gut gef\u00e4llt:+ Musik h\u00f6ren \u00fcber die Uhr -> endlich kein Mitschleppen des Smartphones beim Joggen+ Kann Trainingspl\u00e4ne f\u00fcrs Reiten erstellen (\u00fcber Sportart Radfahren), d.h. Uhr vibriert nach eingestellter Zeit, damit ich wei\u00df, wann ich nach dem Schritt mit der L\u00f6sungsphase anfangen kann und mit der Arbeitsphase wieder durch sein sollte + kann mir Notizen machen/ Ziele des Trainings vermerken (gerade beim Reiten mehrere Pferde n\u00fctzlich)+ Akku ist schnell geladen (wenn ich vor dem Joggen merke, dass ich nur noch 17% habe, h\u00e4nge ich die Uhr 10 Minuten ans Ladeger\u00e4t und es reicht auf jeden Fall f\u00fcr 1 Stunde joggen mit Musik und GPS)+ Akku h\u00e4lt bei mir 5 Tage trotz t\u00e4glich getracktem Sport, allerdings mit ein paar Einstellungen wie Displaysperre, Ausschalten von diversen f\u00fcr mich unn\u00f6tige BenachrichtigungenWas mir negativ auffiel:- wenn ich 2 eigen erstellte Trainingspl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr den gleichen Tag eingeplant habe, kommt beim Starten die Uhr manchmal durcheinander, d.h. ich w\u00e4hle Training A aus und es startet aber mit B- Notfallanruf funktioniert nicht. Hatte 2 ordentliche St\u00fcrze mit dem Mountainbike, aber Notruf ging nicht los, obwohl mein Smartphone in unmittelbarer N\u00e4he war. Einmal wollte der Notruf los gehen als ich mit dem MTB einen steileren Berg runter fuhr, allerdings nicht st\u00fcrzte. Also unterm Strich funktioniert diese Funktion leider nicht.- Reiten muss man \u00fcber Radfahren einstellen, ansonsten z\u00e4hlt es die Schritte mit. Gibt zwar eine App f\u00fcr Horsemanship, aber die war f\u00fcr mich nicht n\u00fctzlich. F\u00fcr mich sind die eigen erstelle Trainingspl\u00e4ne wichtig.- Musik Playlist muss meistens nach Software-Updates erneut heruntergeladen werden. Da es nur umst\u00e4ndlich \u00fcber Hotspot funktioniert und man die fehlende Playlist meistens erst merkt, wenn man los laufen will, ist nervig.Im November 2020 hab ich mir die Uhr zugelegt. Durch einen Fahrradsturz auf den Asphalt ging mir nun das Uhrenglas in viele kleine Einzelteile zu Bruch (Foto). Zum Gl\u00fcck hatte ich die Uhr versichert und die Abwicklung war nun unkompliziert (Gutschein f\u00fcr eine neue Uhr). Ich habe nun die Vivoactive 4s mit der Venu 2s online verglichen, aber ich glaube, ich werde wieder die Vivoactive 4s nehmen. Denn ich sehe tats\u00e4chlich in dem alten Display mehr Vorteile, wie z.B. display always on bei Vivoactive 4s, sowie Lesbarkeit im Sonnenlicht.  Von den Funktionen her sehe ich bei der venu 2s kaum Vorteile. HIIT gibt es als Traininsplan auch bei der Vivoactive 4s, allerdings nicht als einstellbare Sportart (aber brauch ich die? W\u00fcrde Cardio oder Pilates einstellen). Zum Schlafen zieh ich generell die Uhr aus, daher ist die bessere Schlafanalyse f\u00fcr mich nicht interessant.",
            "Esperaba la pantalla m\u00e1s grande ! Pero al usarlo me enamore ! Estaba acostumbrada al Apple Watch y me costo un poco de trabajo adaptarme a las funciones de este reloj, pero una vez que le agarras el modo es fant\u00e1stico. Lo que m\u00e1s me gusta es el dise\u00f1o y que me mide la calidad del sue\u00f1o y cu\u00e1nto tiempo est\u00e1s en sue\u00f1o REM, profundo o ligero. Lo recomiendo",
            "Ich habe nun diese Uhr \u00fcber l\u00e4ngerer Zeit hin getestet und muss leider sagen, dass das Preisleistungsverh\u00e4ltnis absolut nicht ok ist.Mit der Akkulaufzeit habe ich keine Probleme,  aber allerdings mit der Ungenauigkeit was die verschiedenen Workouts betrifft.So mache ich beispielsweise 10 liegest\u00fctze und tats\u00e4chlich gez\u00e4hlt werden nur 4, das gleiche mit chruches und vielen weiteren \u00dcbungen.  Und ja, die \u00dcbungen werden korrekt ausgef\u00fchrt,  daran liegt es 100 prozentig nicht.Ebenso hat die Uhr auch Probleme mit den Kalorienverbrauch.  Ein gem\u00fctlicher Spaziergang von 15 Minuten zum Beispiel zeigt mir einen Kalorienverbrauch von 70 an, 40 Minuten joggen mit einen pace von 5,47 einen Verbrauch von 145 Kalorien.  Das ist lachhaft. Und das ganze kam nicht nur einmal vor.Witzig ist auch, wenn man beispielsweise 10 Kilometer gejoggt ist, und man ruht sich danach aus, dauert es nicht lange bis einen die Uhr daran erinnert,  das es f\u00fcr eine Aktivit\u00e4t Zeit wird.Dann letztens der total Ausfall von der garmin Conectapp,  welcher Tage gedauert hat.Ich habe lange Zeit einen g\u00fcnstigen Fitnesstracker benutzt und wollte mir etwas gutes g\u00f6nnen und habe mir diese Uhr angeschafft und muss sagen, ich bin ma\u00dflos entt\u00e4uscht. Benutze die Uhr  jetzt weiter, aber wenn sie kaputt ist, werde ich mir nie wieder eine garmin holen. Steht wirklich zu keinen Verh\u00e4ltniss zueinander!",

Zum Einen finde ich, es gibt hier wesentlich bessere Apps (ist aber Geschmackssache) zum Anderen ist diese Kombi bei dem teuren Kaufpreis schlichtweg nicht in Ordnung. Daher keine Kaufempfehlung",
            "Ich habe stundenlang nach einer neuen SmartWatch gesucht. Viele Uhren w\u00e4ren beinahe in meinem Einkaufswagen gelandet, aber meist schreckte irgendein Nachteil ab.Mit der vivoactive 4S bin ich aber sehr zufrieden.Der Akku h\u00e4lt wirklich sehr lange. Ich lade sie je nach Aktivit\u00e4t ca. zweimal in der Woche auf. Sie ist auch sehr schnell aufgeladen, so dass die Uhr nach ca. 2h wieder einsatzbereit ist.Die Uhr tr\u00e4gt sich angenehm und hat vor allem f\u00fcr Sportfreunde zusammen mit der App recht viel Auswahl was Sportprogramme angeht.Man kann per App entweder selber das Design der Oberfl\u00e4che erstellen oder l\u00e4dt sich ein Design herunter. Man kann als Hintergrund zum Beispiel eigene Bilder einf\u00fcgen. Das ist sehr sch\u00f6n.Die Bedienung ist nicht immer ganz intuitiv, aber wenn man einmal verstanden hat, wie es geht, dann ist es einfach.Wichtig f\u00fcr mich war neben der langen Akku-Laufzeit, dass mich die Uhr auch zuverl\u00e4ssig morgens weckt. Das funktioniert auch einwandfrei.Ich bin rundum mit der Uhr zufrieden. Nur zwei kleine Mankos st\u00f6ren....Man kann mit der Uhr selbst nicht telefonieren und das Tracking des Schlafs funktioniert \u00fcberhaupt nicht. Sitzt man abends ruhig auf der Couch und schaut einen Film, wird dies als Tiefschlaf angezeigt. Da war meine Fitbit Charge 2 deutlich zuverl\u00e4ssiger. Wer also seinen Schlaf tracken m\u00f6chte, sollte sich lieber eine andere Uhr suchen.",

Einzig die Stockwerkerkennung liegt bei mir fast immer v\u00f6llig daneben. Wirklich indiskutabel ist allerdings der Umstand, dass ich nach nur 6 Tagen tragen der Uhr eine Allergie am Handgelenk entwickelt habe. Also ganz im Ernst das darf bei einer Uhr f\u00fcr 300,- \u20ac einfach nicht passieren - insbesondere da mir das noch nie passiert ist.Ich habe mir jetzt von einem anderen Hersteller zwei Ersatzarmb\u00e4nder bestellt und hoffe, dass das Problem damit beseitigt ist, da ich die Uhr sonst mag und gerne weiter nutzen w\u00fcrde.Schon sehr traurig bei einem so renommierten Hersteller wie Garmin.",
            "la consegna ha ritardato di 4 giorni ed \u00e8 per questo che ho dovuto farmelo consegnare in un altra citt\u00e0.L'orologio esteticamente \u00e8 molto carino, elegante e discreto, ma questi sono le uniche note positive.Ia dimensione del display \u00e8 molto inferiore a quella che si percepisce in foto e la qualit\u00e0 non \u00e8 degna di un Garmin. Per lo stesso prezzo meglio prendere il Huawei (solo che il quadrante \u00e8 molto grande) e quello pi\u00f9 piccolo non puoi rispondere alle chiamate. Ma Nemmeno con il Garmin potevi rispondere direttamente con l'orologio.  Dall'orologio in se, non puoi vedere granch\u00e9 ( il dettaglio del sonno, la stima giornaliera o settimanale ecc.) ma puoi vederlo solo dall'applicazione che per me non \u00e8 assolutamente intuitiva.Per tutti questi motivi decido che non vale 250 euro spesi. Avrei potuto usarlo tutto il mese e poi renderlo ma non mi sembrava corretto dato che avevo gi\u00e0 preso la mia decisione e che cos\u00ec facendo avrei sicuramente rovinato il quadrante e per rispetto di un futuro acquirente ho reso l'orologio dopo una settimana. Purtroppo il reso \u00e8 arrivato al destinatario vuoto quindi non ho ricevuto il rimborso.  sono stata derubata e l'assistenza Amazon (quella che si occupa solo di questi problemi) mi ha veramente deluso, sono stata trattata malissimo senza poter avere un confronto con un essere umano.L'assistenza normale \u00e8 sempre stata gentile e disponibile, mi ha consigliato, dato che i resi non sono assicurati, di andare a fare il reso direttamente alla posta. ( Cos\u00ec forse il rischio di furto da parte di ignoti \u00e8 minore).Oppure forse conviene fare un video senza stacchi dove mettete l'orologio nel pacco e lo consegnate al corriere.Morale della favola Ho fatto denuncia di furto. Sono senza orologio e senza soldi. Mi spiace davvero molto per l'accaduto per me \u00e8 stato un duro colpo perdere questi soldi e spero di poter risolvere il problema.",

F\u00fcr eine tempor\u00e4re Einsch\u00e4tzung der O2-S\u00e4ttigung oder die Schlaftiefe ist es gut m\u00f6glich, sich einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber den allgemeinen Fitnesszustand oder Stresslevel zu verschaffen. Das muss nicht immer eingestellt werden. Und dadurch ist der individuellen Nutzung der Uhr fast keine Grenzegesetzt.

Sie ist nicht klobig und wirkt in wei\u00df mit goldenem Rand feminin und stylisch.

Hier ist f\u00fcr jeden etwas dabei.Tragekomfort:Zun\u00e4chst habe ich die Uhr auch Nachts getragen, um meinen Schlaf zu tracken. Daran habe ich nach einer gewissen Zeit den Spa\u00df verloren. Hinzukam, dass es meiner Haut nicht gut tat das Kunststoffarmband rund um die Uhr zu tragen. Ein Lederarmband w\u00e4re hier sicherlich angenehmer. Beim \u201enormalen\u201c Gebrauch im Alltag bleiben diese Probleme jedoch aus und die Uhr tr\u00e4gt sich sehr angenehm.Akku Leistung:Der Akku h\u00e4lt bei Dauer-Tageseinsatz etwa drei Tage. Ich bem\u00fche jedoch die Uhr nachts auszuschalten und die Bluetooth-Funktion - sofern nicht ben\u00f6tigt - ausgeschaltet zu halten. Bei eingeschalteter Bluetooth-Funktion h\u00e4lt der Akku weniger lange.Garmin-App:Um die Uhr mit dem Handy zu koppeln und eine detaillierte Trainingsauswertung zu erhalten, muss die Garmin App installiert werden. Die Kopplung mit der App funktioniert problemlos. Die App ist \u00fcbersichtlich gestaltet und Auswertung des Trainings ist detailliert und gut nachvollziehbar.Nun zum Thema Einsatz w\u00e4hrend des Trainings:Ich wollte in erster Linie eine Uhr haben, die meine Schritte z\u00e4hlt und mich w\u00e4hrend des Joggens begleitet. Hierf\u00fcr erf\u00fcllt sie absolut ihren Zweck. Die Uhr l\u00e4sst sich so einstellen, dass sie Aktivit\u00e4ten wie gehen und joggen nach einer gewissen Zeit alleine startet. Sie misst zuverl\u00e4ssig meine Herzfrequenz und es l\u00e4sst sich in der App hinterher die gelaufene Strecke nachvollziehen. Beim joggen fehlt mir ein wenig ein Warnsignal, wenn man einen gewissen Herzfrequenzbereich \u00fcberschreitet. Dies w\u00e4re eine sch\u00f6ne Erg\u00e4nzung.Nun zu meinen negativen Trainings-Erfahrungen mit der Uhr:Die Stockwerk-Z\u00e4hlung funktioniert nicht immer einwandfrei.  H\u00e4ufig zeigt die Uhr erreichte Stockwerke-Ziele, ohne dass ich tats\u00e4chlich Stufen gegangen bin. Dies geschieht gelegentlich, wenn ich zu joggen beginne oder einen Aufzug nutze. Nicht ganz korrekt sind auch die Z\u00e4hlung der Wiederholungszahl beim Krafttraining sowie die Z\u00e4hlung der Bahnen beim Schwimmen. Ich habe hier den Eindruck, dass die Uhr  komplexere Bewegungsabl\u00e4ufe noch nicht richtig erkennt. Hier gibt es sicher noch Verbesserungsm\u00f6glichkeiten.",
            "Sono fedele a Garmin da sempre. Ho acquistato Vivoactive 4s dopo che anche il mio secondo Forerunner 645 Music mi ha abbandonata. Provenendo io da un orologio molto \"tecnico\" per la corsa, ma meno \"smartwatch\" (il Forerunner non ha nemmeno il touchscreen) ho apprezzato molto questo modello, che unisce un'ottima funzionalit\u00e0 negli sport ma \u00e8 molto pi\u00f9 comodo dell'altro nella vita di tutti i giorni. Il touchscreen rende molto pi\u00f9 semplice l'utilizzo dell'orologio e la connessione bluetooth con il telefono \u00e8 stabile mentre il Forerunner si disconnetteva continuamente, non so se fosse un problema del mio o se sia normale. Al momento ho utilizzato Vivoactive 4s nell'attivit\u00e0 cardio e nella corsa, sempre abbinato alla fascia HRM Dual, e nel nuoto in piscina. Nella corsa ovviamente fornisce dati base e non avanzati come il Forerunner, ma per un amatore senza pretese sono pi\u00f9 che sufficienti. Nel nuoto in piscina tende a sovrastimare leggermente il numero di vasche, ma nulla di tragico (circa il 5/10% in pi\u00f9 rispetto alla distanza effettivamente percorsa). Nel nuoto rileva il battito cardiaco dal polso, ma vedendo il grafico mi pare pi\u00f9 una stima che altro. La batteria dura tranquillamente una settimana utilizzato in modalit\u00e0 smartwatch + 4 sessioni di allenamento da un'ora. Lo consiglio a chi cerca uno smartwatch esteticamente carino ma che sia anche un compagno di allenamento sufficientemente affidabile.",
            "Ich habe von der Vivomove HR zur Vivoactive 4s gewechselt um mal ein paar mehr gadgets und Funktionen zu haben. Leider bin ich f\u00fcr den Preis nicht zufrieden. Die Displayqualit\u00e4t ist unteres Mittelma\u00df (vor allem f\u00fcr den Preis) und die vorinstallierten animieren \u00dcbungen (wie z.B. Yoga), die mich haupts\u00e4chlich zu dieser Uhr gebracht haben, bringen schon einen mittelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Sportler zum einschlafen. Sehr nett gedacht, aber leider noch schlecht umgesetzt.F\u00fcr 60-80\u20ac mehr gibt es die schicker anmutende Venu.Die Vivoactive 4s wirkt selbst an meinem kleinen Arm (1,58m-Frau) total klein und vor allem hoch und billig. Leider also nichts f\u00fcr mich.",
            "He tenido todos los Vivoactive, con el 3 estaba muy contenta, pero para mujer sigue siendo grande y no queda bien a mi parecer , es por ello que al ver \u00e9ste quise cambiarlo. La talla 4s queda estupenda, de tama\u00f1o es como un reloj normal, lo que implica que hay cosas que si te falla un poco la vista de cerca , te costar\u00e1 ver, como los res\u00famenes de las actividades, ahora el resumen es m\u00e1s chulo pero se ve muy peque\u00f1ito!**** He borrado mi anterior opini\u00f3n sobre la bater\u00eda puesto que lleva m\u00e1s d\u00edas prob\u00e1ndolo y con 30 minutos m\u00ednimo de ejercicio al d\u00eda est\u00e1 consumiendo un 20% por d\u00eda, un  poco m\u00e1s  si activas el pulsiox\u00edmetro, as\u00ed que viene a ser la misma duraci\u00f3n que el Vivoactive 3 o m\u00e1s... as\u00ed que de momento no voy a quejarme que me gusta mucho !!",
            "Das war die zweite Garmin, die ich nun ausprobiert habe. Bei dieser war ich anfangs eigentlich ganz zufrieden. Obwohl ich bei dem Preis erwartet h\u00e4tte, dass das Display ein bisschen mehr nach 2021 aussieht und weniger wie das erste Farbdisplay beim Nokia.Die Einrichtung und Bedienung ist einfach. Toll finde ich die Streckenerkennung beim Laufen. Am Ende kann man die komplette Route mit allen Infos auf der App anschauen.Der Grund, warum ich sie zur\u00fcckgeschickt habe ist der Kalorientracker. An einem ruhigen Sonntag, wo ich lediglich 1h spazieren und insgesamt 7800 Schritte gelaufen war, zeigte die Uhr am Ende des Tages einen Gesamtverbrauch von 2000kcal. Am Tag danach war ich arbeiten und danach laufen und hatte insgesamt 16000 Schritte gemacht. Da hatte ich am Ende des Tages nur einen Gesamtverbrauch von 1800kcal.Ich kann also von der Uhr ehrlich gesagt nur abraten.",
            "Ich glaube ich habe ein \"Montagsprodukt\" erwischt. Ich kann die guten Rezensionen nicht best\u00e4tigen.Die Garmin zeichnet meine Schlafzeiten nicht wirklich korrekt auf. Wenn ich bereits eine halbe Stunde wach bin, zeigt sie sp\u00e4ter an, dass ich dann noch geschlafen habe. Das hat mein 30EUR Fitnesstracker mindestens genauso gut gemacht.Wenn ich spazieren gehe (in Hamburg auf dem plattesten Land), zeigt die Uhr an, dass ich \u00fcber 100 Stockwerke gelaufen bin... Stimmt leider so gar nicht!Au\u00dferdem ist es an keinem Tag die Anzahl an Stockwerken runter und wieder rauf. Das sollte es aber sein, da ich an den meisten Tagen immer die selben Stockwerke rauf und runter gehe ....Ob die kcal bei den \u00dcbungen genau angezeigt werden, kann ich nicht beurteilen.",
            "Il prodotto appena arrivato presentava un'anomalia legata al mal funzionamento della retroilluminazione, ma devo sottolineare che il servizio amazon relativo al reso \u00e8 stato impeccabile. In 3 gg hanno gestito il tutto ritirando il vecchio e consegnando il nuovo, che risulta essere perfettamente funzionante, molto bello e funzionale. Lo consiglio, nella versione small soprattutto alle donne.",

            "Eine wirklich sehr sch\u00f6ne und durchdachte Smartwatch, die fast keine W\u00fcnsche offen l\u00e4sst. Das Einrichten der Uhr war einfach. App installiert und verbunden. Die einzelnen Funktionen zu nutzen gelingt am besten durch Learning by doing. Ich war erst skeptisch, ob die Uhr nicht doch zu wuchtig an meinem Handgelenk wirkt, da dieses ziemlich schmal ist. Aber die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe ist super. Schade finde ich, dass die App Garmin Connect nur mit My Fitness Pal die Kalorien synchronisiert. Ich selber nutze Yazio, wo man zwar beide Apps verbinden kann, aber die Kalorien nicht \u00fcbertragen werden. Alles andere funktioniert soweit ganz gut. Akkulaufzeit ist top. Ich w\u00fcrde die Watch empfehlen",

Das Aufzeichnen der Aktivit\u00e4ten klappt super und sie ist auch wirklich wasserdicht.Die Handhabung der Uhr ist etwas knifflig und nicht intuitiv, aber mit der Zeit wei\u00df man, wo alles istPositiv:+ wasserdicht+ leicht+ sch\u00f6nes Design+ integrierte Fitness\u00fcbungen+ schnelles Starten zum Aufzeichnen der \u00dcbungenNegativ:- teuer- kniffelige Men\u00fcf\u00fchrung",

La pantalla se ve de maravilla, porque se adapta a la luz en todo momento.Est\u00e9ticamente es precioso tanto si vas arreglada, c\u00f3mo si vas de entreno.La m\u00fasica con los Airpods Pro se conectan con el sistema Bluetooth, a pesar de ser otra tecnolog\u00eda.En mi caso, el sistema de pago Garmin pay no es compatible con mi banco ING DIRECT, es una pena.En resumen, despues de un Forunner 620, estoy m\u00e1s que satisfecha.",

Usability is Garmin-like, not the nicest but ok.Review of initial watch ordered:After trying the watch for a couple of days it is going back...the battery does not even last a full day, even with all the emitting/receiving functions being switched off (GPS, Bluetooth, Oxymeter etc). I did not even try to play music but assume this would bring down battery life to minutes...Sending this one back and hope a replacement will work better, although I am disappointed with Garmin on bringing out a product that is by far worse than any of its predecessors. I have a Forerunner 735XT already and happy with the battery life so was expecting a lot more (understanding that with Colour Display and music streaming to headphones it will reduce battery life but this performance is not acceptable).

Leider fehlt mir pers\u00f6nlich das Programm \"Wandern\" und der Akku h\u00e4lt durch das GPS nicht wirklich lange (max 2Tage und da schalte ich dir Uhr nach jeder Aktivit\u00e4t einmal Aus und Ein).  Sonst wirklich eine gute Uhr mit super App.",
            "bien para contar los pasos y el pulso. para el resto de par\u00e1metros mirar la app. al final lo usas como reloj, temporizador y para ver rutas de andar/correr con la funci\u00f3n gps. la bater\u00eda dura bastante, casi una semana",
            "Hatte die Vivoactive 4s etwas mehr als ein Monat in Gebrauch, und war sehr zufrieden mit ihr.Doch dann verabschiedete sich die Uhr nach dem Laden mit einem schwarzen Bildschirm, und l\u00e4sst sich nicht mehr einschalten.Bin von der Qualit\u00e4t der Vivoactive 4s schwer entt\u00e4uscht.",
            "Die Uhr ist gut und es funktioniert alles wie es soll. Der Touchscreen hinkt von der Reaktionszeit manchmal ein wenig hinterher. Leider gibt es kein Nordic Walking, da muss man schon Gehen oder Laufen ausw\u00e4hlen und sp\u00e4ter in der App \u00e4ndern.Die Logik und die Technik sind Zweifelsohne sehr gut. Allerdings hatte ich nach den ersten Tagen des Tragens vom Armband einen Hautausschlag. Mit einem Lederarmband konnte ich Abhilfe schaffen.",
            "Se lo he regalado a mi mujer y est\u00e1 encantada, normalmente ha tenido relojes xiaomi y me comenta que este est\u00e1 a a\u00f1os luz. Baraj\u00e9 varios modelos de polar, garmin y suunto, al final me decid\u00ed por este por est\u00e9tica ya que las funciones son similares. Ella lo usa sobre todo para la actividad diaria, an\u00e1lisis de sue\u00f1o y ejercicio de fuerza y aer\u00f3bico indoor.",
            "Ich habe die Uhr inzwischen etwas l\u00e4nger und bin begeistert!  Sie sieht unheimlich h\u00fcbsch aus und ist sehr angenehm zu tragen! Das Band hat sich (noch?) nicht verf\u00e4rbt, trotz Sport! Ich habe alles unn\u00f6tige deinstalliert und so h\u00e4lt der Akku meistens 3 Tage! Aufgeladen ist er sehr schnell. Der H\u00e4ndler war schnell und zuverl\u00e4ssig! Jederzeit wieder!",
            "Me lo regal\u00f3 mi pareja en Navidad, lo he usado desde entonces un mont\u00f3n tanto para deporte, m\u00fasica, uso diario... (6 meses ya) y me encanta. Muy completo, personalizable, preciso, f\u00e1cil de usar, intuitivo y, adem\u00e1s, es bonito. La bater\u00eda dura bastante y se puede cambiar la correa f\u00e1cilmente si decides comprar otra.",
            "Naja... von dem schwerlich bedienbaren touchdisplay bis hin zu einer GPS Ortung, die sage und schreibe 7 Minuten (auf freier Fl\u00e4che und in der Stadt) dauert - absolute Entt\u00e4uschung f\u00fcr das Geld. Mag Sport und Herz Frequenz und alles toll aufzeichnen, daf\u00fcr die 2 Sterne. Der Rest... grottig. Habe von garmin mehr erwartet!Leider bekommt man hier auch sein Geld scheinbar nicht mehr zur\u00fcck. Sehr entt\u00e4uschend!",

Damit kann ich leben.Was mich aber sehr nervt ist, dass die Bluetoothverbindung zum  IPhone st\u00e4ndig weg ist. Ich muss 2-3x am Tag manuell verbinden. Das nervt mich! Habe auch schon die Tipps befolgt, wie neu installieren usw. aber das Problem besteht weiterhin.",

Why I liked this product:- I don't need to recharge it everyday- I don't need to bother starting an activity to get it tracked- I still have good smartwatch capabilities.The only downside is the screen quality, but I prefer to have more battery life than a crisper screen on my watch",

            "For me, battery is good, 2 days lifeThe only drawback was speaker. Talking via speaker was terrible but after software update, it was resolved so changing my review...Overall good choice for wear os...Fast boot up... No lagging",

            "Excellent only down side is the speaker doesn\u2019t work for iPhone.",
            "Exactly as described in item details.  The physical appearance is a very pleasant surprise! It looks very classy with the black metal band and rose gold trim. The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because you have to upload pictures to either Facebook or Instagram to use them as background for watch faces. I love the ease of operation, personalization and navigation between screens and applications.  Easy to read emails, the screen is very clear and sharp.  All in all I'm very happy with this item.  And Fossil customer service is amazing.",
            "Looks great, easy to use. Some technical issues with the Google assistant. Error code in photo. When Googled the error code other users seem to have the same issue. Assistant won't make calls or texts even though permissions are granted. Texts and calls can still be made manually though contacts app.Speaker for calls is surprising good. Very easy set up. So far so good.I've contacted fossil support for Assistant issue. Will update with solution.Update: Fossil has responded, \"Thank you for your response. Regarding this, I would like to announce that our engineering team has acknowledged the issue and is working closely with Google to release a fix soon. Should there be any new updates from them, we will let you know right away.\"Disappointed....",

The product description states that the battery life is good and the watch can be used for multiple days without charging. The utilisation of the watch is not that much, but the battery discharges very soon. Please let me know if this is a battery issue or the watch itself is that way? Amazon, Please verify the seller.",
            "I like that I can answer a call from it and reply to text messages. The only thing I don't love is the watch band, when your working out if your doing yoga and anything where your hand is bend with weight on it the band digs in as well as the 3 buttons on the side. I'll probably buy the replacement silicon bands so I can easily change how tight it is. Other then that all the apps are really great.",

Pero como ya lo mencionaron algo pasa que al actualizarse es casi imposible conectarse a la aplicaci\u00f3n y vincularse (tengo iPhone). Hay que vincular cada que se enciende y la bater\u00eda le dura muy poco. Aunque sin bater\u00eda solo puedes ver la hora. Pero su dise\u00f1o excelente.

S\u00f3lo por alguna incompatibilidad con mi Xiaomi Mi A2 Android 10 el Google Assistant no funcion\u00f3 bien. Y ocurre que soy de brazos delgados, as\u00ed que me qued\u00f3 un poco grande y lo \u00fanico desastroso fue la correa met\u00e1lica, dif\u00edcil de poner y quitar y se desarmaba el broche, por lo que recomendar\u00eda el cambio de correa.

            "First off, this is a men's watch.  It definitely shouldn't be marketed at women's.Secondly, I own over 20 smart watches, and only work them on Android phones.This watch checks off everything I need in a smart watch.1. Reply to texts and emails with ease2. Speaker3. Make calls from watch while phone is nearby charging4. Text from watch5. Can swim with it6. Different battery choices.  Custom us the best7. No lag8. Swap bands 22mm9. Easily can read fonts10. Change watch faces with watchmaker app11.  Can work from watch reading and responding to work related matter while phone is in other room.12. Fitness choices to choose from13. Heart rate monitoringThe only negative is the 1 day battery life.  Maybe 1. 5 days.  But the charger is super fast and I keep it in my bag for work all the time.  Fossil finally stepped up with this Gen 5 compared to previous generations.  Very happy, and Wear OS works great on this watch.",
            "So this is my first smart watch and I love it! It looks like a typical watch but you can customize what watch face (analog, digital, with a theme etc) you like and easily change it with your mood, outfit or season. It's super easy to navigate and figure out, and you can customize the type of notifications you want to receive on your phone (ex: I opted to not know when I get social media notifications but wanted emails and texts). Convinient when doing things since you can take a phone call through the watch and I find people hear me better than being on my phone's speaker. You can also pause music or tv shows that you play through your phone. Easy to sink up to my gallaxy (my partner has an iphone and also had no issue). Battery lasts a full day for me and I check it frequently, get many notifications and have the typically light settings. I get complements on it all the time. I chose the black band and rose gold but notice it also has a light silver circle on the inside which really allows me to wear it with any type of jewelry or outfit making it very easy to coordinate with anything. Definitely worth it. The watch is super secure, comfortable, and you can tell is a good quality watch. The size gets getting used to and a couple tries of adjusting the band to find the right fit for my wrist, but is actually the perfect accent piece, fits comfortably and looks super nice, a lot nicer than the apple ones I think.",
            "This is my first ever smart watch and I absolutely adore it already. Fast, smart and easy to use. So many ways to use just one little watch on your wrist! The strap that comes with it is a little confusing to adjust. But no worries, you have to be 10% smarter than the strap.",
            "This watch looks beautiful, much more like a classic wristwatch than a piece of technology, but it's packed with features - this is for a true techie, not someone looking for a fitness tracker only.I think it will take a while to figure out everything this watch can do because it's basically a computer on your wrist. The face of the watch is big enough that I could even type out a quick message in a pinch. Integrates easily with gmail/other google apps.Love the many options for watch faces and the power saving features are great. Strap is comfortable and pretty easy to adjust once you figure it out (not an intuitive design I will say - but a quick google solved this).  I will say this is a large watch, not dainty - don't think I would want to sleep with this on (which is a shame since it can track sleep). Wish there was a smaller/lighter womens version.The screen is really bright and clear, arguably clearer than my several year old iPhone. If you don't like touchscreens or have issues with them, there are some buttons on the side that control some of the functionality which is nice so you're not totally reliant on the touchscreen.Also - can't believe this is water proof. It looks way to fancy to take anywhere near the pool or the beach, but I still love that feature for accidentally hopping in the shower (or being pushed into a pool?) The speaker is also surprisingly loud and clear - I don't jog willingly, but I imagine being able to control music from your wrist is convenient.Overall - if you want primarily a fitness tracker, this is overkill. If you want a beautiful watch that can also do 75% of what your smartphone can do, go for it!",
            "Like other buyers, I found the watch got scratched up quickly - after less than a week of normal wear. Also, despite deleting apps and changing settings, the watch would not stop doing background heart rate checks, so my battery would last about half a day. Sending it back. Very disappointed, as I liked the GPS for tracking outdoor exercise and syncing with Google Fit as well as the NFC payments with Google Pay. But this technology is not yet what it needs to be.",
            "I'll try to attach as many photos as I can, but I wanted to start by saying that I've been reading countless reviews about the Fossil Gen 5's for literal weeks now via Amazon and Fossil's website, and the most frequent issues I saw people write about were the speaker and the battery. I'm glad I caught the $199 sale- and that there were reviews about the recently improved updates concerning these two issues, because that is what pushed me to move forward with purchasing, and I couldn't be happier with that decision!!!Styling:First and foremost, the Gen 5 Julianna is STYLISH! I love the mesh band, which actually catches the light like a diamond would, giving off a glittery effect (still a learning curve on how to adjust it but YouTube came through,) and the rose gold face in contrast with the black body and band gives a nice balance between sleek and sporty. I did purchase a glass screen protector and applied that almost immediately, but it doesn't interfere with responsiveness or visibility at all (glad I bought it too because I accidentally dropped the watch like 30 mins after un-boxing it...) Not a scratch after dropping onto my wooden floors, to my relief! There are a variety of watchfaces via the phone and WearOs app, and I discovered last night that they are customizable as well! (See photos.) Just link your FB or IG to upload a pic and customize the colors for the font, etc., and then you can save it to the watch!Speaker:The speaker is perfect clear and the volume for ringtones, general media/calls etc. is adjustable. It also has \"do not disturb,\" \"Airplane Mode,\" and \"Theatre Mode\" features. I'm guessing the most recent update helped to improve the speaker clarity issue that many others complained about in the past; I currently have my volume at the halfway mark and it is certainly loud enough.Display:The display has an Automatic brightness setting and it does adjust for direct sunlight as well. As is the case with most phones, depending on exposure you may need to brighten it up using the \"Sunlight Boost\" in the display settings. I was at a food truck today just after noon with a cloudless sky and had no issues seeing, especially with the added Boost.Battery:The notorious battery issue. What I discovered rather quickly was that the battery will indeed wear down rapidly during the first few hours of use  unless it is fully charged, and will continue to do so if you have every single feature running all day. I HIGHLY recommend looking at the Battery settings on the watch itself, since there are different performance modes to choose from (heavy daily use with everything running constantly, semi-reduced use, a custom use mode (which is what I chose,) and a literal \"Time Only\" mode, which states it can power the watch for weeks. My specific recommendations to conserving battery: adjust the heart rate monitoring so it isn't checking every single minute unless you're actively working out (mine is every 30 mins,) disable some of your notifications via the WearOs app from any phone apps you don't need to be aware of urgently (like Insta, Audible, Google Drive, any games, etc.,) limit the movement \"Gestures\" to only one mode of your choosing (I'm only doing tap to wake since I'm moving my hands constantly all day,) turn on NFC only when at checkout, connect to your WiFi, and choose a watchface without a secondhand. With doing all of these things, I have been able to use my watch, while still checking it and playing with it throughout the day today, without needing to charge it once. I took it off of the charger around 0800 this morning on my way to work, and as of now (19:22-ish,) I have 52% battery life. That includes texting throughout the day, setting reminders, and organizing my apps. If you're having issues, I'd recommend checking out the WearOs app to see what is eating up your battery the most; it will list the functions in order from most-usage to the least usage. (See screenshot for reference.)Final thoughts/misc. info:The only other thing I can think of right now is that it will charge very quickly if you lay it down onto the charger (as opposed to charging the watch while on it's side.) The face is not humongous on my skinny wrist, and the watch is noticeable but not heavy by any means. Oh! There is also an app you can download called Noonlight which I recommend; you can set it up to have 911 or whoever sent to your location if you're feeling like you're in danger by either setting a timer that you have to disable at any time limit that you choose and if you don't disable by that time then they call to check on you/send help, OR, you can just go straight to \"Trigger Alarm\" and it starts then.Also, steps and heart rate also feel pretty accurate in comparison with previous my data from my Fitbit, there are easily loggable workouts and a nice breathing exercise integrated as well.Overall I think the Gen 5 made for a great birthday gift to myself and as a self-proclaimed \"tech-junkie\" I have absolutely no regrets!! If you're on the fence, add it to the cart and go live your best (and most convenient) life!!",
            "I have had 1 other fossil smartwatch that I used for some time and then got rid of it (I ordered a men's watch on accident and it was HEAVY). I have had the Samsung galaxy watch for the past year, and didn't like that it wasn't fully customizable and ill explain. You cant customize the galaxy watch with a picture AND your steps or stats. I believe you can with 3rd party apps, but I could never figure them out. With fossil smart watches you can! I chose this watch because it was Gen 5 and as close to all black as I could get with the Gen 5 watches. It is perfect! Screen is big enough to easily see what is going on, and it doesn't feel heavy. Halfway through the day I am at 76% battery left, and I typically charge my watches every night. 4 stars for battery life because the galaxy watch I can go 2 full days on 1 charge. Still a 5 star watch in my eyes because it is literally a smart watch. More is done from the watch than the Google OS app. Fossil wins vs. Samsung in my book.",
            "This watch has been great so far. Bought light pink one for myself and black one for my boyfriend and we love it. I love the fitness features, all the apps and the breath app! It's lightweight. Once I figured everything out I was hooked. Had a little bit of a learning curve coming from the Gear S2 but this still a big improvement because it's lighter and smarter however the battery doesn't last as long. I bought an extra charger for work, it is necessary to get a second charger. I have to charge it daily and sometimes more if I plan to track workouts or sleep track with it but with two chargers it is manageable. Eventually I'll probably get a second watch so I can alternate if money permits. I mostly use it as a timer and to see notifications from my phone. It's good because I can go about my day without constantly needing my phone. It's really good to have at work so I can stay focused. I prefer the black waterproof watchband that I gave my bf to the light pink suede like one I got for myself. That one's easier to clean, you can keep it on when you wash your hands and will last and look good for a lot longer.As for the pale pink one, noticed after one week it's starting to take on some dark tinge on the edges, even though I've been careful to remove it when watching my hands and face.My last watch was not waterproof but had a silicone wrist band so I'm used to being careful but not needing to be overly careful, I was able to keep on even when washing my hands. Only took it off to shower or wash my face.I will have to buy another watch band and only use the light pink on sparingly or on special occasions. I was able to clean it with a damp sponge, mixed a little laundry detergent with water and patted then patted dry, which cleaned it, but I noticed some ripples as if the glue underneath was not happy about getting wet, even just a little damp. Once it dried I was able to hold the ripples down and they went away. It did the trick but I wouldn't reccomend doing that often.I want to live my life and not worry about my watch every second so I'm buying an alternative band right away.Other than that it's a good watch, looks elegant and sleek. I've found some bands on Amazon that look good.",
            "I purchased this watch based on the style and reviews and was surprised by my experience with the watch. I was unable to open or see text on the watch. It would say I had a notification and when I went to open it the notification would clear. The battery life is TERRIBLE!! I took it off the charger at 100% at 8:00am, by 10:15am the watch was completely dead and powered off. I then charged it again, took it off the charger at 100% and within 1 minute battery life had died down to 96% and I wasn't even using it! I've adjusted all the settings and brightness but nothing worked. Possibly mine was defected and it really is a good watch but I won't waste my time or money purchasing a new one.",
            "Overall this watch is fantastic. I've been wearing for about 3 months now. Here are my major things.Battery life: it gets better as time goes on! I read some reviews about terrible battery life, and when I first used it out if package, that was true. For the first week or two, it drained quickly (sometimes within hours) from updates and such. Now I can wear it all day long and end the day at about 25-45%. This is with bluetooth on, NFC on, always-on-display, plus with gestures turned on. Things that can kill the battery: if I'm getting nonstop texts (like a group chat) or if I'm flipping my wrist a lot accidentally (since I have gestures on). I typically will just turn on do not disturb mode on my watch if too many texts or will lock the screen if I'm repeatedly flipping my wrist (or could turn off gestures).Convenience: simply having the time on my wrist has been more convenient than imaginable. On top of that, being able to quickly see (or respond to) a text is amazing. I used to pull out my phone and click click click...swipe...type...click- and go through that whole rigmarole. Not anymore! I also have my quick button set for a timer which I use daily and have weather displayed right on the watch face. It's all right there without fussing with my phone and it's wonderful.Design: it's gorgeous. I was scared it would look too large on my *tiny* wrist, but the round face makes it not too in-your-face. I bought a little screen protector which has been great and the metal has been surprisingly tough. I do occassionally knock it against things and so far, no real damage. The metal mesh band is by far my favorite. It's easy to get on and off. I bought a regular watch band type strap but it doesn't fit near as well as the mesh.Drawbacks: I sometimes wish I could use the phone app to adjust any of the settings of the watch, but it's limited to a very select few which can be annoying to fiddle with on the watch's small screen.My biggest catch so far, I can't make or answer calls on my watch like I was sure that I could. It was one of the reasons I had purchased this watch in particular to begin with. When a call comes in, if I hit answer on my watch, it says to continue call on my phone. Trying to get that figured out still!Overall, it's been a huge improvement in convenience and efficiency for me.",
            "After using only Fitbit products since 2014, I was impressed by how smart this watch is.  It has a lot of great features and while figuring how to use it at first wasn't always intuitive, I am overall pleased with my purchase.It is large and heavy but I got used to it quickly.  I didn't like the band so I quickly replaced it with a third party band that is easier to put on/take off and prettier.The reason why I can't rate it 5 stars is the battery life, oh my god, it's so bad.  I knew when I ordered that if I had all features enabled I would need to charge it daily, I was prepared for that but in real life I found myself having to charge it twice a day, which is too much if I am out and about all day.  I do like that it charges rather quickly and it goes from 12% to 100% in less than 2 hours.I tweaked settings to conserve battery such as changing the watch face, having it turned off unless I specifically press the button, turning off NFC, not playing music, and no longer using it for phone conversations.  Now I am able to get away with charging it once a day but I feel like I don't use it as much in general because so many features were disabled for battery-saving purposes.I like the variety of apps that are available, I didn't like that I had to install apps to do things I feel I should have been able to do out of the box.For the most part, I like the watch, I just wish I could do more with it without being a slave to its battery needs.",
            "Beautiful and well made Wear OS watch.  Getting a full day of battery with heavy use. The only problem is a known issue.  The watch is advertised to make and receive calls but there is a software glitch in all of the Gen5 Fossil watches that makes the audio impossible to hear during a call.  Fossil claims a software release will fix it in September.  We will see.  I am considering returning it and hope I still can if the software doesn't fix it.-Update- There has been no update and my window to return is up, so back it goes.  I really wanted to love it and for the most part, the watch was excellent.",
            "Let me start by saying I love this watch. This was my first, real smartwatch purchase. I wanted something stylish that was also functional and could be worn dressed up or down. I love the apps that are offered through it and i have weather, heart rate and fitness tracking, timer and other great tiles added to my short cuts. I like that i can review texts and emails, reply to them and even use emojis. I do enjoy the music control function as i stream often through my phone while i work out, and i can skip tracks easily through the watch without having to stop and pick up my phone. I dont wear it in the shower but i do wash dishes with it on, I bathe my kids and my dog with it and have sweated so much that it was wet underneath. It's not perfect, but definitely worth the investment. Ive had it almost a month and will update if anything changes.Pros:Heart rate tracker accuracyAdjustable band that was includedLarge face but not too heavyWatch band breathesWaterproof!Cons:Doing anything which requires flexing my hand back (think:doing a push up) makes the google voice activate.Touch is sometimes non responsive or too responsive (this is probably user error)Does not have TIDAL, only spotify app. Boo",
            "I wanted to love this.  I have worn a Fitbit Alta for a couple years and wanted to update to a smart watch.  I loved the look of this, but honestly, that was about all I did like.As a Fitbit user, I had gotten used to a lot of fitness features, including accurate step count, heart rate and sleep tracking.  This watch uses Wear OS and Google Fit, which are sorely lacking.  There is no in app sleep tracking,  and user forums directed me to a 3rd party app that requires you to have your phone in bed with you.  No thank you.  Google Fit seems pretty accurate with step count, but I couldn't tell if it was using my phone or the watch to track them (I still have the app on my phone,  and it tracked my steps today without the watch on).  The heart rate seemed accurate, but it only checks it every 10 minutes or so.It seems to be a nice watch, and Google Assistant was handy to respond to texts or look something up.  Maybe now that Google is buying Fitbit,  I'll try it again later, but as it stands, I returned this watch.",
            "I really enjoy this watch however if you run all the apps off of it your battery on it is going to drain really quickly so I run it as minimally as possible and I still have battery life like 80% even with the extended battery stay on it. I ended up having to buy new watch bands for it because I don't think the band on it is as stable as it could be but I do like it. So I ended up going with the Barton Buckle watch and feels more secure on my wrist and I like that. I think the app could use a little more work though because it seems to pick up most of the work out stuff off of Google fit so you kind of need to 2 apps in-away. Another thing with the watch is that the face is pretty big so if you don't like big face watches that kind of cover your wrist on the top  then I wouldn't recommend it. But other than that I'm pretty happy with the watch, and I would recommend it. Plus this is coming from somebody who uses $30 smart watches it's nice to have a good one on hand too.",
            "We were so excited about these watches when we ordered them. I ordered one for myself and one for my wife. I got this one for my wife, I ordered the Carlyle for myself. Hers never even turned on. Never. It was a paperweight. A $315 paperweight.Fossil.. this watch is a joke!\"Send it back and get a new one\"No thanks, I gave you a chance to be great and you were the complete opposite of it.See ya never! Buy something else.. these watches are dreadful!",
            "Dislikes: runs through battery quickly, if I plan on doing any physical activity for a couple hours I have to put it on the battery saver mode, which essentially just turns it into a watch.The buttons on the left side of the face are too sensitive/too easily compressed.  Every time I so a plank, push up, or really any exercise that involves extending the wrist, it pushes I'm the button(s) popping up different screens.  So far it seems to continue to track my workout and not pause it, but it's annoying.When I got a new phone I had to reprogram my watch.Likes: counts my steps even if I forget to wear it based on my phone app (assuming I have my phone)Lots of options for apps, I love Google pay, it minimizes the amount of items I need to take into a store (assuming the accept Google pay).Big clear screenYou can set it up to notify you of alarms, calls, texts ECT...It has a flashlight app",
            "I really wanted to love and keep this Fossil Juliana watch. I was so anxious to receive it, but unfortunately as other reviewers mentioned the speaker sound on incoming calls was really bad. I understand that Fossil is aware of the issue. I made this purchase this to make and receive call via my watch. But without being able to understand the caller, it us useless to me. I really loved the Google OS as well as many if the apps on this watch. So I ordered the Samsung Active Watch 2. I am waiting to receive it and expect better results.",
            "4 stars because the first shipment I got was a watch and a charger literally thrown into a box with someone else\u2019s information still inside of it. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a brand new one within two days. I did not contact the manufacturer directly. Now I\u2019ve got it up and working but the only thing is it won\u2019t stay connected if I close the Wear OS app on my iPhone 12. It\u2019s making me keep the page open to keep it connected even though I have background refresh on. I\u2019ve had to charge it three times since this morning from setting it up getting all the apps and personalizations. Since putting it on the battery has seemed OK though.",
            "I ordered this in Rose Gold. Before I even opened the box I had a missing faux diamond. I am debating on returning or exchanging but am worried they will continue to fall off. Has anyone had this issue? It's also more Gold to me then my previous Michael Khors Bradshaw. My Bradshaw after only a few uses has horrible tarnishing all over (it's still under factory warranty) but of course this is not covered. I will be sending it in for repair and getting an estimate but knowing fossil makes both these items I'm highly skeptical of the quality of their products. I loved my Bradshaw but the quick deterioration after only a handful of wears is disappointing. Not sure if I will return or exchange current product, I am unsure if they faux diamonds will continue to fall out and if it's covered. I'll add pictures of both items.",
            "I have had the watch 4 days now, and already the middle button is not working.  I had to jump through hoops to have it track my sleep.  There isn't a native app that sleep tracks.  You need to download \"Sleep as Android\".  Seems to work ok... except today, the middle button stopped working, so I have not access to any of my apps on the phone.  Nothing on line to help, so it's a useless POS right now.  Probably want to return it, unless Fossil has good customer service.  The seller on Amazon doesn't deal with warrantee issues.  Quite perturbed right now.  DONT BUY THIS WATCH!",

I bought this watch because it has google wear OS and it would provide all of the features I'm currently missing.  Problem is, it gets very warm and it was uncomfortable against my skin.  I called Fossil thinking it was a malfunction and they said that was normal.  So I returned it.",
            "I think I spent 9 weeks trying to figure out which watch to get, which meant reading a lot of reviews. So I figured I'd leave one to help anyone in my position trying to find the right watch.Going from a Fitbit to this, the battery life is really different, but I'm basically wearing a cell phone on my wrist, so I can justify having a full charge for the day and then just charging it at night or the next morning. It does charge quick!I had heard the calling feature wasn't great,  so I tried it first thing and it definitely needs improvements, but I didn't get the watch to be able to make calls, so I'm ok with not using this feature.It does take some time to get used to the texting feature, but the talk to text feature helps.I do wish there were more apps, but overall the watch is great! I can decline calls from my watch, see notifications, track workouts, control Spotify or whatever show I'm casting to my TV.",
            "I have been looking at smart watches for almost a year and finally found everything I was looking for. Affordable, great design, and all of the functions I wanted. The only things I would improve is the battery life and the number of minimalist face options. The week long battery life advertised is for just the watch function. Realistically I have to charge it every other day if I use to it's full capability without the screen waking up every time I look at it. It does charge in about an hour so charging it every other day isn't a deal breaker. Overall it's just as good as an apple watch but without the flagship price and looks way better.",
            "This is difficult- The watch was a gift for a special birthday.  I ordered a new Fossil Jullianna.  What arrived was NOT new.  In addition to the package NOT having the charger for the watch, there were several other indications this was not a new watch.  When we did find a charger from someone who had a similar watch, we realized this was not going to pair UNTIL WE DID A FULL FACTORY RESET on the \"new\" watch.When I called Amazon, they (finally) agreed to send a replacement after my complaint that the required charger was missing.The replacement watch came; Fully factory sealed in plastic wrap (this was not on the first watch sent) and the charger WAS included.Being sent a used/refurb (whatever) watch the first time begs a question- could this have been returned with malware loaded?  Could this have compromised security on ALL the phones apps?Although the watch itself is great- this was not a good experience- BE AWARE",
            "Overall, I love the design and look of the watch. It\u2019s a stunning piece with a mesh band that hasn\u2019t caused any skin rash like the FitBit bands usually do. The organization structure is nice and the watch apps are easy to find. I really dislike the Wear OS app that is required to setup the watch. It took me over 2 hours to get my watch setup and I had to force a factory reset after it was stuck on time only mode. The Bluetooth keeps constantly disconnecting which I never had that issue with Fitbit or Apple Watches. Also the battery life is awful so I had to switch watch faces and make other changes to conserve battery life. It defeats the purpose of having all these different cool watch faces if I have to recharge twice a day if I use them. I\u2019ll likely switch back to an Apple Watch but this one is an ok watch to use for now.",
            "Absolutely love this watch! I have been looking at this specific one for months but couldn't bring myself to spend so much. I saw that Amazon had a section of used ones being sold so I checked that out, and found one that said used-very good condition, packing was just damaged, and when it came in, everything was like brand new, even had the film still on the screen! The watch works beautifully once the software update is done, and the battery lasts me two full days with the touch to wake setting. I have had an apple watch before, and this matches it's function and far surpasses it in looks!",
            "Had this watch for just a few hours and returned it. Google wear OS is the worst! I bought this watch since I have a Pixel 3. Watch crashed on me 4 times, software update took 4 hours and close to 90%, it stopped with just a warning saying it could not be completed, then google assistant stopped working with some error, after talking to Fossil Tech and Amazon rep, I decided to return it. Bought Galaxy Watch Active 2 and couldn't be happier.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0Great update!!! I previously had the Gear S2 which came out some time ago in 2016. So yeah.....from 2016 to 2021 a huge time gap and update!!!! I preserve my battery life due to the previous watch not having a decent time of usage. So I have it on custom mode most of the time. AND.....i update my watch band and swapped it out for a alternate that i purchased on the Etsy app for 60$. Which I'm loving the new look!!! I'm all smiles\ud83e\udd70.",
            "I really wanted to love this watch. It is absolutely beautiful, but the functionality just isn't there. I went from full charge to 50% battery in a matter of hours just by reading a few text messages throughout the day. WearOS has known issues and this watch is no exception. Not sure if the hardware on this device makes it worse? I knew \"OK Google\" commands were unlikely to work, but even toggling the microphone manually and starting to speak yielded mixed results - usually just a blank, non-responsive screen. The heart rate monitor seemed accurate and I love the watch face options... other than that, the watch is inconsistent and doesn't get enough right to justify the multiple issues.",
            "I absolutely loved my Fossil watch. I had it for almost a year. It met all my expectations, allowed me to track my fitness and also find my phone when I misplaced it. While at work, I could quickly respond to text messages via the interfacing without pulling out my phone.However, I have had issues with the sleep tracking on my watch for a few months. I attempted to restart and reconnect the watch to my phone. The sleep would be tracked on my watch; although, would not sync to the Wear OS App connected with Google.This was just the first problem though.The latch on the mesh wrist watch became loose, causing my watch to fall off. I have attempted to contact Fossil on multiple occasions to gain information regarding the warranty process. While they have been kind on the phone the information regarding sending in my watch has not been given to me. I am still with a broken watch and miss utilizing the capabilities daily...I am disappointed with Fossil and their costumer care. If you are looking for a great watch, this is it; however, know that if there are any problems Fossil does not help! Eek!",
            "Pros:I love the look of the watch. Feels expensive and looks very stylish.When it operates correctly: I like the smoothness of switching screens.Cons:VERY SLOW!Lags and will freeze. Constantly have to restart.Battery is AWFUL! I really mean that. I had read it in previous reviews and decided to give it a chance anyways since it was on sale for $135. I'm so sorry to anyone who paid full price and kept it. I had to charge at all times for custom use. It was not set to always on but I did have most features on.You could talk yourself into buying it and just not using the majority of features available but then why buy a smartwatch? With time only mode it would save battery I'm sure but why pay so much for that?While the watch is beautiful it's worthless due to the awful battery and laggy/slow operating system.",
            "No one's fossil gen 5:Mine: Literally can't last through a movie.Received the watch today,then set it up following instruction including system auto-updating to latest verison,using default mode and default watch face,charged it into 100%then took an Uber to an AMC for a movie.Then this piece of trash totally died in the middle of the movie.I could have a nice sex much longer than this toy watch's battery hour,and Fossil you are telling me this toy is able to track my 'sport movement'?????By what? the embarrassing battery?",
            "I love this watch. I just got it a few days ago and it was super easy and quick to set up. I have an android and it paired perfectly. It is a little big on my wrist and a little heavy but I never wear watches so that could just be me. The battery life isn't the best but it is pretty good for having an always on display.",
            "I got this because everyone in my family has a iPhone and got Apple watches but I have a pixel 3. Let me just say I personally think this is better than the apple watch 3 and 5!!! It works great, half the price and can work with all my Google stuff. I love it. The only complaint is the band, buy a new band right away this one pinches and pulls your hairs! It's very hard to get on and off too.",
            "Nice size watch for petite wrist.  Do not like watch band and no matter what I do, battery has to be charged during the day.Update:. Changes 4 start to 5 star. There are 3 battery settings. Changed  setting to custom instead of daily.  Battery last all day.",
            "Just got my watch today!Watched tons of reviews before getting it, and was informed beforehand of it's good software capabilities.Did not expect the HARDWARE to be scratched.It might not seem like much, but I've been (for lack of a better term) scammed through amazon while buying a Littmann.Edit:This is the second time I've bought thisI use this watch 2 times per week max (when going for a long walk)It's RUSTING",
            "Best watch I\u2019ve owned yet. Battery, at first, didn\u2019t last long because I was using the watch like we all use anything NEW...  I couldn\u2019t stop playing on it. But once I got the hang of the apps and setup the watch to how I want it, the battery life was a day n a half before needing a charge. So for those who says the battery life suck, stop playing with your watch as much and you will see that it will last over a day before you need to charge it. After all, it is just a WATCH! It\u2019s not as big as your phone with the battery life of it. I love this smart watch.",
            "The main problem is the OS.  Sleep tracking? The battery doesn't last long enough for me to wear it to bed and also wake up in the morning and wear it all day. Wear OS is quite a bit behind when it comes to Apple. I'm an Android user and felt disappointed. Especially for the price point.It does what I absolutely need. Work out tracking and easy access to time, weather, date, and grocery list. But I have had it for months and never worn it to sleep because the battery is almost dead by then. It's a glorified watch. Maybe a mildly intelligent watch.",
            "This is a pretty watch, and if the smart part is important to you but not the fitness part, then it could be great for you.  I mainly wanted a fitness watch that looks prettier than my old garmin did.  This watch is pretty heavy, so it wouldn't stay in place when exercising, even when I wore it really tight. Once you add some sweat it will slide and flop all over. Very annoying.  Also, the step counter and calories counter are totally inconsistent and do not come anywhere near matching up to other heart rate monitors / trackers. I returned mine and went back to garmin.",
            "The only reason this watch is getting one star is because the design of the watch is beautiful. I returned this the day it was delivered. I could not receive calls on the watch, open any apps, or see my texts but my biggest problem was how terribly laggy it was in response to touch. I was very disappointed as this has the Google system and I have a Google phone. I was hoping for a good watch, but this was not it.",
            "Love the watch, it's super convenient. I didn't like the band it came with, it was metal and scratchy. The bands are super easy to change though and I got a silicone one. The battery could probably last a couple days, but I charge it every night. I would definitely recommend to Android users, it works really well with my pixel 3xl",
            "I just got this watch last week. So far, I am loving it. I switched from using a Fitbit watch to this. And I am so happy. I am a Google user so having the Google Assistant as part of this OS has been a much better experience than the other guy on the Fitbit. I would totally recommend this watch.I am a little disappointed that I could not connect to the fossil app. The wear OS app it's okay but seems to be lacking some of the features I could almost see in the fossil app. So, this should not be a deal-breaker.",
            "So, I purchased this watch in January 2021 and I purchased a screen protector. I dropped the watch from a height of three feet in February 2021. The screen (crystal) cracked. The screen protector kept the glass together, but eventually the crystal became shattered. I called many local watch shops, all stated that Fossil has a lockdown on their crystals and you have to service it through them. How much you might wonder, $150 to replace the crystal through Fossil's service department. Sigh. What a waste of money.",
            "I had to send it back because the metal mesh wrist band was stuck and would not adjust, Im looking forward to a different model that has a black silicone band. I will update my review as things unfold. the communication from the returns department was lacking,  confusing and a false communication from them left me reeling, still waiting an email acknowledging they're mistake. Also, there were no instructions regarding the band and no online support on fossil.com regarding the band.",
            "I love the look of the watch and feel of it. It was comfortable to wear and i have small wrists. It just didn't do what i wanted and the added apps didn't work that great either. I also bought it to use the speaker option and calls on it are impossible to hear. I bought the Galaxy active 2 and it's just better in my opinion.Also, i forgot that the other reason i couldn't wear it was because it started to irritate my skin under the face/ not the band. I'm thinking from nickel in the charging rings?",
            "I bought a 50$ watch and it stayed charged for a week but you couldn't do have the stuff this watch does. I customized the battery life so it can last a full day without dying and it works great. I got this watch on sale for $100 with 2 watch bands. I use the metal one more than the sport one. I use Google pay, make phone calls, and control my music all by my watch.",
            "This is by far the prettiest smartwatch I've ever owned. It doesn't have that unisex look of Fitbits, instead looking stylish, while still providing the stats. A big step up from the Fossil hybrid I tried, too, although that one is also very pretty. I wish it had better battery life. Can't answer for the sleep tracking because that's when I charge the watch. Love the magnetic charger, too. Great buy! Thanks, Fossil!",
            "Really like this watch. It comes with a great band and a lot of watch faces. I used to have an apple watch and I was a little worried about making the switch to Google with a new Android phone, but I'm loving it. Battery life is actually better with the fossil, larger screen, and brighter colors. Also can I just say I love the fast charge on this watch, in one hour it's back to 100%. Can't do that with apple lol.",
            "Bought this for my wife as a bday gift.  She loved it.Got the rose gold bezel with black band.Loves all the feature. It has Wear Os.Especially that she can read and reply to texts right from her watch.Answer and receive calls right fun her watch as well.Bought the Bluetooth version and I explained the differences to her and she is happy with her Bluetooth version.It has it's limits because watch has to be in Bluetooth range for features like text notifications and calls to work.Not a huge problem since she always had her phone nearby.Drawback with LTE version is it might not be compatible with your carrier. Extra cost to carry on certain plans that it does work with.",
            "I purchased this watch to motivate myself to be more active and become more aware of my stats. As this is my first smartwatch, I was not sure what to expect but soon came to love it. There are however, two downsides to this watch. One, you have to charge every night and I personally wanted to track my sleeping pattern so this has proven to be simpler said than done. And second, adjusting the band to a smaller wrist proved to be problematic. There are no instructions or manual included with the smartwatch so I had to resort to youtube. Reading the comments in the video proved that I was not the only one struggling to adjust the band. Hopefully Fossil fixes this in future models...",
            "I tried many smartwatches, looking out for size. The 40mm Samsung fit well but the face wasn't big enough. This watch is 44mm but is incredibly slim with a great beveled edge. The display is so clear and tough. The metal band dresses it up beautifully. The face doesn't bulge off my small wrist at all. The speaker is clear and the mic works well. The battery life sucks but it's a smartwatch. So that didn't bother me too much.Unfortunately I have to return it because of Wear OS. It keeps disconnecting from my phone (a Galaxy A50, so not old) and Assistant doesn't do texting at all. There are bugs that Google will get around to fixing at? some point? Such a bummer. If your Android phone happens to work with it, congrats. Ugh. I have to go back to Samsung and their stable Tizen.",
            "I can't give a very fair review on the battery life or touch screen. The watch would not connect to my phone. I've connected many other devices to this phone and others and have had no issues. This watch would become stuck on the install screen. The phone said it was there; the watch never did. After resetting it multiple times and spending 4+ hours on it, it is time to return it. My first experience with the Fossil brand will likely be my last.",
            "It's a beautiful watch and I received a lot of compliments on it.However, my screen went black and wouldn't turn on after I had it for just short of 6 weeks. I called Fossil, but because I purchased from Amazon,  they wouldn't honor warranty when purchased from a 3rd party. I only had a 30 day refund/warranty from Amazon. Luckily, they gave me an 80% refund, at least.  It's very disappointing,  when you spend that kind of money for a watch.Also, battery life only lasted 1 day, depending on the amount of phone calls/texts I received.  Doesn't matter now, since it won't turn on, but thought I'd add in that, too.",
            "I love this watch so much. It looks great on my wrist. I like the fact that I get all notifications I need from my kids distance learning apps making easy no to miss a thing. I have an iPhone 11 and refused to get an Apple Watch because I like round shapes better on a Watch. It was challenging at first to find one that work well with iOS. It doesn\u2019t give you notifications of sms single text messages or iMessages but I mostly use WhatsApp anyway.",
            "First and foremost, I received the wrong watch. I ordered the Juilianna and received the Carlyle instead. After looking at it,Ive decided to keep it since it appears to be the same minus the rose gold rim detail. The issue I am having is with the battery life.I fully charged it and startex following prompts to get everything set up and 2 hours into it, completely went dead! Not able to hear or see connection when calling contacts. Will update as soon as I charge battery again and look more closely at a few things.",
            "This watch is super cute and has all the functions I was looking for (notifications, calls, heart rate, etc) the band it comes with isn't the most comfortable and the battery life isn't great. If you want to wear it all day definitely should put it in extended battery mode.",
            "I am a man and I got this watch. This is honestly just as fast as my phone but looks and feels great. The side notch is extremely smooth and better than touching the screen to scroll and navigate. The two additional buttons are customizable to open one app (first or third party) each. The screen is great to look at. It takes less than an hour to charge and then gets me through the entire work day (with always on mode ON and half brightness) and will get me home with ~50% battery left. I hope this watch will get future updates and support. I would highly recommend this watch to a friend and already have",
            "I found it difficult to set up the watch both on my wrist and using the app. I also thought the dial face had poor touch sensitivity (didn't respond to swiping). The watch is also quite heavy (about twice the weight of current Apple Watch)\u2013\u2013I tried to find the weight online before ordering and it wasn't listed anywhere, also not on Fossil's website. I am returning it.",
            "Watch is great & exactly what I wanted.  Only problem is there are no instructions on how to operate the watch.  I had to get people who have smart watches to set it up for me.  I don't use the features because I don't know how to.  I have tried to download or get instructions but have not been able to so far.  I will keep trying.  In the meantime, I love the looks and it keeps accurate time.",
            "Nice watch BUT the description should specify that you cannot send text from your watch when pairing with iPhone. Honestly not sure I would have spent the money if I had known that prior, since it\u2019s implied that it does.  Also disconnects more frequently than I\u2019d like and you still must be in range of your phone. Still very nice though and I\u2019m enjoying it for most part.",
            "This was a gift for my Gf for her recent birthday and she went absolutely crazy, bananas, and bonkers over this watch. It's exactly how Amazon show cased it in the pics!! Big 45mm watch, nice box, and all. I recommend it to a love one, friend, or whoever u wish!! It's an amazing watch for how advanced it is. Now she wants me to get matching one with her lol.. She loves this watch a lil more than me now But she deserved! A++ watch",
            "Like the style of the watch. Wish there was more that can be controlled from the app outside of just the watch face. Everything else is done from the watch which can be tiny.  Battery life is ok, gets me through the work day but is almost dead when home.",
            "It worked since November 29th.... its not Jan 9th and does not hold a charge any longer. I've gone through trouble shooting and nothing... Will have to raise ticket with Fossil themselves and have them repair...",
            "What I expected. I\u2019ve always wanted a fossil watch, I finally go one. Powered by google, easy to set up for iPhone & very manageable. It\u2019s super cute too!!",
            "Stopped working tried several times to troubleshoot got it working just to stop again 4 times. 17 days after returned within the timeframe I still don't have my refund.4/12/21I returned this item on 1/30/21 And I still do not have my refund of over $149!!!",
            "This watch is beautiful and exactly what I wanted. HOWEVER!!!! It is not compatible with iMessages. You cannot receive notifications on this watch if you use iMessages. I\u2019m so disappointed and annoyed that this is not in the description.",
            "This was purchased as a gift - first one the battery died after a month and wouldn't recharge.  After jumping through hoops Fossil sent a replacement - this time the battery lasted for about 3 months,  it is not working any longer.  I expect more quality from this brand but will not purchase any more smart watches.  I would not recommend this to anyone for this price I expect it to last.",
            "I love this watch. It's compatible with everything, the battery is on par with the newest Samsung watches, the size is perfect (big enough to be useful, small enough that you can still use your wrist), HR tracker is exceptional, display is responsive but not overly sensitive with default settings. It's also absolutely stunning.",
            "After having a week I've had to reset the watch 2 times now.  Face just went black wasn't charging it just died so had to go on line apparently this is an issue with this watch anyhow you have to do a hard reboot an then it comes back to life. Love the watch an it's functions plan on keeping it.  But be cautious",
            "The charging ring on the back pulls off after a couple months. Renders this $ 305 dollar watch useless. Conveniently after the return policy on amazon is over. Now we are sitting here with a $305 paper weight. Not even the best looking paper weight. Hold yourselves accountable Fossil.",
            "Fossil runs WearOS from Google. And, it seems to be quite awful.everything to do with this watch is just awful. Battery life is - sorry to repeat - awful.I wanted to like this because I like all things Android. But this one tested my patience to infinity and beyond!",
            "Love this watch with my Google Fi Pixel 3 XL. Does phone calling and text messaging with a google fi phone like the Pixel. Also fossil is a life changing company for me now. The craftsmanship a quality of the watch is breathtaking.",
            "Do NOT buy this watch. A lot of features work great, but others will not work at all. Like making/receiving calls through the watch or replying to texts on the watch. My wife spent hours talking to Fossil support and they told her \"it's a known issue that they're working on\". No fix. No timeline. No replacement or remedy. To be fair, the watch is terrific and my wife loves it. The issue is with Google's Wear OS, but it's a common, known issue with no fix. Don't get stuck with one of these.",
            "In my opinion this is the best looking smart watch.  Built in speaker! Lower profile compared to other brands.Great integration for your Android phone for messaging, emails, maps, navigation, etc.The display uses almost entire area inside bezel",
            "Great watch! Nice design and easy to use. I have it paired with a Pixel 4. Battery life works good in my opinion. I work long days and the battery life keeps up the entire day. Would definitely recommend.",
            "The battery life is really really bad! Use the tracker more than once and your battery is sucked dry.  There are even random days when I have to charge it mid morning and I have not done any tracking, but I did talk and text.  Sad sad sad.  It is almost impossible to see the screen outside too.  Other than those two things I like the watch.  Unfortunately I would not recommend this to a friend.",
            "Bought the watch for my wife. The apps and messenger functions work great.The battery life is crap. Have to charge it daily if not twice a day. The charger itself is already not working properly. Had it for only a month and the charger is hit or miss. For how expensive this watch is, we're rather disappointed.",
            "Este es mi primer Smartwatch y estoy muy feliz porque adem\u00e1s de ser muy bonito y funcional puedo cambiar su look con varias correas originales de Fossil, adem\u00e1s me mide mi pulso del coraz\u00f3n y con el app Wear OS me conecto a mi Iphone y le puedo cambir de dise\u00f1os del display. Me encanto",
            "El reloj es muy bueno, la bater\u00eda para m\u00ed uso normal me dur\u00f3 alrededor de 2 d\u00edas.  Solo ajuste las app para que no est\u00e9n consumiendo la bater\u00eda del reloj. A m\u00ed me gust\u00f3, por ahora. Ay que ver con el uso constante.",
            "This is my first ever smart watch. Now I wonder how I went so long with out it. It's got everything you could hope for in a smart watch. Im completely obsessed! Great purchase!",
            "Pros: looks nice, large screen, ease of typing, straightforward useCons: mesh wrist band is difficult to adjust, layout of features is confusing, larger screen leads to chunky feeling, battery life is horrendous, and it would not stay connected to my phone or wifi",
            "I absolutely love this watch! I've been wearing it for 2 days and still don't have to charge it. I was anxious about spending so much on a watch, but I'm really glad that I did.",
            "My wife, who never wears watches; loves this watch! The mesh band makes it look elegant and are very easy to change out. Definitely does everything she needs it to do. Currently getting a day and a half on single charge with minimal use.",
            "I really wanted to like this watch. It's very pretty. It's functions pretty well. I have an iPhone Xs Max and it paired seemlessly. I couldn't get Spotify to work in the short time I had it. But my biggest gripe was the step counter... In the morning, when I get ready, I don't really walk around that much but within an hour I supposedly already had 2000 some steps. The heart monitor was wonky too. Sadly I returned it within a week.",
            "So far so good! I've waited for them to start working out, Smart Watch kinks. As of now I enjoy tinkering around with it. The heart rate sensor seems to work well. Most apps do their basic notifications. You need to modify and configure, to your liking, for longer battery life. I'd recommend, and it's afforable in comparison to other's with its specs.",
            "I love the programable bottoms and custom battery options. Great set of faces available, and very easy to use for a first time smart watch wearer. With a custom set of power preferences I get 16-17 hours per charge with the face always on.",
            "This is a terrible smart watch. If you were to just use it for the watch feature it's brilliant, but after that it goes down hill fast. After I connected it to my phone it would disconnect then not reconnect so I'd have to unpair the two and start all over from the beginning. It comes with terrible instructions that barely tell you how to get the watch working. It's over constructed and underwhelming. The buttons only get it your way and constantly turn the watch on. It's hard to navigate on the watch and almost useless when you really want to use it.",
            "Okay... So this is my first smart watch... It does great staying connected to my phone... And it looks really nice. I've been wanting some kind of watch for awhile. My main complaint is that in bright sunlight you can't see the time. And honestly it is in no way more practical than pulling out your phone. When it breaks, I won't buy a new one. I don't NEED it for anything.",
            "I'm not very impressed. I wanted this watch to track my bike rides with strava but the battery life is really bad. If you like to exercise a lot (long bike ride or hike) don't bother with wear os. Also google got rid of google play music?? So how am I supposed to listen to music on this? Google also got rid of reps and set timers on strength training on Google Fit. Not to mention Google assistant doesn't work when I need it to.",
            "The watch looked nice and was in good condition. The battery life wasn't all that great. It's a decent smartwatch that requires you to plug it in once a day.",
            "Beautiful watch with so many extras than my Fitbit blaze. Love it so far! Syncs up fast to my iPhone XR and updates heart rate and everything else. Completely customizable!",
            "From a full charge, only a month old, it cannot last for more than a few hours. A watch this poor should simply not exist in the marketplace.I wrote Fossil to report this issue and attempt a replacement or refund; they acknowledged my email and then immediately closed the support ticket without any response to me. I will no longer be a Fossil customer... clearly not the same company from 10 years ago.",
            "The only reason I got this watch is because I had read the reviews about the battery life being great, unfortunately the first day I tried to use my watch it died within 4 hours of using it for replying some text messages. I returned the item the next day. If I want a watch that'll last me 4 hours I'll just keep my old one that lays me 6. Horrible battery life I don't recommend it.",
            "This watch was very nice looking. The first day I wore it it turned off and never turned back on. I returned it for a refund! Very disappointed since I loved the look of it.",
            "I LOVE the style of this watch, although I didn\u2019t realize how big The face actually is. I should have measured prior to purchase.The operating system did not meet my expectations. Slow, App Store seemed limited and the operating system was overall slow. Continually disconnected from my phone.",
            "Returned the item because the watch was way too big for my wrist - and most importantly, the watch doesnt even last for 10 hrs. The battery was the biggest down part...But giving 3 stars because the watch itself is beautiful and loved the strap.",
            "I wanted to get a smartwatch, and liked that this looked like a regular watch. It does what I hope it would - though google fit leaves a lot to be desired. I wish the battery life was longer, but at the same time, it means I take it off each night - which is good, because if when I didn't, I developed a rash under the watch base. So, it's ok.",
            "Love this watch ..it would have been great if it track my sleep then I would get rid of my fitbit... just wear my fitbit to bed just for tracking. ..and if the battery would last a little long so wouldn't have to charge it every night but I'm okay with that.",
            "It keeps disconnecting from my phone that's right beside me or in my pocket. Then it doesn't want to pair again, and keeps telling me to do a factory reset. Junk. And when I ask for a refund, I get the runaround.",
            "Pairing with my pixel phone was super easy. Delivery was on time. No problems or issues. Wear OS automatically updates once the battery is at \ud83d\udcaf.",
            "Don't waste your money.  The watch disconnects from my iPhone multiple times per day.  Also, the metal band it comes with is awful! It un-clips itself and the whole watch has fallen off my wrist at least 3 times.  I had to order a silicone watch band.  For what this watch costs I would expect a better product.  Very disappointed!",
            "Save your money. This was a true disappointment. The battery went from 100 to 0 in a matter of a few minutes some days. Didn't last an entire day ever. It disconnected from my phone quite too often. O received it for Christmas so can't send it back, but will NEVER purchase again.",

            "I love my smartwatch. It's very easy to use and I continue to find more things about it, if I keep playing around with it.Pros: Battery last like 36 hours, Can use message through Apps easily and listen to my mustCons: The wristband can get lose and fall off even when it's snapped in place correctly. The sound to handle phone calls is hard to hear",
            "I love my watch. I have it paired with my iPhone 8. I can\u2019t reply to text, but I can answer calls and talk on it. I don\u2019t wear it around the house, just at work and when I\u2019m out and about so I get 1.5 day\u2019s of battery life. It took almost a week of constant reconnecting/pairing which was ssoo annoying, but once the updates came through I have had zero issues!",
            "This watch operates slowly.  Doesn't keep accurate time",
            "I love this watch! It's unique and cool looking.  It's chunky and bulky,  but I like it like that.  It comes with neat faces,  way more than Apple.  You won't be disappointed!!",
            "Battery runs out extremely fast I can't even go 8 full hours before it has to go on time only mode.",
            "The appearance and features are nice, but you can't go hiking or biking and expect it to track your exercise even for half day, you will run out of battery before you complete your exercise.It is annoying to have to charge it twice a day.",
            "Large face makes it easy to access the apps and see the information, but if you have large fingers it might be a bit harder. The touch screen is great and navigation is really simple. I really love the fit of this watch. The watch band is so awesome!",
            "The only I would complain (but too much) is that I basically need to charge it every single day. Other than that, 5 stars",
            "Love the appearance of this watch. It's so user-friendly modern and colorful.  Love that in the screen i can even see whatssaps stickers and screenshots.. never thought about get a smart watch but simple love it.",
            "I love this watch, but my only complaint is that the watch band is too tight.",

            "I sent it back ONLY because for me it was more for a guy.",
            "Love this watch in design and function. Has so many features! Only wish didn't have to charge it nightly.",
            "I was really skeptical about buying this watch. However, I definitely do NOT regret it!! The battery lasts a 8-hour work day with an overall 12-hr day use without dying. I like that I can answer calls on it. It makes things a lot easier. Watch faces are pretty nice as well.**Water resistant aspect is true. Works in the shower",
            "This was my first smart watch purchase and so far I am extremely pleased. The battery life has been good, even with using my watch to control Spotify. It looks professional and the watch faces are beautiful. It connects easily through Bluetooth to my iPhone. I have not had any major problems with it so far.",

            "looks good and i bought and extra band (rose gold) and it looks amazing, really happy with the purchase,",
            "Really good deal buying it through the warehouse.  I couldn't find anything wrong with it or the box. I'm so happy with my purchase.  Thank you",

            "Looks great",
            "This watch is super stylish and comfortable. It is great with notifications and stays charged all day with use.

            "Like the watch still figuring out",
            "I love this watch. Many benefits and syncs very well with my galaxy S10. The band is adjustable, I workout with it, and sometimes I sleep with it on. It charges rapidly. The best feature is probably being able to have a conversation through my wat h while doing my hair or makeup.",
            "Overall I like this watch, I think it has a very nice look. The charge doesn't last the whole day though...even with battery saver turned on.",

            "===  My Take  ===The WearOS Fossil Gen5 Julianna smartwatch is a very competent and excellent smartwatch even when compared to smartwatches from other ecosystems, such as Tizen and WatchOS.  It's sporty and stylish, has excellent build materials and build quality, runs smooth and responsive, and offers numerous smart features and apps.  It took a LONG time for WearOS to mature into this but it's finally very good and desirable._____*Pros:-Sporty and clean design.-Good specs.-Even with Always-On Mode on, battery lasts a full day. \ud83d\udc4d-One of the four Battery Modes offer the ideal setting for most people.-Google Assistant is very responsive and recognizes my voice commands very well.-All three buttons are responsive.  The rotating crown is smooth.-Touchscreen sensitivity is great and swipe gestures work well.-Tons of watchfaces to choose from.-Wear OS is snappy and smooth overall.-Notifications show up promptly and they're easy to dismiss.-The included wristband is comfortable and offers great adjustability range.-Wristband can be easily replaced with other ones.-I can swim with these!  \ud83d\udc4f_____*Neutral:-Phone call quality is so-so.-Setting up Google Pay was a bit buggy and took a couple of tries.-Once in a while, there is some slight lag between swipes and taps._____*Cons:-Under direct light, can't see anything, even with Sunlight Boost.-Inside the WearOS phone app, there should be a launchpad for a strictly WearOS app store section.-Downloading apps on the watch is slow or it just fails sometimes.===  Background  ===I've been wearing a smartwatch daily since 2015 and I'm totally into them.  Besides for telling time, I now depend on my smartwatch for many things - quickly glancing at notifications, answering phone calls, sending short emoji's and text messages discreetly, using voice assistant shortcuts and functions, keeping track of my exercise & heart rate, and using helpful apps such as a timer, stopwatch, alarm clock, calculator, and media controller.  Many times it is just better and faster to do these things on a watch than on a big and bulky smartphone, such as my Samsung Galaxy S10+.Before the Fossil Gen5, I was using smartwatches running on the Tizen platform and purposely avoided WearOS watches due to their comparatively lackluster performance, poor battery life, inadequate hardware, and so-so reputation.  The Fossil Gen5 Julianna changed my perception and showed me how good WearOS can be with proper hardware.===  Design & Hardware  ===In terms of design and hardware, the Fossil Gen5 Julianna is wonderful.  It looks sleek and elegant in gold and black, the buttons are responsive and offer satisfying feedback, and the wristband is great-looking and comfortable with a secure fit.  I really appreciate having the option of swapping out to any 22mm band according to my personal taste.Its 1.28\" display is crisp and big enough and the 44mm case size looks proportionate on my wrist.  Bluetooth, Wifi, NFC, and GPS worked perfectly and I never experienced any connection issues.The speaker quality for playing notifications and ringtones was adequately loud and clear.  For voice calls, however, it was a bit lacking.  Besides skipping voices on my end, many people complained about call clarity so I stopped using the watch as a phone.  In a pinch it'll do but it's not good enough to replace a smartphone's mic or even a Bluetooth headset.The vibration motor is merely adequate.  I wish the intensity could go up a few notches from its current maximum.  As it is now, I wouldn't be able to be woken up from my nap.  For notifications and calls, though, it's fine.Going back to the display, its legibility under direct sunlight is horrible.  Regardless of which watchface I use, I can't read anything.  With my previous Tizen watch (Gear S3 Classic), I could at least make something out if I squinted & brought it closer to my face.  Not so with the Julianna.  I have to tap the screen or press the Home button first.  This was so even with the Sunlight Boost mode enabled.One of my favorite hardware features is its ability to be worn during swimming.  I go to the beach often and prefer to have my watch with me.  With my previous watch, I had to take it off because it wasn't swim-capable and it was vulnerable to sand jamming up the rotating bezel.  With the Jualianna, I don't have to worry about any of that.  Love it!  \ud83d\ude0dAnother feature that worked well was the NFC function for Google Pay.  Although I experienced a glitch during setup, it worked flawlessly after everything was set up and my credit card was enrolled.All in all, I'm satisfied with the design and hardware.===  WearOS Apps & Ecosystem  ===My watch is currently on WearOS version 2.8 with the July 1st, 2019 Android security patch applied (as of 2019-09-02).  For everything I do with the watch, my experience has been very satisfactory.  Taps and button presses are registered right away and there is no frustrating lag.  Swipe gestures work very well and all of my apps open and launch almost immediately.The WearOS smartphone app is clean and well-organized.  Through it, I can change my watchface, set \"My Tiles\" app shortcuts, activate the \"Always-on screen\" setting, check on the storage level, and take screenshots of the watch.  What I find lacking, though, is no direct access to a WearOS-only app store.  I know I can open up the Google Play Store app, click on \"Categories,\" scroll down to the end and tap on \"Wear OS by Google.\"  But it would've been nicer if I could view all the WearOS apps from the WearOS app in a neatly categorized and sorted fashion.  The Tizen competition does a much better job in this aspect.An immediately perceptible strength of WearOS over its competition are its almost instantaneous notification alerts and the awesome Google Assistant AI.  Notifications show up quickly with no lag behind the smartphone.  The Google AI does a fantastic job recognizing my voice commands and acting on them.  The results show up almost as quickly as on my phone and the assistant's voice sounds very natural and clear.With Google making slow but continual improvements, I see a bright future for WearOS.===  My Verdict  ===Besides the direct sunlight legibility and poor voice call speaker issues, I see no other glaring faults with the Fossil Gen5 Julianna.  It looks great, WearOS is snappy and performant, and the AI assistant works supremely well.  It's a well-engineered and quality product from Fossil.  \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4f",
            "While I still think they are a bit gimmicky. There are loads of uses, it also drops the use of a phone when just needing to take a quick glance and notifications! Moreover, this helps with monitoring exercise as well.The point is, you take a watch, which is the main point, and give it more life, including ability to pay, notifications, calendar alerts, it vibrates when your phone is ringing, it tracks your exercise patterns, and gives you quotes, which were surprisingly accurate for what was going on in my life.The screen on this is amazing though! It is crystal clear, even in sunlight, and the colors just pop. Reminds me of a OLED with how black the blacks look and how well it does with colors.The dock to charge this is unique. I expected something to plug into it when I first ordered it. But it turns out that it is a magnetically attached charger with two pins that connect to a ring that is on the underside. It's connects to a standard USB2.0 or 3.0 style, and charges with either a computer or even most usb charge adapters. (I honestly couldn't find one that didn't work.)It also charges quickly, however, as a caveat, you need to charge it daily. This may be related to some of the settings.You do need to download the wear os software on your phone. The first time I tried to pair it, it failed, stuck at a setup phase and wouldn't get off. After an hour I closed the program on the phone, where the phone was pretending to be connected, but wasn't. So I reset it in the settings, and started the setup again. Where it paired really quickly. Most of the time went to syncing profiles over to it though, which the wear os program on the phone walks you through what you would want the watch to do though.I do like this watch allot, and it can work on a male wrist of medium width at max wrist band settings.It has become a staple wear, and I have used it every day since I got it.",
            "I will review this product strictly from the perspective of having picked this up as a gift for my wife.  She is not the most tech-savvy, but can find her way around her phone and a Fitbit.  This seemed like a more stylish option than her fitbit and I thought she would enjoy the bigger screen for messaging and GPS and such.  I basically gave it to my wife and sat back to see how it went.  She seemed to be able to install the App and get the watch working fairly quickly.  First of all this is a beautiful device.  The screen seems much better and brighter than my Apple Watch.  The band was a huge hassle to figure out how to adjust.  I finally got it with a small screw driver to release the clasp.  Compared to the elegance of the Apple Watch band this was just a mess to deal with.  That alone took 15 minutes and there are no instructions for that.  After that my wife tried using it for a few days and finally just gave up.  She could not get it to deliver messages reliably from her iPhone.  She was unable to get the fitness apps working in a way that was useful to her.  She was able to customize her screen and it was very lovely, but that was about it.  I personally did not attempt to use the watch or fiddle around to see what else it could do, but for someone wanting a simple device to upgrade from Fitbit, this was not a very good gift.  I'm not sure what we'll do with it now, but she is clear that she does not want to continue using it.  That in itself speaks volumes.",
            "If it weren't for one key feature, this watch would seriously knock it out of the park.The screen is extremely responsive and I never have to worry about a stray swipe or a missed swipe making me want to pound the watch with frustration.Screen is immaculate, sharp, and auto brightness (although a little on the aggressive side towards dimness) works in stride.  It has the all of the key components that you can expect from WearOS, and its integration with Google functionality (including maps, wow) is great.Voice recognition for responding to texts is also superb and works even better than my phone which is just as well since I'd rather use the watch anyway!Watch faces are nice and wide-ranging in looks with many faces allowing up to 3, sometimes 4 customizable shortcut buttons in addition to being able to program shortcut to the hard buttons on the side of the watch.  Each one has an \"always on\" face that has low power consumption if you can't stand to not know what time it is without having to wake the watch.  \"Tilt to wake\" feature on the works very well without the \"wrist-shaking\" you may see from other watch users who are fighting the feature.While the built-in feature works GREAT for Google maps, answering questions from Google, etc., my watch cannot seem capable of being able to broadcast a phone conversation.  It supposedly has this feature, but I find the audio breaking up from a caller (reduced to gibberish - can't get a complete word out at all) and the caller can't hear me in turn.  This is odd considering how well everything else seems to work, especially with the voice-to-text required for text messages and \"Ok Google\" features.  I'm not sure WHY it doesn't work but all my tweaking has yielded me no successful results on both the phone and the watch.  This costs me a star...that said, I rarely want to broadcast my phone calls to an audience, so it's not a deal-killer for me, but if you're invested in it as a feature then I would suggest you look elsewhere.",
            "I don't know why they market this model as a women's version- it's definitely a unisex design, as the gold accent on the black watch is simple and classy. The size is no different from the versions marketed towards men, so I really don't get the designation of a women's watch.The Wear OS is new to me, I've been using a Garmin that I've been happy with but it's dated- I was looking for more modern features. Most of the more interesting features aren't rolled out for iPhone yet, unfortunately. I suppose that should be expected since Google Wear OS is obviously geared towards Android.Even with the limited functions, the processor is fast and the screen is extremely easy to read- which not a lot of smart watches can claim. I haven't yet tuned the battery for the best life for my application, but it tends to last quite a long time when used sparingly. Task it heavily with the fitness apps and it sucks the battery down very quickly.The band is nice, in that one can adjust it to exactly the size one wants- however the latches they use are a bit wonky. It took some trial and error to find just the right tightness for the sensors to work properly but not too tight. The infinite adjusting band is great in that sense, but I find the latch to be less than perfect.For Android users, I'd suggest giving this watch serious consideration- it's well made. For Apple users, check in with the Wear OS development to see where it stands at the time of your purchase.",
            "I (a bit of a Fossil myself) had to get help from a favorite a niece, a petite and stylish 1st year teacher, Smartphone user and I got these details:The Fossil Google Smartwatch has been a fun addition to my workout AND wardrobe! It is definitely more stylish than other sport smartwatches. It looks like a watch I would buy anyways, but with the Smartwatch features. The set up is really easy, you just download and app on your phone and do the rest of the set up from there. You can also learn about and use features on your phone, which I like because it\u2019s bigger and more broken down on the phone app. It\u2019s easy to find your fitness data on the watch face as well. The only downside is it did feel a little bulky when I went on a run with it on, and the clasp sometime fell open (not unclasped, just the top part would come open and I would just shut it). But just walking around day to day it is a great, nice looking Smartwatch!",
            "I have an iPhone and an Apple Watch Series 1.  I hate the looks of the Apple Watch, but love the functionality. It is pretty much the problem with any Apple product.  I ordered this watch hoping it would function well with the iPhone.  I also didn't realize it was marketed as a woman's watch.  Oh well.  It connected with the Wear OS app and was pretty simple to pair.It gave some notifications, but I was not able to make or receive phone calls on it.  I got text notifications but could not reply to them.  I also could not find the Text icon within the watch's menu.  I was extremely hopeful this watch would work the way I wanted it to.  But sadly it did not.  Hopefully Apple catches on and makes a watch that doesn't look like a miniature phone you wear on your wrist.",
            "Great smart watch. Runs off google, which is great. But the interface is a little slow. Pixel quality is amazing. Vibration is minimal. Can barley feel it when it vibrates. Looks nice. Would recommend.",
            "A useful watch for both health status and convenience.  I was looking for a device that provided sleep monitoring, built-in GPS for route tracking, sensors for pedometer and calories, and phone-like apps for notifications and comms.  This one has the heart-rate monitor, GPS hardware, motion sensors, and runs GearOS.  It has a full colour touch screen and runs a number of available apps, many of which pair with Android apps on the phone to relay notifications, messages, and calls.  There is a nice sleep app called Sleep as Android available.Spotify is integrated and the watch acts as a media controller for any other player on the phone as well.  You can even see images or slideshows from the phone.My only two concerns are the battery life and the band.  The watch needs charging at least once a day but has a nice magnetic charger that clips on the back in any orientation unlike similar products.  The band is not expandable to a wrist that changes during the day and I suspect the clasp might not last long.  Hopefully it will be replaceable.",
            "Came in as an opened box. It was cold weather and the watch surface is already wet.The reaction is very slow when you click on buttons or touch screen."

            "I'm not a touch screen high demand smart watch user. While this has smart watch functions it's not why I got it. For me it's tracking my health and a long battery life.For smart watch use I simply have it vibrate on my wrist and then I look at my phone. This means I don't have to have annoying beeps and ringing.The battery has lasted over two weeks with daily cycling (60min).Screen is easy to read. It hasn't got the glam of the top tier touch screens but it's always on and clear.The strap is comfortable. Wide enough to not need it tight for everyday use. Do it up a notch when you get physical.Took a few tries to get the compass right. But works well now. GPS is quick to connect. I use the Garmin chest strap when exercising. The pair work together nicely. The wrist sensor is ideal for everyday use.Consider what you need before you purchase. For fitness this is excellent with ease of use and long life, while providing good smarts. If it's glamour, messaging and reading emails you want then buy the watch that is good at that.",
            "I had a Garmin Vivoactive 3 that had been dearly loved, but was now down to about 24h of battery between charges, so bit the bullet and sprung for the Fenix and am disappointed I didn't do it earlier. Fantastic battery life (10-14 days, depending on what I'm doing) and plenty of additional smarts - some gimmicky, some less so.  The body battery is a good example.  Rather meaningless, but I do like it.  The screen is clear, customisable through the Garmin app store and resistant to scratches, even as the non-sapphire model.  The buttons are old-skool, but solid and far more reliable than the touchscreen of the older vivoactive, which used to go crazy when wet.The GPS locks quickly and the Connect app continues to improve. The only improvements I'd want are wireless charging and perhaps a touchscreen option.  I wouldn't trade the buttons for one, but there are times when both would be nice (eg touch is more intuitive for the smart watch features when not exercising).",
            "I love that oxygen was an added measurement & it's what made me finally splurge on getting a watch. Unfortunately this reading requires you to not be in motion so isn't taken during a work out. (the only time I wear the watch)I was also excited to see climbing was included because I was interested in how my measurements changed during a climbing season and how much it varied between bouldering and lead climbing. Unfortunately the pre programmed trackers for those activities require you to enter route information and click the start/stop before and after each individual route. Which I find massively disruptive. This as well as climbing grades been rather uninformative to track across every route/problem of a session. So I gave up on the watch while in the climbing gym.Great for running and swimming though.",
            "Experienced runners will likely find Garmin's training advice irritating. Garmin thinks that my marathon training is \"unproductive\"; however, they need to consider more than just VO2max.It only detects my sleep about once a week, despite me wearing it 24/7 (excluding recharge time).The temperature sensor is a joke, as it can't differentiate between body and air temperature.I've paired it with HRM-Pro in an attempt to use Running Power for pacing. Unfortunately Garmin Connect does not display it for splits correctly, forcing me to implement a work-around.The Garmin Forerunner which I owned over a decade ago was better.",
            "It was at least $100 cheaper than in store. Watch is great but we just can\u2019t managed to set up the pay on the watch. And it was the reason I paid for this model... so we r a bit frittered. As I could have gotten an older model that does the same things without pay...  our previous watch from Garmin was super fast and easy to set up pay...",
            "Product: I bought this Fenix 6 to replace my old Apple watch, which got broken whilst I was working in the yard.The Fenix is a quality bit of kit, although I think its pretty over-priced generally. The interface is quite clunky and not very user friendly. I would've been very disappointed had I bought it for full retail price, but represents good value at the price offered by Amazon. I do miss my Apple Watch, but its fragility and need for daily charging were deal-breakers for me, hence the switch to the Fenix 6. So far it's ok and serves its purpose, but nowhere near as elegantly as the Apple Watch.Retailer: The watch arrived quickly and exactly as advertised. And as mentioned above, the price is realistic. I'd recommend them.",
            "So far using this watch I am very impressed with the comfort on my small wrist and I wear it 24 hours a day.  The battery life is also good but yet to test it out on a 100km run.  Easy to use.  Probably a bit on the expensive side normally but I waited until it was on sale.",
            "Fenix 6 is a good step up from the 235 forerunner. More detail around sleep and exercise patterns incl aero and non aerobic training levels and loads. Amazon pricing below retailers.",

            "This is going to be a longer review, as i had issues finding the info i wanted on this watch. I wrote this for the tactix delta, but it also applies to the fenix. The smaller one is the fenix, the larger one with the better contrast screen is the tactix delta.The fenix 6X and tactix delta are exactly the same size, the only difference is the styling.I originally bought the Fenix 6 pro, which had a really bad purple screen/bad contrast when the backlight was on. I also found it a bit small for my tastes. These fenix and delta have the same \"internals\" and features. The tactix comes with some mostly irrelevant extras like night vision mode and stealth mode, which don't really do anything special for me.I bought the tactix delta for 2 reasons:1) I love the styling on it, much more so than the fenix 6X pro, this was a major deciding factor despite the price difference.2) THE SCREEN -- the fenix series is about 50/50 or worse depending on which one you buy to get the \"good\" screen or the purple one. If you look at my pictures, with the backlight on, the tactix is clearly superior. Now, for the fenix, if you want a sure bet to get a good screen, you have to buy the solar. If you buy the sapphire version, it's 50/50, if you buy the regular pro, you're most likely to get a 'bad' one. The tactix has a very high chance of getting the good screen.Once again, this is only noticeable with the backlight on, otherwise, the 2 screen look identical outdoors.Size difference:- i found the 6 pro a bit small and the bezel too pronounced, my wrist circumference is about 7.2 inches, which is average. I took a picture with both watches on my hand so you can get an idea.- I find the size clearly bigger, but i like it.- Weight wise, i can barely tell the difference.- I find the larger one to sit better on my wrist, the extra width means the strap sits more comfortably.Battery life:- going one size up, it's about an extra 50% battery life, which is a nice bonus- the 6 was lasting me about 7-10 days with about 4-5 hours of sports with gps + music in that time frame.- the bigger size is about 10-12 days for the same sort of use.- this can be improved if you turn off the spo2 measures during sleep and the wrist gesture for the backlight.Sapphire screen:- going sapphire makes the screen much more reflective, this does reduce visibility, and it can be a bit distracting. But i don't find it annoying enough to trade it for gorilla glass which is fairly scratchable.My experience with sapphire screens:I've had a Bering watch with a sapphire screen that's about 10 years old, so i knew what to expect. It's nearly impossible to scratch, in the 10 years i've had it still looks new with not as much as fine scratch, i believe only diamond can damage it and maybe sand.Other differences:- nothing else really, exactly the same as the fenix, same features.- i find the spo2 reading more accurate, as i said, this size sits better on my wrist so i feel the sensors have better contact as well.Which one should you buy?- If you like the look of the fenix series and dont care about screen, any will be great choice.- if you like the fenix series and absolutely want a good screen you have 2 choices:a) buy the solar for 100% guaranteeb) buy the sapphire but be ready for returns, which amazon might not likec) i believe garmin will accept a warranty claim on itSize wise, if you like bigger watches, 100% go for X or tactix delta. If you like smaller, go for the 6S, i'd only pick the regular 6 if you want the little bit of extra battery life.",
            "Ho letto e riletto le recensioni degli altri utenti che ritengo sempre molto importanti. Incredibile, veramente un orologio incredibile. Vengo da un Apple Watch, che \u00e8 un ottimo oggetto, che per\u00f2 ha una carenza pazzesca ... la batteria. Il Garmin Fenix 6, tenendo attaccato tutto quello che lo pu\u00f2 scaricare tranne il GPS che uso di rado per delle camminate, dura 5/6 giorni e si ricarica in un paio di ore. Per il resto, per uno sportivo principiante, come me \u00e8 eccezionale. Anche fuori dallo sport rimane un orologio utilissimo per il controllo di parametri vitali. Cio\u00e8, detta come deve essere detta, il top.",
            "After 1 week:I wanted a forerunner 945 but there was no reduction for black friday. The finix 6 was reduced considerably & has the same feature set so the decision was made. Overall it has surpassed expectations. I was not sure about wearing a monitor all the time, but this has changed my mind.Physically it is much nicer in person than in pictures. I wanted the 945 as i thought the fenix would be too big but its nicely proportioned. Its not in any way heavy, sits well on my wrist,  and does not get in the way.It looks good, kind of like a refined G-Shock.Ive cycled, ran and done some strength workouts with it and its comfortable for all, although care is needed during strength workouts not to forget about it and bump it aginst kettlebells/barbells/dumbbells etc. It feels like it would take abuse but i still dont want to test it.GPS is fantastically accurate, it tracks the road perfectly on the bike and during a run.Heart rate monitoring seems accurate. ive been comparing it to my Samsung health heart tracker and it usually matches perfectly, it is inaccurate however if the strap is too tight, but its easy to find the right point, as its exactly where the watch feels comfortable.I've worn it for sleep and have not found it awkward or annoying at all. I cannot comment on its sleep accuracy, but the amount of  deep sleep/rem time it registers does coincide with when i wake up refreshed and rested vs groggy.Battery life is excellent. Out of the box it had just under 50% and after 8 days it was at 18%, at which point i charged it just because i was heading out for a cycle. in that time it had two cycles and a run using the GPS.The \"MOVE!\" notifications are great, and made me realize that I dont move much from one end of the day to the other when working, so now i get up every hour for a quick stroll and stretch.It does notifications well too, letting me know if the phone is ringing, if i have a meeting or if i got a message. I expected nothing in this area as i read it was poor as a smart watch, but it does everything that i need and more.Nothing is perfect, and the biggest negative is its tracking of strength workouts. the rep counter is poor, and its a bit of a chore overall to create workouts & then use the watch correctly while doing workouts, often while gassed and not in the best shape for concentration. Ive found it best to enter workouts in via the app, track the rounds with the watch as im working out and correct the reps and times afterwards. not ideal but it suffices and allows me to keep all workouts in garmin connect.I would dock only half a star for this, but unfortunately thats not possible on Amazon.Will give an update after a few months to notify future potential buyers if everything is still living up to expectations.Update after 7 months:Still a fantastic piece of kit, one of the very very few items that has lived up to expectations.",
            "Amazons response to replace my faulty device was good (as expected). Unfortunately, when the replacement arrived, the seal on the Garmin box was broken, the foam holder that the watch is normally attached to was missing, and the watch had finger marks on it. Looks like it was previously used and returned.Amazon arranged for another replacement, no issue.Suggest that you carefully check when you take delivery.Love the watch though!",

            "The Fenix 6 is a great piece of kit. It does what it says on the tin! It does NOT have the music feature, contrary to what I thought (my fault)....you need the 6S, 6 Pro etc for music. It also does not have headphone connectivity. Apart from that the watch is superb and works well with Garmin connect. The only negative is - Sleep tracking....it sometimes fails to track sleep.",

This one, whilst still being relatively large, is perfect for me. I also wanted something which was easy and uncomplicated to use.  This ticks all those boxes.  I'm not technologically minded at all, so didn't want anything I couldn't easily understand or navigate my way around. This watch is just perfect. I wouldn't be without it now.",
            "Beautiful watch that feels gorgeous on but a few warnings. I had to return mine as this doesn\u2019t have Amazon music and Garmin Pay sucks if you\u2019re in the UK as only a few rare banks are accepted. The biggest on there is Santander. I was seriously looking forward to using this watch as an upgrade from Fenix 3HR but I can\u2019t justify the upgrade when I wanted it for pay and music so I didn\u2019t need my phone with me all the time.",

It great a creating off road routes which is a shame.Great battery life. Used it for swimming the other day and that\u2019s got some great features (drill times, rest times etc).It also looks great with the silver bezel.Would recommend to anyone that wants a decent garmin watch upgrade.",
            "Brought this for fitness mainly I got to say it's almost perfect I can't fault the navigation system or the customisation you can do my only gripe is the HR tracking and sleep tracking are poor sometimes it doesn't track sleep and the HR monitor doesn't track it's very inconsistent other than that it's a quality product rich in many features you can't go wrong battery life is excellent",
            "Excellent battery life even when not on battery saver. Build quality is brilliant, feels as if carved out of one block of metal yet it's not heavy.I had a Garmin watch before so I was comfortable with the very comprehensive app, though the Fenix is a much more capable watch in terms of information.It's not cheap for a sports watch, and unless you're using it for it's proper purpose may not be worth the extra expense over the many option in the market. But if you are using it for health and fitness measurement it is absolutely stonking at what it does and well worth the cost.",
            "Excellent watch and bought at a good price.Does all I needed of it.Heart rate monitor not the most accurate at times.The only thing that I would prefer is if bezel was higher to protect screen as when I use glass screen protector it sits slightly higher than bezel.Afraid to use without protector for this reasonHad a Suunto core and it bezel is higher and never used a screen protector and glass scratch free after many years use .",
            "It is a fantastic watch, the receiver is a keen road cyclist and it gives him all the information he needs, it even measures his sleep. As his Garmin is paired with his mobile he receives his messages on his watch as well",
            "battery life easy 2 weeks even with regular training (average 5 days a week for approx 1 hour). you can wear and forget (like i do) or delve into the detailed features to optimise and track everything. its comfortable too, its the first watch i wear at night without bother. would highly recommend over cheaper options as its an investment in your health in the long run and you can grow with it as you increase your fitness tracking and activity",
            "Bought this Garmin Fenix 6 as a replacement for a Fenix 5 that failed (and subsequently recovered leaving me with two watches!!!). The Fenix 6 screen is definitely an improvement over that used on the 5 and the software is also laid out better than the earlier iterations. While I didn't want to have to buy a new watch I am actually pleased with the newer design.",

            "This on paper is a really nice fitness watch with over a week's battery. My only let down is the screen. Coming from a galaxy smartwatch I'm to used to a vibrant screen.",
            "Great piece of kit. Took a while to pair with phone but Hauweii phone - that seems to be the problem. Sorted now however. So pleased I made the investment.",
            "Don't buy this if you plan to go off grid. You can't interact with your watch AT ALL through the phone app if you are outside cell coverage. You can't review your workouts, sleep data, blood oxygen....NOTHING. You can't ever set an alarm!!!! I spend 100 days a year off grid and this thing is nothing but a paper weight. I've been waiting for a year for them to fix this but they don't care. Buy a Galaxy Watch 4 or an Apple watch... Both of those allow you to access your watch and data off line. GARMIN SUCKS!!!!",
            "The face is too dark, and small writing, even with the backlight switched on. It\u2019s a big bulky watch for no reason, and really gets in the way when women go clothes shopping. I\u2019m going to get the Fitbit instead.",
            "I was expecting to pay \u00a3600 to update my Fenix but the white was on special offer so I\u2019m extremely happy especially since it\u2019s a 6s",
            "I love it. Thanks!",
            "Amazing watch, works out great, but I recommend using it with the Garmin chest strap, for even better accuracy. Recommend!!",
            "Downgraded rating from 5 to 2. Sport functions are great, but software on watch is complete garbage. Cannot connect to PC on the regular basis. Once completely refused to connect to phone suddenly (fixed with full reset). Stuck on menu with hard reboot required multiple times. And now I cannot use garmin exrpess app at all. It refused to connect, so I removed the app to reinstall and now no matter what I do and how many times I reboot, it say that I have to reboot. Basic function of syncing and connecting does not work consistently________Original impressionsYou can see what you are paying for. Look good, do not interfere with shirts a lot, very smart profile. All fitness stuff is awesome, battery holds for me for a week. Wish they would have a better option to schedule own weight cross fit exercises. You can do it in training by selecting strength, but there is not everything is there. It is about the software though. Watch is cool."

            "Updated Message,The ECG works after changing the Fitbit app settings to USA and changing your Fitbit profile to USA, after doing this, you'll see the ECG app in the app store for you to download.I bought two of these for my wife and I only to find out that the ECG is not available in Australia. ECG and AFIB was my only reason to forking up all this money.Thankfully Amazon has an amazing return policy and I will definitely be returning this.",
            "Very unhappy as this watch will not support it primary feature in Australia. The advanced heart rate sensor is disabled. Apparently this is made very clear once you open the box. This should be made more clear, even when I was in a local shop, it was sold to me as having ecg capability. This is my last fitbit.",
            "The first observation of this product was the extremely inaccurate HR measurements, especially on high-intensity activities. It was showing 80-90 BMP when I was at max cardio cycle with the expected 140-150 BMP. This was eventually causing inaccurate calorie counts, making the whole health monitoring concept meaningless. I was getting more reliable data from my Ionic, so I had to switch back to it.Very disappointing.",
            "Fitbit Sense's should last 6+ days after a full charge as advertised.  But my new Sense battery is draining quickly after 2 months of use. I don't have any notifications on, don't have SpO2 features, and don't have the always display on.",
            "I love this fit bit.The only thing I can't change to my favourite clock face.I can only use the ones in the fit bits website.Does anyone know how to do this?",
            "It broke after acouple months I paid alot for it I didn't bang it on anything or anything like that",
            "Battery not as long lasting as advertised . No ECG app in Australia",
            "great fitbit to get",
            "Works perfectly, arrived before the ETA and cheaper than anywhere else.",
            "Easy to use, syncs with my fitness pal",
            "This watch looks great but there are too many problems with it that keep happening on the other versions I have owned ad complained about.  It can't track swimming laps properly, often is not accurate when tracking exercise intensity, heart rate works when resting but is not accurate when working out.  It can't detect when I am working with weights or strength training.  The sleep score is often inaccurate telling me I got 5 or 6 hours of sleep when I actually got 7 hours.  There are just too many things wrong with Fitbit that I sadly won't be upgrading with them.  Time to try something different.  Go Garmin Venu 2s.",
            "I love this watch. It\u2019s so convenient with Alexa built right in and tips for handling stress. As for seeing the clock face, choose always on.  Don\u2019t have to worry about rotating your wrist to see it. I think it is really cool and I love the lunar white/gold colour. I think it\u2019s an awesome watch don\u2019t know why there are bad reviews on it.Update: I\u2019ve had this watch for awhile now and it has kept me from having bad emotional storms that I used to get every few days or so.  Sometimes they were so bad I would have to miss work.  It tells me if I\u2019m getting a little stressed before I even realize it and I\u2019m able to nip things in the bud with the Fitbit apps mindfulness meditations. It has been super helpful.  Highly recommend!Update: I have had the watch for I guess since  September and it has been wonderful it makes fitness fun and meaningful.  I bought a Versa 3 for my husband and he loves it.  It\u2019s very accurate with sleep tracking, the mobile app is also super helpful in motivating m to reach my goals.",
            "Review updated after more than a month of usage:Summary: If you have been oscillating between sense and apple watch 6 series, go for sense - battery life is what sealed the deal for me. Amazing beautiful watch - perfect companion for a journey to good health.Pros:1. Great battery life - I have been using this watch full blast with always on display and using the EDA sensor at least thrice a day, and installing and uninstalling so many watch faces. Third straight day, and the battery is still there.Edit: In a month I installed so many apps and watch faces and have now stabilised with select 5. Battery performance is superb. On weekends I forget to charge and it is cool.2. The EDA/ stress sensor: Very responsive. I checked the EDA scan feature a few times. It actually gave more EDA responses when I was a little stressed. Seems like a very handy tool for me - especially because I have had stress related issues in the past. It is a perfect companion for my daily meditation and Yoga practice too.Edit after a month usage: EDA/ stress sensor is good but it doesnt tell you anything you dont know already.For future edit: At times, I feel restless and anxious - and I calm myself by taking a quick walk around. Will check what the EDA scan says at that time. Will update - still havent faced the issue again.3. Heart rate tracker - It is fitbit's best. And fitbit is already the best out there in HR tracking. So no further comments.Edit after a month: At times while exercising, I feel there is a lag in the heartbeat numbers. Or maybe that's how our hearts work - they take some seconds before they can fire up. :) Will keep an eye on this.4. Notifications: Using with iPhone. Everything as expected. If it could show a preview of the image in messages, it would have been awesome! I did see this discussion happening in the fitbit developer forum - so I guess it is in the works.Edit after a month: Still no news on image in notifications. I don't mind this though.5. Step tracking - Precise.6. Sleep tracking - Sweet.Edit after a month: One of the most used features for me - everyday sleep score tracking is really helping me with my stress management. Recently got an 'excellent sleep' badge tag - for the first time in my 2 years of fitbit usage (wore Inspire HR earlier - that also tracked sleep)7. Band is too light - I have upgraded from fitbit inspire HR. Had used an after market stainless band for that - compared to that, the sense band is thin air. While sleeping, I tend to forget I am wearing the sense.8. Special tid-bits that I loved:a. It has a smart alarm feature - which wakes you up before your alarm if you complete a sleep cycle within half an hour of your upcoming alarm. This makes you wake up fresh af, instead of groggy - like the regular alarms do, if you are in the middle of your sleep cycle. Neat.b. Amazing watch-faces. A lot of free options to choose from. The one which allows personal photos to be put up as a watch face is cool. I bought a chronograph one for 1 dollar. Can change accent color as per my clothing. Pretty cool. Too many amazing watch faces.Edit after a month: Too many sweet free watch faces. Paying a dollar wasnt worth  the purchase I made a month ago. :Dc. Many knick-knack apps you can install and try on. I like the weather app and the news app. Guess more will be coming soon. Flipboard doesnt work yet - guess it will work in future.Special trick: Made the ECG work in India by just changing the location to US in the app profile. No VPN required. Works like a charm! What an easy way to hoodwink the policy loopholes - guess it was designed that way - makes one an accomplice in cheating the policy, though. Smart...Cons:1. It is not apple smart watch. I know brand 'apple' is a deciding factor for many. This is not apple - but the build quality looks as good. Will have to see how this thing wears down over next few months/ years.2. Fitbit premium app : The free version of the app shows almost all the metrics (except a few detailed explanations, like the stress score details, monthly trends of sleep parameters etc.). While the sense comes with a 6 months membership of the premium part of the app, I would not really want to spend some 849 rs per month post 6 months of buying a 30k smartwatch! Fitbit guys - you need to curb your greed! Guess when google takes fitbit over, this issue will be sorted out.---Will update the review after a month of usage - DONE. Edited above.",

            "This is my first ever smartwatch, so I can't compare this device's functionality to other watches, much less other fitbit products. The reason I bought this version was because it was the only smartwatch I could find that had all the features I wanted -- the stress management in particular was appealing.That said, the watch itself is... underwhelming. While my experience with it has been more on the positive side and I'm not planning to return it, I can't actually disagree with any of the negative reviews posted here. Having to turn the screen on manually is annoying, the setting to turn it on when you look at it doesn't always work (especially when laying down), and the always-on display drains way too much battery, which already doesn't last as long as I had hoped.I definitely had hoped for on-demand pulse ox readings as well, being that I'm asthmatic, but since sleep apnea was another thing I've been concerned about, I at least get some functionality out of that.The app does have the syncing issue someone else mentioned, but it doesn't actually bother me. The sleep feature also works perfectly for me.I am getting a lot of useful data with it, and I can't wait to wear it swimming, once the pandemic is over. It's a fine watch, but for the price? I don't know if I can recommend it, personally.",
            "This is a very nice smartwatch with a lot of positives.  If you are looking at the Sense you are probably looking at an Apple watch as well.  Hopefully, I will be able to help you make up your mind after reading this review.Let me start off by saying that I currently own an Apple watch (Series 4) and absolutely love it.  I am a watch collector and never thought I would wear the Apple watch as much as I do.  I have 30+ watches and since I bought the Apple two years ago, I very rarely wear the others at all.  That is saying something!  Since I got the Fitbit, I have been \u201cgeeking out\u201d and wearing one on each wrist.  Yeah, I know, I look like an idiot.  I just wanted to test out the two side-by-side and couldn\u2019t think of a better way to do it.  Note:  While reading the review, keep in mind that the Sense is more comparable to the newer Series 6 so consider this when making your decision.Battery Life *****The Fitbit has a fantastic battery life.  I can squeeze about a day and a half out of the Apple, but I can easily get twice that with the Fitbit.  Keep in mind I have the Fitbit set to constant on.  If I took that setting off, I should get close to a week.  My Series 4 doesn\u2019t have the constant on setting, but Apple claims 18 hours for the Series 6 with this setting.  The Fitbit definitely wins this one.Steps/Activity/Sleep ****The Fitbit tracks all my activity as well as the Apple and I like the sleep tracking better on the Sense.  It gives me more information than the Apple and the fact that I don\u2019t have to wake up and charge it before leaving the house is a definite plus.  With the Apple, I have to make sure I put it on the charger after I wear it through the night or it won\u2019t make it to the end of the day.  Another win for the Fitbit when you take the sleep tracking into account.Sensors ****I am giving the Fitbit a 4 here, but I found the Apple does a better job with my heart rate.  I have a chest strap I use for working out and the Apple was pretty much dead on with the chest strap.  I found the Fitbit to be a bit \u201claggy\u201d when it came to giving me instant feedback for my heart rate.  When selecting my workout, I also found the Apple had more workout options compared to the Fitbit.  I did find the Fitbit more accurate when it came to counting my flights of stairs however.  The oxygen sensor on the Fitbit is also a nice plus and since the Series 4 doesn\u2019t have this option I can\u2019t really do a comparison.  The Sense also as a skin temp sensor and an EDA sensor that measures stress levels.  I found I didn\u2019t really use either that much, but you may find these valuable.  I do like the fall down feature on the Apple which the Sense does not have.  This is especially a good feature for anyone who lives alone or has issues with balance.  The watch will dial 911 and the contacts you set up if you are immobile for any amount of time.  Overall, both watch sensors work well and each has plenty of extras.  Depending on your needs you may like some features better than others, but I would have to say this one is pretty close.Apps/Extras ***Since I am using an iPhone, this gives an unfair advantage to the Apple watch and the apps/watch faces are simply better than those on the Fitbit.  For example:  I use Golfshot+ (recommended) on my phone/watch and it is excellent.  Unfortunately, I could only find one app for golf on the Sense and I was not impressed.  Notifications from my various devices (MyQ, Skybell, Blink cameras, etc.) are great on my Apple, but nonexistent on the Fitbit.  The wallet also works better on the Apple watch as well.  Fitbit in Canada supports Visa/Mastercard, but not Amex as of yet.  I can also add music to my Apple watch, but cannot add any on the Fitbit.  You can only get music on the watch with a $13.50 CAD premium subscription.  Fitbit does give you 6 months for free though.  Even though I am not a huge fan of Siri, it does work better than Alexa on the watch.  If I was using an Android phone, maybe it would work better.  Another issue I had was answering texts and phone calls.  With the Apple, I can return texts and answer phone calls on the watch itself.  Unfortunately, you can only respond to texts on the Sense if you have an Android phone.  Finally, watch faces are another thing Apple does better.  While there are plenty of really nice third party watch faces for the Sense, you pretty much have to pay for most of them.  With Apple they are all free and you can tweak them to your liking.  Apple definitely wins this one.  In all fairness, since I didn\u2019t pair this with an Android, I am still giving the watch three stars in this category.Comfort/Straps/etc. ****The Sense, like the Apple, is very comfortable to wear.  They are both very light and you don\u2019t even know they are on your wrist.  In fact, when I first switched to a smartwatch, I found this took a bit of getting used to as I always wore a watch that had some weight.  Unlike a traditional watch, the straps on the two watches are very easy to change so you can quickly go from sport to dress with no tools required.  Both are also easy to read and manipulate when opening apps, changing faces, etc.  I\u2019d have to say this is a tie.  However, I do like the crown on the Apple better than the button on the Sense and I did find the Apple to be \u201csnappier\u201d during everyday use.Overall, this is an excellent watch.  There is certainly a lot to like and it costs $100 less than the 40mm Series 6 Apple.  If you have an Android phone, I think this is probably the one to buy.  Since I am using an iPhone, I find the Apple watch integrates better and can do more when it comes to apps, calls, etc.  I suppose it really boils down to what you want to do with the watch.  Both work very well and if you own an iPhone the decision may be a bit more difficult.  After wearing it for a couple of weeks, I have really gotten used to the Sense and I am especially fond of how much better it is in the battery department.  I may just have to keep wearing both.Recommended!Good luck with your decision/purchase.",
            "This is my first smart watch (apart from the Versa 2 I tried briefly which I thought was just not worth it). It's a bad product. Bad design, bad software, etc. I don't really want to give a detailed review as their are just too many negative points to go through, many of which have already been covered by other reviews here and reviews online.Update: I kept the watch in the end even though I had a bitter feeling about it. There have been software updates recently that have rectified some things and added some functionalities, which makes it somewhat more worthwhile than before. Still many problems though, and they introduced new problems with the recent firmware updates.Update 2: I think it's worth mentioning that it's been many times the alarm doesn't go off, not something that should happen with such a basic and essential feature. I'm also having very bad synching problems (always had synching problems but they gotten much much worse lately)",

            "Likes: Small, relatively lightweight, comfortable even when sleeping with it, all the sports tracking you'll ever need, maps!!, solid battery, built like a tank, looks nice, music and Garmin Pay work without issues, and performs well.Dislikes: The buttons on mine were really stiff, but I guess I'm used to them, sapphire screen makes the display more dim (but no problem if you turn up brightness to ~60-70%).Decided for 6S rather than 6 due to smaller size and lighter weight. I have ~16-17cm wrists and it fits nicely. Could have gone up to the 6, but figured the 6S would be more easier to live with personally. Owned this watch for about 1 month, works an absolute treat. The >$1K AUD price tag might be a bit steep, but when on sale (purchased ~$900) it's a good deal with all the features that comes with it.I find that the GPS is accurate (GPS + GLONAA, 1 second recording, 1-2 mins of GPS soaking), HR tracking is fine, SpO2 sensor a little off, sleep tracking and body battery tracking surprisingly accurate. The interface is intuitive and pleasant to work with. Heaps of exercises/tracking options to choose from.Overall: Perfect little sportswatch so far. Happy with the purchase and can't really about anything.",
            "I had the Fenix 6 pro... But wanted to get better battery life so coughed up for the solar version. Only problem with it was that the solar did not work. Could not get any solar charge. The solar intensity chart remained at 0% no matter how much direct sunlight it got. To Amazon's credit they did provide a full refund but not a replacemnt which was also disapointing because I goit the watch during the cyber sales. Now that it was back to full price... well you can eaily do the math on why I got offered a refund only. Back to using my Fenix 6 pro and it is easily the best all-rounder multisport watch I have used and will contionue to use.",
            "I\u2019ve long been a fan of Garmin devices and previously have had a Fenix5x for some years. The data and feedback it gives is amazing. I am also a massive fan of the inbuilt training options. The Fenix 6 is a bug step forward from the 5 and the metadata is excellent. I bought the device on special and use it a lot, so the price is mostly justifiable; however, at retail, you\u2019d want to genuinely be interested in training pay full price. That said, any of the cheaper Garmin options are also excellent products if you don\u2019t need/want all the bells and whistles.",
            "I have had Fenixes for last 4 years, all S models and Sapphire glass. Most have had a lifespan of over a year and as an active athete previously I was always out and about, doing stuff, with the watch on. Over time the rubber bands would all we worn out but surprisingly none ever had significant issues with the glass.I have had this watch for about a month now and the glass just isnt comparable. I live a non-active life at the moment and honestly I have barely done anything and it already has multiple scratches on the glass. I did consider this when buying this watch but didnt realise the difference is going to be this significant.",
            "Have yet to work through a lot of the features in depth but everything I've set up to date works well. This watch has far more to offer than I'll ever need; it's capability exceeds mine in many areas. Using only the health monitoring basics so far I have found the battery life to be great. The size is something new for me after only ever wearing a conventional watch prior to this one. I'm happy that I chose the smaller model. I can see that this watch will serve any active/sporting person very well. The price through Amazon was the best by far & delivery was fast.",
            "I\u2019ve been an Apple Watch user since the first one was released. Got tired of having to charge the thing every night & being notified every time someone passed wind. This watch gives me EVERYTHING I valued the Watch for - (Garmin) Pay, the time (!!) & health/workout data. And it never runs out of charge, so I can hike all day & night & now that all the data & the route are being recorded. The Fenix & Garmin displays are awesome!",
            "I bought the watch back in June and have been getting consistent issues with it from the start.First the step tracking wouldn't persist reliably, some days just don't log in the historic graphs despite wearing the watch (and hitting my goals).The sleep tracking has the same  problem except it has never recorded a nights sleep historically. You can get the sleep information off the watch but not through the Garmin app.I ignored these problems since historical tracking wasn't a huge issue to me as I could just keep up on a daily basis but the other day I went for a hike and wanted to track the distance, apparently over the ~10km trek I moved 0km and gained 0m in height. The map knew where I was whenever I checked it but for some reason the activity failed to log distance, since then it's failed to do so for my daily walking activities as well, and hasn't logged any of my step counts to my historic graphs.Incredibly disappointing to buy a premium product and have it fail to deliver even the most basic features.",
            "Loves the features of this watch but the battery life isn't the best. I feel like my Fenix 5S had a better battery life. I use it 2-3 times a day to record activities (HIIT, run, walk) and by the end of the day, the battery has drained about 10% (this is also without using music, or wifi.) You will need to customise your settings for optimal battery life - turn off things you don't use. Other than that, it looks great and I LOVE the maps feature! Can't wait to test it on the slopes too.",
            "With so many sensors, the Fenix 6S does sooo many things, and it's very configurable. The only negatives I have are that it's hard to view the screen in less than bright outdoor or indoor light (I believe my \"Saphire\" glass is actually worse than the standard \"Gorilla\" glass), and it's a little pricey. I'm a 180cm, 80kg male, but this small 6S version of the Fenix fits my wrist best.",
            "The watch worked for 1 day, then tried an update that failed due to a corrupt file, it then only loaded 50% and was un-usable..  garmin customer service are ok, they went around in circles for a week, and you get several different people you have to describe the fault to, over and over, try the same fault finding from each representative...and now finally I'm to receive a brand new watch replacement.. be wary of updates..",
            "Delivered in two days \ud83d\udc4d. I am very happy with the purchase. I have had the watch for one month and still learning all of the features and using the widgets and tracking for fitness and riding. I purchased the solar option and seems to be a nice to have but not a must have feature and not sure if the extra $ is necessary unless you have a reason to have it. The only negative I see at this stage is the watch seems to disconnect from the phone from a relative short distance (1 room away etc) which can be annoying. I am using Garmin pay with no issues at all and have loaded some music to connect to headphone via Bluetooth when walking. The watch does everything I expected and loving it.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0I bought it last August, it\u2019s a great quality watch. I hit it three times on the edge of the swimming pool that made several scratches on the metal part. It helps me find out the way out of the map area. The app provides lots of customized plan according to your exercise routine.",
            "The watch appeared to have been used as there was a scratch on the bezel, you could tell as the box security tab was stuck back, only minor didn\u2019t want to wait for a return but took the edge off something expensive. Garmin watch is what is required in a sports watch. Not that complicated to understand either. Lots of info to understand how to use the watch. Also quick delivery over Christmas and easy to follow to buy on line as I usually like to go to a shop.",
            "Battery life is one reason I bought the garmin fenix 6s.  I previously owned a fenix 5s and it battery life was great, still at at least 8 days after 3 years.I love the additional functions in the 6s.",
            "Bought due to my whole paddling club was using Garmin to track their activities.Loved the music feature so I didn't have to carry my S21 Ultra while running.6X is very big for a skinny guy's wrist so I downgraded to a Fenix 6 instead.",
            "Absolutely love my new Fenix 6X saphire up graded from a Fenix 3HR that I thought was the bee's knees  but glad I have some new features on the 6X like incident detection that I used the very next day. Highly recommended if you thinking of purchasing.",
            "Great watch. Highly recommend. Tough screen and useful training apps and data collection and analysis from Garmin Connect. Amazon Australia delivered to door within 2 days of ordering. \ud83d\ude4c",
            "Great watch and fitness tracker. The battery life is about as expected. I haven't been able to test the full power of the solar charging function as it's been extremely overcast and raining since I bought it.Watch is exactly as advertised. It's only con is the price. Wait until it's on sale.",
            "This is an excellent watch, worth every penny. It is a high end fitness/health watch, can customise it to your personal taste, all the way from choosing a face watch to functionality. If you are a fitness freak then this watch is a must.",
            "Good product but on the expensive side but so is Apple Watch. This provides so much more data and functions  than Apple Watch. Battery life is fantastic. Although I think Solar is a bit of gimmick. Left in the Australian sun for two hours and it overheated. Won\u2019t be doing it again. Overall good so far"

            "I am an Apple fanboy, having many of their products, but I was hesitating for a long time in purchasing their watches as the short battery life has always out me off. Eventually after years of procrastination I took the plunge - resulting in this review.The Apple Watch SE does everything I want from such a product and overall I am very happy with it. Granted, battery life still sucks, at most I can squeeze out 2 days and a bit per charge, using it only for the barest of things such as glancing at the time occasionally or checking for messages. No fancy fitness tracking etc., and even with WiFi turned off.I would love to give it a full 5 star but one overriding shortcoming is the very dim display within dark environments. The auto-brightness feature cannot be turned off (as opposed to iPhones and iPads), and the employed algorithm to regulate the brightness is way too agressive biased towards saving battery life at the expense of legibility of the watch in dark scenarios.This shortfall is well known beginning with Apple Watch Series 5, and has carried over to the SE and Series 6 models as well. Countless disgruntled users on various online forums ask for the same thing: \"Apple, please give us a switch to disable auto-brightness, or some other means to set a higher brightness level at low lights\". So far Apple decided to ignore these calls, and one can only hope that with a future Watch OS release there will be a fix for this.In summary: if you wear glasses and want to check the time at night in your bedroom, you will struggle without glasses to make out the current time. Therefore, one of the most needed and wanted features of any smart watch is a big fail with the latest Apple watches!",
            "This watch is a good mix between the cheaper and older series and the newer series apple watches.Does what you\u2019d expect, haven\u2019t ran into any issues yet. The provided silicone band is not my taste so I always opt for other bands, but that\u2019s personal preference.",
            "Functionally indistinguishable from series 6, great watch that will satisfy your smart watch needs. Worthwhile Upgrade from series 3",
            "Product lasted 2 days before being unresponsive - have had to send back for replacement",
            "Apple watch itself is really good, easy to navigate but the only downside of it is that needs to be charged every night."

            "All in all, a pretty good watch. My daughter loves it.My big problem is that they didn't attempt to waterproof it in any way. My daughter dipped her hand in the bath to check temperature and that's that. All over folks, watch is dead and won't recover even after it's fully dried out.Accidents happen with 8 year olds all the time, so I wouldn't buy this again for that very reason.",

            "Honestly, it does not actually deserve such a low rating. The reason I give it a one-star because I want my message to be seen by other customers (most people would sort by lowest rating), and I think my advice is helpful as I've used and compared a few Fitbit models.Overall it is a pretty good deal. You are getting so many functions like contactless payment, building GPS and so on at this cheap price level. The design is awesome too!However, as an avid mountain biker, GPS accuracy in the bush is essential for me. I tracked my riding with Charge 4, and the GPS accuracy is terrible comparing with my previous Fibit Ionic based on the route on Strava. As a result, I returned it.If I were a customer who does not care about GPS accuracy, I'd give it a 5 star for sure. However, if you are someone who wants a serious GPS tracker, stay away from it!",
            "Inbuilt GPS highly inaccurate on multiple occasions (all my runs). Shows me teleporting some 1km during my run which leads to inaccurate pace times (1h/km to 2min/km). The only thing I can count on is overall pace.Using the dynamic GPS which links with the phone's GPS saves battery but also shows the same issues as the inbuilt GPS.I had tried troubleshooting recommended on forums, but nothing has solved these issues.SpO2 not provided unless you are premium. This also includes other features. Considering this was an important aspect of my purchase I was not happy with this.That being said, the fit is fine, the heart rate monitor appears to be quite accurate. Do note that the calories burned during exercise need to be taken with a grain of salt as it appears they are overestimated on most of my activities.I like the sleep metrics as it gives me a visual on how to improve my sleep as I go through the different sleep cycles. So far it appears to be quite accurate in accordance to my actual sleep and wake times.Overall a nice watch for HR monitoring, comfort and fit, as well as sleep analysis. But if you're seriously about accurate GPS and having to pay premium for SpO2 I would consider another watch.",
            "It\u2019s a decent watch for the price. Not everything is exactly accurate - sleep is off and steps are occasionally not entirely accurate, but it\u2019s nothing super bad and for the price it\u2019s super worth it. I\u2019m still in the 3 month premium trial period with the app that comes with the product, so I\u2019m not sure what the free app version is like, but the paid version is decent, mostly the sleep is just not super accurate so take it with a grain of salt.",
            "Same issue I had previously with the charge 2.  Lining up\\getting the watch to charge with its bump and grind contact system is a nightmare.  Not sure what possessed me to buy a 4 after having an ordeal with the 2 everytime i needed to charge it.  Got sucked in by the online reviews i guess, i thought that this was different or at least improved.  Massive PITA to just simply the battery, a fundementally flawed system. Support for the issue is wilfully ignorant.",
            "I can\u2019t use this watch for what I wanted it for, keeping an eye on my blood pressure.  The differences from when I tested my watch against my portable, health recognised, blood pressure monitor, varied too much when my blood pressure was higher.  The easy way to use it was perfect as you could swipe easily through.  The face of the watch was quite big too but no doubt necessary to hold all the inside mechanism",
            "Love the variety of functions . I did have a problem butte return process was very quick and easy and the replacement is issue free .",
            "I bought the Charge 4 for its inbuilt GPS, however, it has been a major disappointment.  It does not stay connected for the full length of my run and does not reconnect.  Consequently it cannot show data related to sections of the run and only estimates information for the run leading to large differences in information related to exactly the same route.  Good feedback provided if you pay to subscribe to the Premium app.  Bottom line is do not buy it if you require the inbuilt GPS.",
            "I would give this a five star, except I find the swiping action a bit on the fiddly side. It mistakes swiping for selecting a good part of the time. The attached band also a bit sweaty, maybe a better material should be used. Also, sometimes does not detect movement and thereby give credit for steps. Overall, however, I like the device.",
            "Great fit, small profile so unobtrusive, good battery life, excellent features. Does the simple things well, like tell the time and date, and the fitness things are great too - steps, heart rate, sleep, movement reminders. One frustration is it sometimes loses GPS signal when I'm on a long walk, so I'm not able to track my activity unless I use the phone. But otherwise, really happy with it.",
            "I like the range of information available to me each day and after a nights sleep. Comfortable to wear and the app is very user friendly. No dislikes. It\u2019s a s\u2019big step up from the $29.00 tracker that I tried to see if ima tracker would be useful."

            "I love this watch unfortunately it is painfully obvious that Garmin has slapped an OLED display on one of their sports watches. The watch does everything perfectly except one ESSENTIAL thing and that is to turn on the display when required. Unlike an apple watch the wrist gesture to turn on the display is VERY unreliable. The gesture seems to be tuned to an outdoor situation where someone standing will raise their arm to look at the time. It should have occurred to Garmin that people wanting an OLED display would likely be using the watch in more domestic/office situations. If Garmin don't fix this then then it is hard to recommend that people buy this watch. The other serious flaw in this watch is that there can be an unacceptable delay (up to 4 seconds) in the turn on time for custom watch faces downloaded from the IQ app. Garmin has some work to do if they want to compete with Apple and Samsung in the smart watch area. Venu can't just be a Vivoactive with an OLED slapped on!!!",
            "Hi, the watch itself is nice, good display.Aside from a light burn feeling on skin due to sensors and redness probably due to wristband. .. (never had these problems with 24/7 365 days of use for 3 years with Fitbit Versa 1...Overall the Venu is disappointing and I decided to return it. It is not good for the price.Touch screen display is a little inaccurate... (I have thin fingers and Versa was more reactive).Sleep tracking is stupid and USELESS! and you need to adjust your time of sleep every morning if you rememeber at what time you went to bed. In fact, it will calculate your sleep time when you tell him you are going to bed and your wake up time. So if you go to bed later, the stupid application will start recording you are sleeping from the original time you put. We are in 2020 and Garmin cannot fix this thing? Battery runs out about 25% each day and I have not used GPS feature at all yet! I only use the watch for training at gym (90 minutes) and Pulse Ox only during night and still... battery drops 25% each day... so at the third day, you are at about 30% ... and you must re charge it.So sleep tracking is bad and useless, the reading of your Health details is not user friendly and personally I do not know how to read the data, even if I have studied the parameters. Uneccesaarly complicated. Fitbit feeds you with nice overall insights and comments.I came from 3 years of heavy use with Fitbit Versa 1 and althouth Fitbit is now bad with its Premium Membership, I found the Versa readings and overall app (not premium) more suitable to give general and reliable Health stats.Very very disappointed. The reason why I choose to try Garmin and in particular Venu was for the geral reviews and I have missed about sleeping tracking dramatic inaccuracy, battery efficiency and the watch face (third parties) are also long to load:you turn the wrist and it takes approximately 2 seconds to make it appears. It is frustrating. That's a pity....and then... It is not difficult to put an alert regaridng drinking water and yet Garmin has not provided this simple feature... but it reminds you to move... I have been reading comments and this is something that has been suggested many months ago but Garmin does not seem caring at all... so you know what!take your Garmin device back and next time care more about your customers comments and suggestions.Heart rate is as good as Fitbit Versa 1...I am now heading back to Fitbit and maybe... maybe.... I will choose to pay the premium membership and finally having a proper Health insights... there is no point to save 50-80 dollars if then you cannot use properly a Health smartwatch....",
            "There's a lot to like about this watch. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the sleep tracking could be better automated. You have to enter your typical sleeping times but as a shift worker I don't really have typical sleep times. This means that sometimes it doesn't detect my sleep at all if I'm on nights. I feel that it should be able to detect me sleeping automatically without me having to constantly delve into the settings.",
            "I love everything about this smart watch. I was a little worried it would look bulky on my 15inch thin wrist BUT it doesn't!  (Trying to upload a pic but won't let me). It is soo packed with features & the watch & apps are so easy to use! GPS is on point, as is battery life & accuracy.  Recharges super fast when needed.  Would I buy this watch again.. Definitely! Highly recommend!",
            "Shipped to Australia with no problem, fully compatible in Australia (Celsius, metres, etc. no problem).It's a great smart watch, very happy with it.It would be great if it were a little more slimline. The women's models all sacrifice screen size so it's good that these are effectively unisex watches - particularly with the colour/material selection.",
            "Good functional sports' watch.  Drawbacks are that you can't see the screen in sunlight and starting the Run function at the start of a footrace is a bit hit or miss.  This may improve with practice.  Overall I'm satisfied with the product.",
            "I like how it works, need to practice up on it a lot though as I get a little confused on the operating of it.  The battery does not last as long as stated, I do not do much exercise, apart from walking and it lasts for 2-3 days for me.  Otherwise I like the way it looks and the screen views.",
            "Happy with the Garmin Venu, set up was easy and battery life is acceptable. The auto activity start, GPS and ability to download Spotify playlists make it a real winner. Great price on amazon, well cheaper than Australian retail stores!",
            "Bought it for my husband.  He loves it. Wears it everyday.  He experiments with different watch faces. Always checking the data ( ie distance walked etc). It alerts him to text messages and phone calls.  A great product",
            "I bought this for someone who is quadriplegic.  They found that the feature to make the display stay on didn\u2019t work well and being quadriplegic they were unable to check the time without help which is disappointing"

It has an amazing bright display with so many dial screens to select from, my personal favourite is the default one. It displays all the notifications from all the apps on my iPhone, although i would have loved if the complete notification can be seen or the font size on the watch can be reduced. You receive incoming call notifications on the watch as well but it would have been great if i could just mute the call from the watch itself. Other than that, I was able to control my music player on the phone via the controls on the watch. Best part about this watch is the battery life, with heart-rate sensor turned off i am able to get easily week long battery life which is just amazing. The watch overall is a great deal at this price although there are some minor software improvements which could be made to further make this watch great deal for your bucks."

That said itcertainly measured up in other areas. It is a touch screen and the images are crystal clear. The featuresare responsive on screen so no problem with that point.The camera pictures are somewhat disappointing and the video aspect is similar.You are able to load MP3 files and although that may be viewed as dated -it gives the youngsterthe opportunity to play music.There are also games which is a nice feature.There is no Bluetooth unfortunately but to be balanced about this there are limits to what isavailable for the cost.The fact that you can change the screen image to suit is really good.I echo another reviewers comment about children being tech savvy -they certainly are and willpick up if a product is lacking.Overall, this is a good smart watch, but lacks finesse in certain aspects.

Whereas, the other two colours (pink & blue) are more suitable for young kids, in my opinion.The user manual included is very helpful indeed.A micro-USB cable is in the box.The watch charges in a reasonable time.The Video & Camera quality is just basic.It does remind me of the early mobile cameras.But still fun for kids to have a camera in the watch.Sound quality of the media player is pretty good. Better than what I expected in kids' watches. It is easy to navigate other options when the music still plays in the background, which is a good feature to have.Watch display is good.There are different clock faces to choose from, based on age groups.There is a Torch on one side above the power button. It can be turned On/Off from the options menu.It would make a nice gift for kids.But the price of \u00a334.90 is slightly high.",
            "I already have an all singing and dancing smart watch but it is black and it doesn\u2019t allow me to change straps so I don\u2019t feel it looks very feminine when I am dressed up to go out for any special occasion.  This pink watch fits my adult wrist perfectly well and as I don\u2019t t need to make phone calls with it I haven\u2019t added a SIM card which also means that I don\u2019t have to download an app and connect the watch to my phone.  This means that the watch can still do a lot of things without me being tethered to my phonelike my usual smart watch is.  This watch is perfect for young adults and teenagers as it features a few nice watch faces and has a touch screen.  It can have music added to it as well as photos so I think there is a lot of value for money where this smart watch is concerned.  The watch itself looks amazing on my wrist and is very comfortable too.  I really think this watch is good value for money as a starter smart watch but it isn\u2019t just a basic watch so I think any teen would be delighted with what it can do.",
            "Most children love watches especially if they see adults wearing them. This is a very good smart watch for children. My grandson loves it and wears it daily.Just like a smart watch there are many things this watch can do. Alarm clock, calculator, listen to music, take pics etc.I recommend you buy a 2g SIM card to take full advantage of this watch.Well made watch with many different functions- well worth the price.",
            "It's awfy big for a wee wrist as the 7 year old who is wearing this will attest.  But the gizmos and whatsits seem to be keeping her happy.  As you would expect for the price the camera and the MP3 player are a bit rubbish but bear in mind it's a toy watch.  The games seem to be OK and a nice diversion but there is literally no interest in some of the functions - calculator, pedometer, recorder, stopwatch - they were all try once and ignore.  But it's good enough for a wee one and makes a nice present.",
            "This is an interesting smartwatch for kids that has a few interesting features.  It has a medium quality construction, with a half decent backlit color LCD touch screen.  It has very basic APPS installed with no ability to add applications.  The watch camera and games are low to medium quality overall, but will give a child something to do when bored.  The integrated phone works, it requires a specific sim card from SpeedTalk, it's a very simple but effective way to keep tabs on your child.  The SOS feature is very good, if your child activates this feature it will automatically call 2 numbers continuously until one connects.  It\u2019s an interesting smartwatch that works as described.",
            "this is a nice smartwatch for a younger child. it looks attractive and visually the design is geared towards younger children it's very affordable and also functional. this is touch screen and comes in three colours it has a variety of basic functions and it's a great first affordable smartwatch for a kid I personally think 12 is a bit old considering youngsters nowadays and this is much more suited towards the 6 plus.",
            "Ich finde die Kinder Smartwatch insgesamt ganz okay. Man muss sich nat\u00fcrlich bei dem Preis sicherlich bewusst werden, dass es eine Einstiegs-Smartwatch ist und ideal f\u00fcr Kinder, die jetzt zum ersten Mal  sowas benutzen wollen. Daf\u00fcr ist es sicherlich sehr, sehr gut, weil sie dann auch die ersten Schritte mit der Smartwatch lernen k\u00f6nnen und auch das wirklich einfach bedienen k\u00f6nnen. Man muss sich nat\u00fcrlich hierbei bewusst werden, dass der Funktionsumfang als auch die Qualit\u00e4t nicht besonders herausragend ist, so ist sicherlich die Kameraqualit\u00e4t sehr niedrig, Aber das Wichtigste ist, dass man einfach telefonieren kann und auch erreichbar ist und dass man auf die Uhrzeit gucken kann. Wie gesagt, als Einstiegsger\u00e4t f\u00fcr ein Kind ist das sicherlich ganz okay und es bereitet dem Kind sicherlich auch viel Spa\u00df und sieht auch wirklich gut aus. Allerdings kann man nat\u00fcrlich bei dem Preis nichts Hochwertiges erwarten. Das muss man sich auf jeden Fall bewusst werden.",

            "Tenemos un ni\u00f1o de cuatro a\u00f1os y hab\u00edamos pensado que dentro de poco tiempo, nos gustar\u00eda tener alguna manera de comunicarnos con \u00e9l cuando estuviera en alguna excursi\u00f3n o algo as\u00ed, pero no queremos un ni\u00f1o tan peque\u00f1o con un m\u00f3vil, as\u00ed que nos pareci\u00f3 buena idea la del reloj con una tarjeta sim para solucionar ese tema, y pillamos este.El reloj tiene una construcci\u00f3n sencilla toda hecha en plastico. Se nota que no es resistente al agua. Yo no lo acercar\u00eda a cualquier humedad, porque tiene varios agujeros en la estructura (como para el altavoz) que tienen contacto directo con la bater\u00eda, as\u00ed que hay que tener ese cuidado. La pulsera es de silicona y es bastante c\u00f3moda. En tama\u00f1o, en un ni\u00f1o de cuatro a\u00f1os, es enorme, pero no queda del todo mal y mi hijo no se molesta en llevarlo puesto.Viene con el reloj su manual y un cable de carga micro usb. Para cargarlo, tienes que destapar el puerto que est\u00e1 en el lateral izquierdo del reloj. Para acceder al sitio donde pones la tarjeta sim, abres la parte trasera del reloj y quitas la bater\u00eda. Es bastante sencillo hacerlo. Coge la se\u00f1al muy r\u00e1pido y en las llamadas, se escucha bien (si no hay mucho ruido cerca) y la otra persona tambi\u00e9n escucha bastante bien cuando hablas desde el reloj. Tienes la opci\u00f3n de a\u00f1adir contactos con dibujos que ayudan mucho al ni\u00f1o a identificar quien es, aunque no sepa leer. Hay un padre, una madre, un abuelo, una abuela, entre otros personajes f\u00e1ciles de identificar. Est\u00e1 genial por si el ni\u00f1o quiere hacer \u00e9l una llamada usando los contactos. Tambi\u00e9n tiene un bot\u00f3n de SOS al que puedes asignar un contacto para que llame.El reloj viene con una c\u00e1mara frontal muy sencillita (seguramente con calidad VGA o poco m\u00e1s) y como est\u00e1 en la mu\u00f1eca, es muy dificil sacar una foto tipo selfie que se aproveche porque est\u00e1 demasiado cerca. Mi hijo est\u00e1 encantado con ella, que es lo importante. Adem\u00e1s, tambi\u00e9n tiene en el lateral derecho una linterna que la puedes encender en los ajustes y esa s\u00ed tiene una orientaci\u00f3n que est\u00e1 genial si llevas el reloj en la mano izquierda, porque se queda se\u00f1alando delante y tiene bastante brillo, la verdad.Como funciones interesantes, tiene lo tipico de cron\u00f3metro, despertador, cuenta atr\u00e1s, pero tambi\u00e9n tiene muchas cosas que ese tipo de relojes no tienen como: calculadora, varios juegos que est\u00e1n muy bien (aunque chupan la bater\u00eda super rapido) , grabadora de voz y otras cosas. Tambi\u00e9nHablando de la bater\u00eda, en el primer dia, no dur\u00f3 nada porque el ni\u00f1o pas\u00f3 todo el tiempo jugando con la c\u00e1mara, con los juegos, y a\u00fan as\u00ed despu\u00e9s de unas tres horas, ten\u00eda unos 50% a\u00fan, pero hay que tener en cuenta que no llevaba tarjeta sim a\u00fan, porque a\u00fan no queremos que lo lleve de continuo. Supongo que durar\u00e1 un d\u00eda entero bien con la sim puesta, pero no creo que dure m\u00e1s que eso. Es un reloj para cargar todos los d\u00edas.Creo que es una buena opci\u00f3n para tener alguna manera de contactar a un ni\u00f1o sin darle un m\u00f3vil en la mano, ya que internet es un ambiente muy complicado para ni\u00f1os tan peque\u00f1os. De momento, nos parece interesante como alternativa al m\u00f3vil.",
            "Bewertet wird hier die Smartwatch von PTHTECHUS, welche von dem Hersteller als Smartwatch f\u00fcr Kinder beworben wird.Mitgeliefert wird neben der Uhr noch ein Ladekabel.Die Uhr ist komplett us Kunststoff und hat ein Silikonarmband.Als erstes muss ich sagen, das die Smartwatch recht klobig ist.In meinen Augen zu klobig f\u00fcr einen Kinderarm.Ich w\u00fcrde sie als passend f\u00fcr meinen Arm einstufen.An dem Arm eines 6 j\u00e4hrigen Jungen wirkt sie viel zu klobig.Schaltet man die Uhr das erste mal ein, erscheint der Schriftzug \"Hello\" und eine kurze Melodie ert\u00f6nt.Unter Einstellungen muss die Sprache erst einmal auf Deutsch gestellt werden - Lieferzustand ist Englisch.Auch wenn man Deutsch als Systemsprache gew\u00e4hlt hat, bleiben z. B. die Anleitungen zu den Spielen auf Englisch und werden nicht \u00fcbersetzt.Die Spiele selbst sind optisch und akustisch sehr einfach gehalten und nicht vergleichbar mit Spielen f\u00fcr ein Smartphone.Die Steuerung geschieht mit antippen des Bildschirmes. Wischgesten werden in den Spielen nicht unterst\u00fctzt.Die beiden Kameras schie\u00dfen Bilder in VGA und die aufgenommenen Fotos erinnern von der Qualit\u00e4t her an die ersten Handykameras.Es gibt einen Video Player und einen Musikplayer. Mitdiesen kann man auf der SD Card Musik anh\u00f6ren.Weiterhin ist eine Taschenlampe, welche im Men\u00fc als Fackel bezeichnet wird, eingebaut.Um die Telefonfunktion nutzen zu k\u00f6nnen, muss selbstverst\u00e4ndlich eine Sim Karte eingelegt werden.Leider kann ich die Smartwatch von PTHTECHUS nicht empfehlen.Zum einen ist sie f\u00fcr Kinderarme zu klobig, zum anderen scheint die verbaute Technik veraltet.Auch die Englischen Spiel\u00fcbersetzungen, welche sich nicht \u00fcbersetzen lassen, sind ein Ausschlusskriterium, da kleinere Kinder noch kein Englisch verstehen.Nat\u00fcrlich handelt es sich hier um ein Produkt f\u00fcr unter 40 Euro, allerdings taugt die Uhr nicht wirklich als Smartwatch, da auf Bluetooth oder Wifi verzichtet wurde.",
            "F\u00fcr knapp 40,00 Euro eine Smartwatch zu bekommen in die man sogar eine Nano-Sim einsetzen kann und die nicht mit einem Smartphon gekoppelt werden muss nicht schon der Hammer.Das Silikonarmband ist weich und angenehm zu tragen, die gesamte Uhr grade einmal 40 Gramm schwer.Neben vorinstallierten Spielen gibt es auch eine Reihe n\u00fctzlicher Apps, wie einem Rechner, eine Kamera und eine Taschenlampe. Man kann Musik abspielen und sogar Videos, Kontakte speichern, Telefonieren und Radio h\u00f6ren.Die Selfie Kamera wird sicher das Highlight werden!Als Besonderheit gibt es eine S.O.S Taste falls das Kind mal in Schwierigkeiten kommen sollte und schnell jemanden anrufen muss.Der 400 Milliampere gro\u00dfe Akku wird wohl nicht ewig halten, aber das h\u00e4ngt ja auch vom Spieltrieb des Nutzers ab. Geladen wird die Uhr \u00fcber ein Micro-USB -Kabel welches der Lieferung beigelegt ist.auf die Zugabe eines Netzteils wurde verzichtet.Da ich diese Smartwatch nicht in erster Linie als wirkliche Vertreterin ihrer Art ansehe sondern als Mittel die Kinder fr\u00fchzeitig an die moderne Art der Kommunikation heranzuf\u00fchren, vergebe ich trotz einiger, bei diesem Preis auch zu erwartenden Schw\u00e4chen volle 5 Sterne.Eine Nano-Sim kann man auch gleich mitbestellen unter:amazon.de/WhatsApp-SIM-Prepaid-Micro-SIM-Nano-SIM/dp/B00KPPNBWEMit dieser Karte haben wir gute Erfahrungen gemacht.",

            "It amazes me how far technology has come in certain segments of the market.  This is a wrist-wearable computer with a built in fully independent cell phone, camera, video recorder, video player, music player and basic games console.  How they can fit all that in something this small and sell it for under 50 dollars is astounding and something I think most people take for granted.As a smart watch aimed at kids there's not much to complain about here.  It tells the time, has lots of fun things to do and as I said, it is in fact a self-contained cell phone, so you can reach your child by calling them and they can call home in an emergency.  However, it did not work with my sim card which is on the Public Mobile network.The music player is fun and the built in speaker is quite loud for a watch, but there is no bluetooth, so using this to listen to music through headphones is not possible.  The camera quality is bad and the lens' field of view is extremely narrow, but small kids will probably think this is amazing.  The manufacturer claims it takes HD photos.  It doesn't.  It takes very tiny photos with a resolution of 240x240 pixels. The display is more responsive than I expected at this price and it's bright too.  The games are very simple but 5 year olds will love them and find them easy to learn.I love that there is no setup process, no need to create an account, pair to a phone or download an app in order to use this.  It's a complete, ready to use device.",

F\u00fcr Kindre ist sie aber gut genug.Die Akkulaufzeit betr\u00e4gt ca. 4 Tage.Meine Nichte hat sich wirklich sehr \u00fcber die Uhr gefreut und spielt gerne damit.

Il touch, non sempre responsivo e che tende spesso ad inchiodarsi.2. Alcune funzioni sembrano essere state messe cos\u00ec per fare \"volume\".3. Se utilizzato in maniera stressante (come ci si aspetta da un bambino) la batteria non arriver\u00e0 a fine giornata.*DA SAPERE*Gli MP3 vanno inseriti nella cartella \"My Music\" altrimenti lo smartwatch non sar\u00e0 in grado di leggerli e riprodurli.PERCH\u00c9 SI:1. spedizione fulminea.2. Rapida ed immediata la funzione SOS.3. Cinturino morbido, resistente e di qualit\u00e0 accettabile.4. Tanti giochini per passare il tempo.5.

            "Recientemente, he designado a mi hijo peque\u00f1o como probador de este smartwatch para ni\u00f1os que Amazon me invit\u00f3 a probar.Comenzar\u00e9 se\u00f1alando que el producto me lleg\u00f3 a mi domicilio perfectamente precintado.Con una presentaci\u00f3n buena, tanto la serigrafia como el dise\u00f1o del propio smartwatch denota que claramente est\u00e1 destinado a un cliente infantil. Concretamente, el fabricante recomienda que la franja de edad potencialmente usuario de este producto la sit\u00faa entre los cuatro y los doce a\u00f1os.En cuanto a su calidad de materiales, teniendo en cuenta su precio algo inferior cuarenta euros, he de decir que, a pesar de que atesora robustez, considero que la calidad de su correa es algo mejorable. Fabricada en silicona, he de decir que a esta correa tiene una elasticidad mejorable, aspecto este que acaba penalizando en la comodidad de este smartwatch.Trat\u00e1ndose de un smartwatch infantil, ofrece divertidas e interesantes funciones como juegos, calculadora, medidor de pasos e incluso una funci\u00f3n SOS.Posee una pantalla t\u00e1ctil a color, con buena visibilidad y sensibilidad. En cuanto a su visibilidad, he de decir que se ha comprobado a cualquier momento del d\u00eda, gracias en parte a su brillo y contraste de calidad.Permite la inserci\u00f3n de una SIM, haciendo que puedan realizarse llamadas. Ahora bien, el fabricante indica que esta SIM solo admite la red 2G, aspecto que ya limita su funcionalidad.En cuanto a su autonom\u00eda, llegando a durar su bater\u00eda interna poco menos de un d\u00eda antes de requerir una nueva recarga, he de criticar que el fabricante haya escogido para su recarga la utilizaci\u00f3n de una obsoleta entrada microUSB, formato que hoy d\u00eda ya se encuentra en desuso.En cuanto a mi experiencia de uso, he de decir que su manejo es sencillo e intuitivo, a pesar de que el fabricante ha incluido el espa\u00f1ol entre los idiomas disponibles de su manual de instrucciones.El men\u00fa, colorido y vistoso, funciona de forma fluida, sin lags.Por todo lo comentado, teniendo en cuenta el precio de este smartwatch y el tipo de usuario al que esta destinado, considero que su funcionalidad es correcta, haciendo que su manejo sea fluido a la vez que divertido para los m\u00e1s peques, aunque destaco que tienen algunos aspectos a mejorar.",

De hecho en 2025 se producir\u00e1 el apag\u00f3n total de las mismas, con lo que los dispositivos que utilizan aun hoy estas redes se ver\u00e1n totalmente inutilizados e inservibles.Este reloj permite utilizar una SIM pero s\u00f3lo funciona bajo Red 2G, por lo que sus funciones como tel\u00e9fono tienen como limitaci\u00f3n la existencia de cobertura de esta red en su zona de uso y en 2025 dejara de funcionar dicha red, quedando por tanto \u00fanicamente funcionales desee esa fecha el resto de caracter\u00edsticas del reloj:Linterna, calculadora, juegos, reproductor de mp3, c\u00e1mara, pod\u00f3metro\u2026Quitando ese problema, es por sus aplicaciones y por la pantalla t\u00e1ctil de 1.44 pulgadas a todo color, donde el reloj destaca bastante, y se ve francamente pr\u00e1ctico.En cuanto a autonom\u00eda, tiene una bater\u00eda interna de 400mAh, que se carga mediante conexi\u00f3n micro USB. Se adjunta un cable USB tipo A a micro USB para este fin, pero no el transformador de corriente.Mi valoracion es de 3\u2b50, por la limitaci\u00f3n en cuanto a usar la red 2G, y por el hecho de que no parece un reloj demasiado resistente al agua. La tapa trasera para acceder al tarjetero SIM y a la bater\u00eda no tiene ninguna goma de protecci\u00f3n para evitar la entrada de l\u00edquidos, es m\u00e1s, la tapa adem\u00e1s se puede retirar sin ning\u00fan esfuerzo, por lo que adem\u00e1s si se cae al suelo, esta saldr\u00e1 despedida con toda probabilidad.Si te ha ayudado mi valoraci\u00f3n, dame un \"\u00fatil \", lo agradecer\u00e9.",
            "Era da qualche settimana che mia figlia di 8 anni mi chideva un orologio digitale oppure uno smartwatch quindi ho colto l'occasione per provare questo dispositivo del brand PTHTECHUS. \u00c8 arrivato in una scatolina piuttosto misera e, a mio parere, non adatta ad un prodotto del genere... Seppur specificato che \u00e8 uno smartwatch per bambini avrei preferito una confezione pi\u00f9 presentabile e tendente al mondo tech anche in merito ad un ipotetico regalo da fare... In tal senso devo dire che non ci siamo. Aprendo la confezione troviamo lo smartwatch, un cavetto micro usb per la ricarica, un manuale utente multilingua, italiano compreso e, in fine, un talloncino indicante il custom service. Al tatto il dispositivo si presenta ben realizzato anche se la qualit\u00e0 dei materiali \u00e8 molto semplice ma c'\u00e8 comunque da tenere a mente l'importo a cui viene proposto. Il cinturino, in silicone, \u00e8 morbido e abbastanza comodo al polso. Lo smartwatch ha un design tutto sommato semplice e squadrato con un quadrante abbastanza grande e un diaplay altrettanto generoso e di discreta fattura... Il touch non \u00e8 male, me lo aspettavo peggio. Sui lati troviamo la porta micro usb per la ricarica della batteria integrata da 400mah, un sensore e un tasto SOS che funziona solo se inseriamo sul retro dello smartwatch una sim in formato nano. Per accedere al suddetto vano sim va rimosso lo sportellino sul retro dove troviamo anche una piccola cassa audio. Per ci\u00f2 che riguarda le funzionalit\u00e0 lo trovo piuttosto basico e adatto al pubblico dei pi\u00f9 piccoli ma tenderei a partire da un et\u00e0 di almeno 6 anni viste le diverse funzionalit\u00e0 disponibili. Abbiamo l'orario ovviamente, con diversi quadranti da poter scegliere, poi abbiamo la sveglia, contapassi, calendario, giochi, registratore vocale, musica, video e persino una piccola fotocamera posta in alto sul display... Avevo dimenticato di citarla prima. Non \u00e8 un granch\u00e9, sia chiaro, ma mia figlia si diverte comunque. Stesso discorso vale anche per il contapassi che ad ogni lieve spostamento calcola passi di massa.. \u00c8 sicuramente un device senza troppe pretese ma che funziona piuttosto bene per i pi\u00f9 piccoli. La batteria dura un paio di giorni e credo sia un buon risultato. Il rapporto qualit\u00e0 prezzo lo trovo giusto e in linea con ci\u00f2 che offre questo prodotto anche se la disponibilit\u00e0 di un coupon sarebbe sicuranente gradita",
            "Los smart watch de ni\u00f1os son aparentemente como los de adultos pero no: est\u00e1n especialmente pensados para ellos: para los padres, que se los pongan a sus hijos y se encuentren m\u00e1s relajados. Porque as\u00ed tendr\u00e1n controlados a los menores all\u00e1 donde vayan.Este reloj inteligente es de un color azul vistoso, una pantalla que se ve bastante bien y queda un poco grande en los ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os (a uno de 12 a\u00f1os le queda mejor que a uno de 4 a\u00f1os). Es divertido para ellos porque les encanta cacharrear con la tecnolog\u00eda y tiene para hacer fotos o v\u00eddeos, juegos, pod\u00f3metro, temporizador, linterna, despertador, calculadora y hasta m\u00fasica.Pero vayamos con las caracter\u00edsticas que tiene para los padres: puedes meter una tarjeta sim (que no viene incluida) para tener controlado al menor y poder llamarle o que \u00e9l te llame, incluso un bot\u00f3n de socorro que al final acabar\u00e1 activando el ni\u00f1o sin darse cuenta alguna vez que otra sin darse cuenta, pero no est\u00e1 de m\u00e1s. As\u00ed los pap\u00e1s estar\u00e1n tranquilos. Me parece interesante la opci\u00f3n de que durante las horas de clase se pueda desconectar para que los ni\u00f1os no se entretengan con los juegos. A\u00fan as\u00ed, las llamadas de emergencia seguir\u00e1n funcionando.No hace falta bajarse ninguna aplicaci\u00f3n ni tener que llevarlo junto a un m\u00f3vil, por lo que es una ventaja con respecto a los relojes inteligentes tradicionales. La sim va en el propio reloj por lo que no hay que darle un m\u00f3vil a tu hijo. Se conecta al ordenador por la entrada USB y as\u00ed se transfieren las fotos, v\u00eddeos y m\u00fasica. Se pueden guardar hasta 10 contactos para que ellos tambi\u00e9n tengan a mano una agenda telef\u00f3nica.La bater\u00eda no dura mucho, hay que ir carg\u00e1ndola bastante m\u00e1s que otros relojes que he tenido, aunque depende de lo que se use. Tampoco es resistente al agua como otros. S\u00ed que me gusta el dise\u00f1o mucho m\u00e1s que otros porque el orificio de la c\u00e1mara es muy sutil.Lo recomiendo para ni\u00f1os que no sean muy peque\u00f1os y quiz\u00e1 para padres que quieran dejar un poco de libertad a sus hijos en determinados momentos teniendo la seguridad de que van a poder localizarlo incluso cuando el ni\u00f1o o ni\u00f1a a\u00fan no disponga de m\u00f3vil.",

Der interne Speicher can mit bis zu 16GB micro-SD Speicher erweitert werden, leider muss man die Uhr aufmachen daf\u00fcr.Insgesamt ist es ein gutes Produkt und ich empfehle es zu kaufen.",

            "This watch says that it utilizes a sim card with 2g service. This service is nearly dead everywhere. The sim card area in the watch is a little tricky to figure out. You have to open the back and then lift up the battery slightly. The sim card slot is located under the battery. You have to slide(left/right) and lift up the metal sim card cover like a door. Insert the sim card and lay the metal cover down over it and slide it into place to lock it. This watch is not waterproof. The watch works as specified except for the 2g calling. 2g service is not available in my area, so make sure you check if your area still has it. You have to buy your own sim card and they recommend Speedtalk service. Check their coverage map for 2g service.",
            "This watch is really great!  She loves it but as you can see in the picture it is bigger than an adult watch.  But even though it is kinda big it was a big hit with her.  She loved that it even played music;)"

            "The watch is beautiful. Bought it for my girlfriend and she loved it. I cannot find a nicer looking smartwatch anywhere else, especially for those with a small wrist.The functionality is also pretty good. Has all that's needed.The only issue for us was the battery life. It's really bad. Not sure if our unit was faulty or if that's how they designed it, but it barely lasted 2 days. Even with pulseox turned off and minimal notifications etc.. it got nowhere near the advertised 5 days.Worse yet is when you go for an exercise. Tried it a few times and it goes from 60-70 percent to dead in less than half an hour!!Making this fitness watch useless for fitness!How is it that my cheap Chinese mi band, that does pretty much the same thing and weighs about the same, lasts 3 weeks? And this one struggles to stay on for a 1 hour bike ride?Surprisingly none of the reviews I found online mention that, so there is a chance that our unit was faulty. We returned it anyway and bought a cheap mi band that works.Hope Garmin makes an improvement on that in the next model.",
            "Overall I love this watch, love the looks, the form factor/size, the clear display, has all the functionality I need, Battery life is decent. The only caveat (and a BIG one!!) is that it regularly dies, goes unresponsive during walking, not only when I record a walk but also when I just walk outside for more than 5 min. The only way to get it back to 'life' is to connect it to your PC which is a pain. Also it sometimes just does not count the steps. I really hope they can solve this bug with a software update as apart from that I really like it and do not want to give it back, but if it keeps dying I will have to ... :-(",
            "I wanted 2 things in a fitness watch. To count steps & to get texts/notifications from my phone, The steps are ok I think, but notifications are hit and miss. Very frustrating. Sometimes I will have my phone in my hand and the text won\u2019t show on lily. Would NOT recommend this. My 4+ year old Fitbit is more reliable. Rubbish product.",

            "Me gust\u00f3 todo de este reloj, el tama\u00f1o sus funciones es muy c\u00f3modo y me ayuda a darle un seguimiento a mi entrenamiento.... Adem\u00e1s la app de Garmin es muy completa, no tuve ning\u00fan problema para vincularlo con mi cel. En fin de las mejores compras en cuanto a este tipo de equipos.",
            "When I was buying it, I knew that features-wise Lily is not as good as my other Garmin watch, Solar instinct. So for the features Lily comes with, it is the best.Battery was an issue, it lasted for only 2 days maximum. But after the software update and after turning off the sleep SpO2 tracking, it's good.Charging is fast.Connecting to the Android & iOS apps like Garmin connect, MyFitnessPal, etc is simple and smooth.The strap isn't purple, it's more of greyish aubergine. Quality of the silicon strap is good. The display is good on a bright day as well. Though it has menstrual tracking and is marketed as a women's watch, it can be worn by men too.",
            "I really loved this watch - the size and the features but it kept freezing so I had to return it.The watch froze 3 times in the first 48 hours of wearing it. From reading other product reviews, this seems to be a common malfunction where the watch screen freezes when trying to run an activity. The problem I had was that an activity automatically starts when you walk for 10mins or more (this can be adjusted in settings) then the screen will freeze and there is no reset button so you can only reset the watch by plugging it in to charge. So, I'd walk to the station in the morning and the watch would freeze then I can't use it again all day till I'm home to plug it in.This is the second garmin watch that I've bought and returned with the same problem - the first being the vivosmart 4.Really lovely watch but absolutely useless because of the freezing.",
            "I\u2019ve had Garmin activity trackers for many years and this is the fourth style. They\u2019ve been durable and reliable. The Lily is so pretty and very easy to highlight the widgets I want. The watch face is small and is more feminine than other activity trackers. Garmin support is the best if you have questions Or problems. The Lily is my favorite so far..Highly recommend!!!",
            "I loved the look of this watch and couldn't wait to wear it in replace of an old Garmin watch I had. I was excited about having a fitness tracking watch that looked like a nicer watch to wear. I bought the watch about three weeks ago. Lily worked well for the first couple of weeks but I started to notice connection issues pretty quickly. It would often tell me that the watch needed phone connection (in order to view some of the apps and info on the phone) when I had paired it from the get go. The bluetooth connection would drop multiple times during the day. Then this past week the watch just started to freeze. It would not wake to tapping on the screen or when raising my wrist. Nothing would revive it, even trying to charge it. I'm so disappointed and I'm returning it unfortunately.",
            "This was a gift for someone with a smaller wrist. Looks gorgeous and not like normal wearable tech, however, lots of issues connecting to the iPhone, you must update it as soon as you get it. Sometimes it is unresponsive when tapping the screen and needs to be plugged into Garmin Express to function. Other than those (major) issues its a nice piece of kit! If you have the patience it might be worth it! ;)",
            "El reloj lo compr\u00e9 en agosto, estamos en noviembre y de la nada al tener 38% de bater\u00eda se apag\u00f3, se desconfigur\u00f3 de la hora, y la f\u00bfpantalla ahora muestra replicado el % de bater\u00eda. La pantalla f\u00edsicamente est\u00e1 bien, sin rasgaduras o roturas, nunca se ha mojado. Para ser un reloj de este precio y que se descomponga en 3 meses es una verg\u00fcenza. lo prob\u00e9 cambiando varias pantallas y en todas muestra el mismo error. Ese error muestra desde la sincronizaci\u00f3n con un iPhone.",
            "Fue para un regalo para una adolescente, le encant\u00f3, esta hermoso y peque\u00f1o, con todas las funcionalidades que tiene no termina de usarlas todas. Excelente producto, vale cada peso que cost\u00f3.",
            "Es muy f\u00e1cil de utilizar pero hay que bajar una aplicaci\u00f3n para configurarlo y para que vaya haciendo el registro de todas las actividades, pero es muy sencillo. La primera vez que lo usas para hacer ejercicio se va deteniendo y eso puede ser molesto, pero una vez configur\u00e1ndolo no hay problema. Yo lo utilizo para nadar y para andar en bici, pero hay que tener siempre el celular cerca porque necesita el GPS de la aplicaci\u00f3n. La pila le dura bastante tiempo. Se configura bien con iPhone, recibe mensajes, llamadas y puedes cambiarle a la m\u00fasica desde el reloj",
            "Easy to understand  and set with touchscreen  option.  Since I have  problems with my hands, this option was really important.  I love it.",
            "I returned mine as it was too glitchy. I was less then 10 feet away from my phone and it would vibrate saying \u2018not connected\u2019 to saying \u2019connected\u2019 and would keep going back and forth.The touch button on the face watch only would work half the time. It was a very nice looking watch though.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0Lo que se me ha hecho dificil es la programaci\u00f3n como tal al sincronizarle con la app telefonica, de hecho a\u00fan no ha quedado al 100 pero pero para lo que lo uso sin problema\ud83d\ude0a"

            "After trying out a number of different watches I'm really happy with the Garmin overall.Features are great. I get everything I want from it and more. Still getting used to the different buttons and there are a few things I'd like to add but I'm sure overtime I will find them.My only complaint is that the charger didn't work so after a coupe of days the battery ran out and I couldn't charge it. I borrowed a charger from a friend to see if it was an issue with the charger or the watch itself and it seems it was the charger.When I spoke to a customer service representative from Amazon they said they could not send out a replacement charger and could only refund me ~ $10 so that I could purchase a replacement charger myself. However replacement chargers are $40 so it doesn't cover the cost. They said the only other alternative was to send the watch back for a full refund. But sending the watch back for a full refund would also cost me money in postage and insurance not to mention it took 6 weeks for me to receive the watch in the first place so would likely be another 6 weeks to then order another watch.The representative I spoke to from Amazon was a bit rude and hostile while we were discussing options to rectify the problem. I felt they didn't make much of an effort at all to help with the situation. Just kept saying that Amazon would lose money if they were to send a replacement charger or to compensate for the cost of a new charger and that I should be grateful they were even offering a refund. They only seemed to care about the money and didn't seem to care that they had send a faulty product to begin with.",
            "I have been wearing Garmin fitness trackers/watches for about 6 years. I like everything about the vivoactive4s in terms of what it can do and how it looks. It is great that workouts can be stored and there is the freedom of not having to take your phone for music.And the smaller size also makes it a quite attractive dress piece. Yes I do like it a lot.",
            "I bought this watch to check my hearth rate during activities but unfortunately although I like the battery life, the hearth rate is completely inaccurate. When I do an high intensity training activity my heart rate is around 160 bpm but the watch shows 100-110 bpm. It's a complete disappointment. I really like to return this watch if I can.",
            "Love this watch so much. It is super stylish (and I bought myself a replacement wristband). The Garmin connect app has so much great and USEFUL data that syncs with this. Some of the features I love:- Garmin pay (I put it as the shortcut option and use it constantly)- Customisable watch face- Get up and move reminders- Insights: such as we've noticed a pattern that you don't get many steps in on a Friday, try be active tomorrow!- Beautiful design, with the replacement wristband it doesn't look like a fit watch so I can wear it to work, at functions, and at the gym.",
            "Great watch. Functions as you would expect it to given it's description. Battery life is fair considering it is worn 24/7. Looks good. Has lasted several months now & this watch is worn as a tradie (my husband) on the tools all day. Easy to keep the rubber band clean. Looks good too. Thank you.",
            "I have been using this watch for 8 months and I love the look of it and the different features.It's definetely good quality for money and the support from Garmin is pretty good.Only negative comments I would have is the sleep monitoring is pretty inaccurate.",
            "It was fine for the first month or so but now it will not connect to my phone and I cannot find any wifi connections through the app or watch very disappointing as it was very expensive and it\u2019s frustrating that I cannot wear it anymore due to no connection",
            "Loving the Garmin vivoactive 4s.  Great variety of activities listed. Easy to use. Love the look of the watch particularly the watch rose coloured face. Great purchase. Would recommend.",
            "Takes a bit of getting used to if you haven't had a smart watch before. But this watch has been awesome. Really good connectivity to phone, great tracking and I've loved the preloaded workouts",
            "Will never buy Garmin again doesn't track intensity minutes or sleep correctly, you also need to buy apps to use what are standard excersizes  (Hiit , skipping). A total waste of money . Beware."

            "I deliberately waited a couple of weeks to review this tracker watch as I wanted to test it out first.PROs:It looks great on your wrist.  I have a fairly thin wrist but it doesn't look oversized at all.It seems to track steps pretty accurately.The battery lasts about 6-7 days for me, but I don't have it connected to bluetooth constantly and I don't have the heart rate monitor on 24/7.  I do these things only when necessary so am assuming battery would run out much quicker otherwise.The app is pretty easy to navigate.You can pick pretty much whichever clock face suits your style or design your own (with a few limitations)CONs:You can set up to three different alarms, but mine only work for about 4 days then change their own mind to vibrate whenever the watch pleases!  I only have one alarm set per day, everyday, however this watch changes to 3.30pm, 11.30pm or nothing at all despite me making no changes on the app.The watch face is changed via the app however if it is lit and you accidentally have something pressed on the face it allows you to change back to two different default faces.  This happens by accident a lot.  Simply by crossing your arms or leaning on your leg can cause the face to change - this is a pain.  You should be able to lock it or change it via the app only.You can't change the order of how you see the main functions.  I bought this to keep track of my steps but you have to scroll through other pages to see that number, it would be great if you could change the order according to your own needs.The date is only in American format, so as an Aussie you have to either find a face that doesn't put it in mm/dd/yy format or just remember it is backwards!All-in-all it's just OK.  I can't say it's great but I can't say it's bad either.  If the alarm function and locking the clock face was available it would definitely go up in my rating.",
            "I don't want to start the review off with a negative comment,  so I'll say what a great little watch. I bought two at the same time. Space grey for hubby, rose gold for me. Both are supposed to be the same watch, just different colours. While my watch is fabulous with heart rate monitoring, Blood Pressure and oxygen levels, as well as a myriad of activities I can't say the same for my husbands. His only takes heart rate. He also has activities, but given his age, I was wanting the blood pressure and oxygen levels also. No, rose gold doesn't fit him, so we're not swapping.For that reason we both feel disappointed with his watch. Especially when they are the exact same product just different colours.",
            "No even worth the time to return it. Absolute trash of a product. Absolutely feral design. Please send this back to hell or Wish.I am genuinely thinking about giving Amazon a bad rating because this product should no be on this platform.Photos are close to decieving to not show anywhere that the screen is square. UX on the menu will make children cry. Unusable touch screen. Battery life no where near 15 days advertised...Where do I get more than a refund?Yes it does probably measure heart rate, or something. I couldn't tell you how accurately it would. But the screen, product design, and UX design is absolutely trash... Not worth the time it took me to sort out a very simple amazon return. Can't understand how it is worth everyone working for this company's time...",
            "Watch  description says it includes as good function, the assumption was that I could answer phone with watch function.. this is not the case , the function only advises o fc as call coming to to your phone. ALSO alarm function is just a vibrate and the vibrate is not very loud( not great)Overall the watch is great and stylish, very comfortable to wear.. but some functions do not come to the expectations.",
            "Had it for less than a week, but so far it's ticking all the boxes! I LOVE that I can customise the face to really personalise it \ud83d\ude0dAlso love the price tag \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb It has a great battery life and looks/feels very high quality.It finds my phone (every other hour \ud83d\ude02), can take remote photos, play/pause my music & podcasts.Yes, it has a square lit face, but that's not a deal breaker for me.I'm very impressed. It's awesome!",
            "Excellent value for money! Tracks my steps and workouts. Keeps a record of my heart rates throughout the day which matches my BP monitor result (so quite accurate!). Also keeps a record of distances and daily heart rate so you can see a pattern.Battery lasts up to 10 days with all the features working well. Only takes 1\u20195h to recharge.I personally think it looks really good considering is a \u201csport watch\u201d the finishes on the sphere and the fact that is circular instead of rectangular (like in other models) gives it a bit of a more sophisticated look (I bought the pink one).App for iPhone is very user friendly and has all you you expect from it.",
            "I love the large face and wide wristband and the watch has more than enough features for me. I have a small wrist and still like the size of the watch face. My only slight criticism is that it would be nicer if the watch was a little slimmer (I.e. thickness). Otherwise great watch.",
            "Love the watch but when I tried to download the app to connect to my Samsung s10+, my phone started to do weird things like I couldn't call anybody on my contacts list or even my voicemail. Everything would come up on my phone screen but there was no ringing, I texted my grandson to ring me and I could get calls but couldn't make any. I was worried I case I had to call emergency number and the call wouldn't work so I u installed the app. I will reinstall it at a later date and check the phone before I give any 'permissions' in the app and see how that works. The watch works great and am so pleased with it as a health watch.",
            "The watch is super cheap and on first look and feel it felt like a real bargain. It\u2019s packed full of features you can customise the watch face and seemed a good looking smart watch. Having used it for a week before requesting a refund the following became apparent1. It no good in sun light - the screen cannot be seen when the sun light hits it2. It has no integration to Strava, you can track your activities but it is all stored via it\u2019s only little app3. It\u2019s not waterproof. The watch claimed to not track swimming but could be used for swimming. The plan was to use the stop watch to time laps. Touch screen does not work when wet and the screen broke and kept defaulting to a settings screen.The best thing was the super swift response and refund from Amazon.",
            "As this is the first digital workout type watch I've purchased, I was unfamiliar with how to set it up and as usual these days the instructions are a tad short of info. But I muddled my way through it and finally got it working ok. I really like the plethora of watch faces that can be downloaded. However, there are 4 watch face in the memory and you can only change the 4th (last) one. The other 3 seemed locked in and the Customise one is not much good as the colors are just a single color for everything. Overall I think the watch is brilliant for only a mere $42, you can't knock that price and it has all the features of much more expensive workout watches.",
            "Wow for $39 I wasn't expecting anything really great but this smart watch is fantastic! The fact i can read my sms etc is awesome. Plus all the fitness readers. Great entry point if you want a smart watch to see if like it before spending the big bucks.",
            "I bought this watch on a bit of a whim and am very impressed after a couple of weeks of use.It's easy to use and has terrific battery life. The HR monitor is accurate when refenced against a pulse oximeter. The choice of clock faces is quite broad, though it would be nice to have more analogue variants.I've made use of almost all the functions and they are easy to find and use, particularly the find my phone button!This is my first smart watch and without having experience with the more expensive brands am happy with my purchase.",
            "I thought I'd hit the jack pot when I received my watch. I never wanted anything over the top just the basics. This watch does just that and the price is on point. It syncs nicely with IOS and Android.  However, it stopped charging and did not switch on even after long charge periods.I contacted the supplier and they were very helpful and replaced the watch within days.. I now have new watch and hope to continue.",
            "Just had the package delivered, have not even turned on the watch but this watch has so many scratches on one side as seen in the photos. I was expecting a brand new watch but that's not what I received. They sent us a damaged watch so not recommended.",
            "Not even worth the $40. Battery life is less than a day. I've had a few weeks and it has unsyced from my phone and now doesn't even tell the time correctly. It says it's linked to the phone. Restarting it just resets the time to midnight. I can't get into the menu now either.  It literally is just a pedometer now.",
            "Exactly the same as a Fitbit but a fraction on the price! has all the same features, with the bonus of being waterproof. Only thing I would change is that even though the face is round the screen itself is square but it\u2019s not a deal breaker! Love being able to customise the background! Would purchase again and again & as gifts!",
            "This is a great little watch with basic features at a great price. I'm not sure it's overly accurate with sleep but records my steps, calories burnt and heart rate which is enough for me. The display is clear and easy to read and the battery lasts about a week. Very good price which makes it an appealing entry level product.",
            "I was liking this watch well enough even with the screen being a little dim and the weirdness of the square screen on a round face, but after two months, the screen has gone so dim that I can only see it in a completely dark room, and the reset through the phone has not made the screen readable again. :(",
            "Watch arrived next day after order (excellent work Amazon). Good quality packaging (like Apple).  Now 2 days later watch meets expectations, great display, functions etc.",
            "My son saved up his money to buy this and less than 2 months later it is now broken. There's no way to contact the seller and return for a refund. Surely a $50 watch should last longer than 2 months.",
            "I received my umidigi watching this week . I was so happy to see my watch but my happiness was not for long when I realized that it's battery dies with in four hours even I reduce the brightness.  I don't know what to do. I will appreciate your help in this matter.Regards,Jaspreet Kaur",
            "It is claimed to be a waterproof watch however inthe accompanying literature states not to be used in salt water as we live near the ocean was the one reason the watch was purchased and I guess this review is computer generated and is such is a waste of time!!!",
            "In less than 6 months I am having trouble charging my watch.

            "So far so good . Easy set up . I have a very skinny arm and feel its a bit large but when I see other people with similar watches it looks okay. Easy to read haven't worked everything out yet. 3 day delivery excellant!",
            "I've swapped from an apple watch that only lasted 3/4 of a day, to being able to ignore this watch for weeks without needing to charge it. Its got all the functions I need and no extra bloat so its perfect for me.",
            "It comes with all the functions advertised on the page. The spo2 reading takes about 30 seconds, but it matches with the other finger sp02 device I have. Customising watch face is \"addictive\". Overall I am happy about the product.",

            "Unfortunately, I'm disappointed. I'm not sure if my watch is faulty but battery only lasts 3-4 days and sleep tracking is completely off - it's like a guessing game. Otherwise it's ok basic smart watch.",

            "Amazfit Bip SL\u00e1 vem text\u00e3o, mas acho que se voc\u00ea est\u00e1 interessado no Amazfit Bip S, pode ser \u00fatil. Comprei o modelo no dia 25/10/2020, e foi entregue como combinado, menos de uma semana depois. Nunca tive um smartwatch, embora seja um entusiasta da tecnologia h\u00e1 anos e acompanhe lan\u00e7amentos, reviews, comparativos etc. com bastante aten\u00e7\u00e3o. Embora quisesse um Apple Watch desde o lan\u00e7amento do primeiro modelo, com o tempo percebi que o Apple Watch entregaria para mim um conjunto muito maior de funcionalidades do que eu realmente precisaria: n\u00e3o me interesso por notifica\u00e7\u00f5es de mensagens, usar um smartwatch para ouvir m\u00fasica, ou atender a chamadas telef\u00f4nicas. Al\u00e9m disso, o pre\u00e7o de um Apple Watch (mesmo trazido de fora por algum conhecido) \u00e9 muito alto para mim. Procurava, na verdade, por um smartwatch que mostrasse as horas, a data, contasse passos, tivesse GPS integrado, fizesse uma leitura minimamente precisa dos batimentos card\u00edacos e me permitisse mapear aspectos gerais da minha sa\u00fade, seja pelo sono, seja pelo lado das atividades esportivas. Depois de muito pesquisar, encontrei o Amazfit Bip S e gostei muito do produto at\u00e9 o momento. Ele \u00e9 muito simples na constru\u00e7\u00e3o e no uso, leve, tem uma tela que usa a luz ambiente para refletir os dados, gastando quase nada de bateria para fazer o que um rel\u00f3gio tem de fazer: mostrar os dados o tempo todo. Qualquer coisa, \u00e9 s\u00f3 apertar o bot\u00e3o lateral e ele acende uma luz de fundo que ilumina os dados em qualquer situa\u00e7\u00e3o. Falando em bateria, escrevo no 12/11/2020, ou seja, amanh\u00e3 ser\u00e3o duas semanas com ele no pulso praticamente o tempo todo (realmente, s\u00f3 tenho tirado para tomar banho, e ele \u00e9 \u00e0 prova d\u2019\u00e1gua, pois j\u00e1 nadei com ele numa piscina por cerca de meia-hora e n\u00e3o tive problemas): neste momento, a bateria est\u00e1 a 46%. Neste meio tempo, ele ficou ligado o tempo todo, fazendo medi\u00e7\u00f5es autom\u00e1ticas de frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca a cada 30 minutos (isto \u00e9 configur\u00e1vel), monitorando o sono (idem), contando passos o tempo todo e conectado via bluetooth com meu iPhone (sim, funciona com iPhone sem problemas, integrado ao aplicativo Sa\u00fade, a partir do aplicativo Zepp). Ainda sobre a bateria, monitorei sete caminhadas ao ar livre de mais de uma hora de dura\u00e7\u00e3o e uma corrida em esteira de 45 minutos com ele, al\u00e9m de diversas medi\u00e7\u00f5es que fiz de frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca por conta pr\u00f3pria. Minha estimativa \u00e9 que para o meu uso m\u00e9dio, eu precise carreg\u00e1-lo a cada vinte dias (o que \u00e9 muito bom, e conta como um grande ponto positivo do rel\u00f3gio para mim). Em uma das caminhadas, levei um rel\u00f3gio Polar com aquela fita com o sensor para colocar no peito, para comparar com a medi\u00e7\u00e3o de batimentos do Amazfit: a medi\u00e7\u00e3o bateu em 90% do tempo, sem grandes erros, o que - por enquanto - me indica que o frequenc\u00edmetro do Amazfit \u00e9 confi\u00e1vel, embora v\u00e1 fazer outros testes com outros medidores, para ter mais informa\u00e7\u00f5es\u2026 O GPS integrado, ali\u00e1s, \u00e9 bastante preciso, e n\u00e3o \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio levar o telefone para mapear corridas: ao chegar em casa e sincronizar com o telefone, os dados s\u00e3o transferidos imediatamente. Na ergom\u00e9trica, ele marcou uma dist\u00e2ncia percorrida aproximada maior do que a da esteira, mas tenho de testar outras vezes para avaliar melhor. Meu sono tem sido medido com boa precis\u00e3o, com o rel\u00f3gio identificando zonas de sono profundo e momentos em que acordei (por exemplo, para beber \u00e1gua ou algo assim). A integra\u00e7\u00e3o com o aplicativo \u00e9 muito boa, e bastante simples, as atividades f\u00edsicas s\u00e3o bem documentadas e as metas s\u00e3o todas configur\u00e1veis, tornando o aparelho um aliado para projetos de sa\u00fade e bem-estar. Al\u00e9m de tudo, mede dez tipos de atividades f\u00edsicas diferentes, permite que a gente troque a apar\u00eancia da tela com facilidade e bom conjunto de op\u00e7\u00f5es (embora eu ainda n\u00e3o tenha entendido porque - das cinco watchfaces padr\u00e3o - s\u00f3 consigo trocar uma; talvez tenha comido bola em algo), \u00e9 poss\u00edvel ter alertas de chamadas recebidas pelo telefone, assim como notifica\u00e7\u00f5es de quase qualquer aplicativo de mensagens; ele tem um despertador que tenho usado todos os dias (ele vibra no pulso ao inv\u00e9s de fazer um alerta sonoro, o que tenho gostado bastante, dei adeus ao despertador do celular, ao menos por enquanto), permite que eu coloque lembretes, alem de outras funcionalidades. \u00c9 isso: se voc\u00ea chegou at\u00e9 aqui, espero ter dado uma vis\u00e3o geral \u00fatil para ajudar em sua escolha. Em conclus\u00e3o, estou muito satisfeito com o Amazfit Bip S, um smartwatch com pre\u00e7o acess\u00edvel, f\u00e1cil de usar, leve no pulso, de boa constru\u00e7\u00e3o, com boa precis\u00e3o nos sensores e dados, facilidade de uso e no acesso via aplicativo, al\u00e9m de uma bateria que dura - ao menos - duas semanas, num uso intenso.",
            "Gostei do produto. Tomo banho com ele todo dia. GPS muito preciso. Bateria durou 10 dias com monitoramento card\u00edaco 1 min, uso do GPS 7 dias por 1 hora.",
            "Great watch, great tracking and amazing battery life. Can see the screen in the sunlight and it just works as it should do. Awesome.",
            "This is a very good Smart Activity Watch with a few limitations. It should fit most user\u2019s needs. Listed below are a few items which work well and which do not1. Heart Rate Sensor - Better:The heart rate sensor is very good and does a good job doing continuous monitoring.2. GPS Tracking - Best :The GPS tracking is very accurate and connects real fast.3. Battery Life- The Best: Even with continuous heart rate, GPS and notifications turned on, the watch has amazing battery life. It\u2019s only been a week since I started using it and still have 66%4. Sleep Monitoring - Average:The sleep monitoring is not its strong suite. It\u2019s does a good job tracking at night. But any naps or day time sleeps are not recorded. There is no manual option either to record it. Huami released an update for their premium smart watches but nothing yet for Amazfit bip or Bip S5. Workout Modes- Good:I did not try out all the work out modes but cycling/running/ jogging work well and gives you good data6. Watch Faces - Better:It has really good collection of watch faces within the app and also 3rd party watch faces. Considering this is not on Apple or Google eco systems it\u2019s good to know it has such developer base.7. Display- Good:The display is good and works well in all lighting conditions. Works best under direct sunlight.  Of course it\u2019s not super bright like an AMOLED.8. Notifications- Good:The notifications options are good and works for most users. Calls/texts/WhatsApp/Email/ Calendar work well. Personally I did not want all app notifications on my watch. It can get annoying. But if you are looking for more control on app notifications this watch may not be the right choice9. Amazfit App - Good:The app is good and gives a nice summary of all the key dat- HR/ Steps/ Calories/ Sleep. The drill down and details are also there. However, the app can do a better job being more intuitive with detailed information.Overall this watch is very good for someone looking for a above average activity tracker with decent smart watch functions. Hard to find another with equal amount of features and functionality in the same price bracket or even more.",
            "Para quem faz exerc\u00edcios, a bateria n\u00e3o dura os 40 dias anunciados, mas sim uns 15 dias, o que para mim j\u00e1 \u00e9 o suficiente!Muito bom! Vale o investimento!",
            "Great budget running / keep fit watch with a lot of battery life !! Simple",
            "Does the job brilliant battery life easy to use once set up for exercise and fitness tracking it perfect.",
            "Returned this 2 weeks ago and have had no confirmation of receipt of the item.",
            "I apologize for this long review! But if you are very interested in this watch and are about to pull the trigger, please read on so that you make an informed decision.I just needed a cheap fitness tracker / smartwatch to count my steps and help me stay in shape during the pandemic. This seemed to be the one.  I had to weigh the Pros and Cons vs other fitness trackers, and it came down to the Bip S and the Bip U Pro.  Both the Bip S and Bip U Pro have GPS, which was a main requirement for me for biking and walking.  However, the U Pro has a higher resolution LCD screen, but it is not easy to see outdoors and also its higher resolution leads to a lower battery life AND no always-on display (AOD).  The AOD is a convenience because you don't have to keep touching the watch or twisting the wrist to activate the display.  This especially becomes important when you\u2019re biking and want to see your workout stats in real-time.  The Bip S, on the other hand, has unrivalled battery life, an always-on transflective display, and can very easily be seen outdoors, even in sunny weather. These were the deal breakers for me against the Bip U Pro, so I went with the Bip S which was a few dollars cheaper as well.  (EDIT:  I\u2019ve now discovered the Bip U Pro is boxier looking, and, it won\u2019t show the subject in iOS notifications.  So your calendar or reminders will show the time but not the actual description of the event. That\u2019s a showstopper to me.)The Bip S has really motivated me to stay active, and it helps when I can see the number of steps I've walked, right on the watch face.Since my last full charge about 2 day ago, I am at about 84%.  This includes some biking and walking with the GPS, a few elliptical workouts, uploading of watch faces, a few manual heart-rate readings, and notifications from my phone. (EDIT: After 6 days the battery went down to 57%, but I have been using the GPS every day except for one day. On that day the battery only went down by 2-3%!)  That's not bad, and I don't need to worry about charging every other night.  Keep in mind that if you are using the GPS for about 20 minutes (cycling, running) it will use up around 4% of battery.The watch syncs with the Zepp app on iOS/Android, which is done every time you open the Zepp app.  Zepp also integrates with the Apple Health app if you connect Zepp for step tracking and heart rate monitoring.  Additionally, the app can automatically upload your workout data to the Strava social media app for cyclists/runners!For step tracking, I have to sync the watch with the Zepp app, which automatically syncs it with Apple Health.  One important thing to know is that Apple Health is able to distinguish the steps that were taken with the iPhone's built-in step tracker from those that were taken with the watch.  So even if you are walking with both the watch on your wrist and the iPhone in your pocket, the steps will be counted correctly after synchronizing the watch with Zepp, and you won't have double counts.  Just ensure in Apple Health that the Zepp app is added to the Data Sources section and is prioritized to the top of the list.  The Health app will check which steps were taken by the Bip S and then will subtract the conflicting steps that were taken at the same time by the iPhone's own step tracker.  I believe that's how it works, since it's been logging the correct number of steps so far in Apple Health.There are various workout modes on the watch.  You start a workout, such as biking or walking or elliptical, and it starts a timer and shows your heart rate in real time, as well as other metrics such as current speed.  This is really cool especially when you're biking and you can watch your heart rate go up and down.  The GPS feature during walking/biking shows the path on your watch after you are done your workout (it won't show the map, just the path. See the photo I included).  It's cute but it's also a nice feature to have.  When synced with the Zepp app, the app superimposes this path onto a real map of your location.  Hence, I can even leave my phone at home while I bike, while the watch's GPS logs my movement.  Keep in mind that the GPS is not a satellite navigation like Google Maps or Apple Maps; it just logs co-ordinates that are used later with the app, and likely also assists with calculating speed and other metrics during a workout.One really, really good thing about the workout mode is that the always-on display shows the workout activity throughout its execution.  So the screen will not go back to the home screen, and when seen outdoors during the day there\u2019s no need to turn on the backlight either!  This contrasts with other smart watches that require you to press the button or raise your wrist to turn on the display to see the activity while you\u2019re running.  Some watches with AMOLED always-on displays go back to the home screen during a workout too, requiring a button press to switch to the workout screen.Sleep tracking seems to be enabled all the time, because even without the heart rate monitoring enabled I noticed it detected I had slept while wearing it, and gave me some info about my sleep on the Zepp app. I then enabled heart rate detection every minute to get more accurate stats. The sleep tracker will give you info about your Light Sleep and Deep Sleep stages, although it is not without issues.  For example one night I had gotten out of bed twice and it thought I had awoken after the first time, and stopped tracking my sleep instead of continuing after I went back to bed. Otherwise it\u2019s been fine as long as I don\u2019t get out of bed too much and only sleep during the nighttime.  It didn\u2019t detect a lunch-hour nap.Regarding the heart rate sensor, I thought it was not that useful to turn the monitoring on (other than during workouts), until I discovered that the PAI score relies on heart rate data. So that\u2019s why I have turned on the heart rate checking for every minute.  There has been extensive research done for the PAI study and it seems to be a good motivator and indicator for fitness.  Other smartwatch companies are integrating the PAI analysis as well.  I\u2019m glad it\u2019s included in this watch.Another thing that is really handy is a reminder every hour that buzzes me to \"Get up and move\" if I've been a couch potato or working too long on the PC.Overall this has been a very nice experience and now I'm thinking of selling off all my regular watches. However, it doesn't mean it's perfect, there are various things that could be improved on.  Here are some things I observed in the first few days:1) The stopwatch and countdown timers do not show the current time of day.  On the other hand, if you use a Workout mode instead of the stopwatch,  the current time is shown at the top of the display in a small font.2) Notifications show limited information.  In a text message you won't see emojis, they are replaced by strange characters.  Also, for reminders or app notifications, the title is shortened.  The message body also shows limited info, although it is sufficient for short messages.3) The 'Do Not Disturb' setting on the watch does not use the phone's Do Not Disturb times.  So if your phone is set to not notify during sleep hours, your watch will still alert you, unless you turn on Do Not Disturb manually on the watch.  Then you have to turn it back off in the morning.  (My watch face shows a Do Not Disturb mode indicator, so it's easy to know when it's being used.) There is also an \"Auto\" Do Not Disturb setting on the watch but it relies on the sleep tracker feature, which would require you to sleep with it.4) There are various language bugs in the watch.  One is the weather display for Tuesday, which shows up as \"Tus\" instead of \"Tue\".  A funnier bug is in the 1-kilometer alert during a Walking Workout, where it inserts a Spanish word(!) into the alert... \"Velocidad.\"  See the photos I attached.5) The weather feature has a frequent bug where the first page, the one with the current weather, is missing!  A restart of the watch will not fix it.  I had to resync the watch a couple times with the Zepp app to fix it; although I think I also had to manually change the weather location.  (EDIT:  If you manually set the city rather than automatically detect it, it seems to work fine.)6) In the PAI screen there is a glitch where the text is overlapping with the numbers if you achieved your target.  Not sure how they missed that one (see the attached photo).Nonetheless, these are not major issues, but still gives you an indication the developers need better quality control.  Similar small issues are seen on the app but are not showstoppers. I have submitted bug reports for some of them, which I hope will be addressed in a future firmware update.This is really a nice watch, and at a great price.  I do wish it had a higher resolution screen though, but that\u2019s the compromise for better battery life and always-on display.  The fact it has GPS, very good battery life and outdoor viewing is a giant plus for me.  I only really needed a watch with step tracker, but now I\u2019m really getting into the PAI stuff which I discovered from this watch, and hence doing more workouts.  I'm really enjoying it and my health is on its way to improving.==========UPDATE after about 5 weeks:There is a GPS bug that appears to happen every couple of weeks.  When you go on a running or cycling workout and enable the GPS, the path that gets plotted afterward is not correct.  The GPS seems to drift off somewhere else so that it shows the wrong location.  For example, the other day I cycled for about 20 minutes and then I decided to do a 180 degree turn and head back to my origin.  When I viewed the plot, somehow the GPS had drifted off about 1km north from the point I turned around.  The GPS plot of the ride back had the path shifted about 1km north.  To remedy this issue both times I had to turn off the watch and turn it back on.  It would be fine in a subsequent ride.  Perhaps a software glitch on the watch caused this.  But it looks like I will have to do a power cycle of the watch every week or so to prevent this from happening again.",
            "*Commentaires \"En fran\u00e7ais\" \u00e0 la fin!\"The only negative point of this purchase was to pay for a new product and to receive an open box!\"What sets this watch apart from other smartwatches is its battery life.I really enabled all the options and the continuous heart rate monitoring, use of the GPS, \"Always On\" display and notifications and it lasts about 10 days. (Normal Use: environ 15-20 jours)In terms of the accuracy of the heart rate and the steps calculated, it is more precise than the Fitbit Versa 2 and the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2!The Android app for cellular offered with the instructions was not available, but works fine with \"Zepp\" and \"Notify for Amazfit\".Synchronization with \"Google Fit\" is also very good.To receive notifications on the watch, you must use the \"Notify for Amazfit\" application.If you are looking for a watch that has very good accuracy on heart rate, calculated steps, distance with GPS during activities, sleep monitoring WITH good battery life, this is the best choice in my opinion.The positive points are:-Best battery life on the market today-Very precise sensors: Heart rates, GPS, number of steps- 50M water resistant-Lightweight-\"Always On\" display and easy to read outdoors-MultiSport trackingThe negatives points are:-Smaller screen and lower resolution than the new models. (But very easy to read outside)-Does not calculate floors climbed and has fewer built-in apps than more expensive watches.Fran\u00e7ais:\"Le seul point n\u00e9gatif de cet achat \u00e9tait de payer pour un nouveau produit et de recevoir une bo\u00eete ouverte!\"Ce qui distingue cette montre des autres smartwatches, c'est sa dur\u00e9e de vie de la batterie.J'ai vraiment activ\u00e9 toutes les options et la surveillance continue de la fr\u00e9quence cardiaque, l'utilisation du GPS, l'affichage \"Always On\" et les notifications et cela dure environ 10 jours. (Utilisation normale: environ 15-20 jours)En termes de pr\u00e9cision de la fr\u00e9quence cardiaque et des pas calcul\u00e9s, il est plus pr\u00e9cis que la Fitbit Versa 2 et la Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2!L'application Android pour cellulaire offerte avec les instructions n'\u00e9tait pas disponible, mais fonctionne correctement avec \"Zepp\" et \"Notify for Amazfit\".La synchronisation avec \"Google Fit\" est \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s bonne.Pour recevoir des notifications sur la montre, vous devez utiliser l'application \"Notify for Amazfit\".Si vous recherchez une montre qui a une tr\u00e8s bonne pr\u00e9cision sur la fr\u00e9quence cardiaque, les pas calcul\u00e9s, la distance avec GPS pendant les activit\u00e9s, la surveillance du sommeil AVEC une bonne autonomie de la batterie, c'est le meilleur choix \u00e0 mon avis.Les points positifs sont:-La meilleure autonomie sur le march\u00e9 aujourd'hui-Capteurs tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cis: Fr\u00e9quence cardiaque, GPS, nombre de pas- R\u00e9sistant \u00e0 l'eau 50M-Poids l\u00e9ger- Affichage \"Always On\" et facile \u00e0 lire \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur-Suivi MultiSportLes points n\u00e9gatifs sont:-\u00c9cran plus petit et r\u00e9solution inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle des nouveaux mod\u00e8les.

            "What I like is the price, the translucent clock face, the GPS for jogging, the heart rate momitor, the playback control, the multiple clock faces available to customize (although resolution bit is not the greatest). It packs everything a high end watch offers but at a third of the price.I was expecting more battery life which was one of my main reasons in buying this watch, but the 8-9 day total battery life is more realistic. This is having it ON all the time to track my sleeping patterns, GPS for jogs everyday, brightness set to 75%. I also bought a cover for the watch, so overall, I'm satisfied. I use to have to charge every 2 days with my Asus Zenwatch, so it's nice I don't have to charge so periodically.",
            "The advertizement that this watch achieves (or even can achieve) 40 days of use without a recharge is borderline disingenuous. My best span was 10 days with barely 2 notifications per day.If there is a secret or specific series of settings that can achieve this durability mark, it is completely opaque and unknown for us, the users. The previous generation watch got a month without recharge, out of the box.I would say in this regards the product has deteriorated in this version. I will be shopping for a different product when this one wears out.",
            "Poderia ter uma pulseira mais confort\u00e1vel (o mesmo sistema da mi-band).  De resto \u00e9 muito bom comparado ao pre\u00e7o.  GPS n\u00e3o te deixa na m\u00e3o (preciso), sincroniza com o Strava (um pouco demorado, mas faz).  Bateria, bom pelos recursos dura bem 3 a 4 dias com seguran\u00e7a e um pouco mais sem GPS.",
            "I contacted them because the alarm on the watch was not working. They proposed two solutions via email which did not work, so I contacted them again, and they did the same thing. After the third email and over three hours of trying to make the watch work I gave up and threw it in the trash. I have had trouble with apple products, taken them to a store and they fixed them. With amazfit not only would they take no responsibility, they would ask me to fix it, and after spending time doing what they said, which did not work,  their only solution was to propose more futile fixes so I would spend more time trying to fix it.",
            "I wore the original Bip for 2 years and was happy with the Activity and Sleep Tracking, as well as very impressed with battery life, which often lasted close to the month range. I upgraded to this Bip S, and feel like the trade-off of upgraded features, like swim tracking, with significantly worse battery life was worth it for me. Significantly worse battery life means a full charge barely lasting 10 days with daily activity tracking. Not the end of the world as a full top-up is only a couple of hours on the charger and I typically do that immediately after waking up before starting a day off.I'm happy with the Bip S at it's current sub-$100 price point. If it started to get into the $150-$200 range, I'd probably skip it though.TLDR: A good budget activity tracker despite sub-par battery life.",
            "Comprei esse rel\u00f3gio com interesse maior para uso em atividades f\u00edsicas e realmente atendeu muito bem minhas expectativas.

            "La primera carga de la bateria me dur\u00f3 apenas 2 semanas, lo cual es comprensible por la sincronizaci\u00f3n y actualizaciones que se hacen la primera vez.Ahora lleva 11 dias desde que lo volv\u00ed a cargar y aun le queda el 50%.Es perfecto para usarlo en exteriores ya que la luz directa del sol hace que se vea mejor la pantalla.",
            "The phone would not connect with the app which was extremely disappointing because I thought I finally found something budget friendly and as small as an Apple Watch for my petite wrist but DOES NOT CONNECT.  I have to return.  Don\u2019t waste your time.I\u2019m getting an Apple Watch",
            "I am a Pebbles watch owner. Really loved my Pebbles until Fitbit bought them out and thus ended the firmware updates.This Amazfit watch is awesome. I've researched many but none really came close. One problem I initially had with it was that it froze at 7 p.m. every single night and didn't come on again until 6 a.m. even if I hit the button and it would not light up. I realized that I probably accidentally set up an option or two to automatically time out every single night from 7 p.m. till 6 a.m. one thing I do really miss is that although I can see the messages I could not reply. Which defeats the use of the watch if he can't at least reply yes or no. You still have to go to your phone to answer. One of the best features that the Pebbles watch had was that you can set up about 10 different replies. So if you're a nurse, or in a meeting and you need to send a quick reply without pulling out your phone every time you just can't do it.",
            "When I received the product I charged it right away.. the battery went down to 12% between 3 to 4 weeks which was good. I was impressed. However after second charge the battery started discharging rapidly. I have to charge it once a week now. I sent couple of emails about the issue but no response..so bad customer service as well.. Product doesn't deliver what it says. Please don't buy it, I don't recommend.",
            "after using the Amazfit watch for a few months suddenly i can't sync the watch and the workout feature.  the app won't even allow me to send in a user feedback complaint. basically it has turned into a watch.  the warranty expires in 3 months after purchase which is lame.  beware as you buyAs a follow up..a few weeks later uploads work fine perhaps there was a software issue that they were working on and didn\u2019t inform owners of??",
            "Battery life is amazing (I get about 2 weeks out of mine/current settings) and charging is pretty quick as well.  The interface with the app is good and the app just received a major update which I like but haven't spend a lot of time navigating yet but much improved over the last version.I would recommend for the price point.  It does nearly the same amount of 'function' as a name brand without the cash investment - sleep tracking, HR, notifications (calls, texts, FB/messenger, whatsapp, calendar, other social media), alarm, sport/fitness tracking, event reminders.  Covers all the bases for me.",
            "After having another FitBit die on me, I decided to give this a try. I was wary, because FitBit had so many bells and whistles, I was afraid I'd miss some of its features. Fortunately, it hasn't be an issue for me.This watch is incredible. The screen is lower-res than what I'm used to, but it's got a full always-on display, and even with all of its features enabled, I'm on week two off of a single charge and it just hit 50% battery.The only thing I don't like about it is that the alarms are very short - I live in fear of the day that I don't notice the gentle buzzing and wind up late for work. More customizable alarms would make this the best watch I've ever used. I also wish I could make notifications show on the screen for a shorter amount of time.All that aside, I haven't felt so happy with a smartwatch since the Pebble days, and FitBit is now in my rear-view mirror.",
            "I love it. Sometimes there are some bugs but overall the watch and the app work correctly. I gave almost everything on, on my watch and use the GPS tracking twice or more per day and the battery life is about one week. Thank good enough for me.",
            "Comprei o rel\u00f3gio por indica\u00e7\u00e3o de um amigo que tem o Bip, na propaganda de venda falam que a bateria dura cerca de 40 dias. A\u00ed vem a decep\u00e7\u00e3o, a bateria dura no m\u00e1ximo 6 dias. Para exerc\u00edcios \u00e9 at\u00e9 bom, mas no conjunto completo n\u00e3o vale a pena. N\u00e3o recomendo a compra. Baixei o aplicativo \u00e9 tem v\u00e1rias fun\u00e7\u00f5es do aplicativo que n\u00e3o tem suporte no Brasil. Enfim, me arrependi de ter comprado.",
            "Not as bright as other smartwatches I've owned, but the key is battery life and an always-on screen (other brands basically don't tell you the time!). I do like the watch faces & also the general UI / tracking. Bit weird that the app is called \"Zepp\", which really sounds like it's a rip-off. Should be in the instructions so I know that the app is legitimate.",

            "I have been an honest customer of UMIDIGI. Bought this watch and absolutely love this UMIDIGI Urun. The packaging was impressive. First of all, it's easy to set up and great battery life. Comfortable to wear. The touch screen is very responsive and fingerprint resistant with 4 changeable dial setting. Call & Text notification, Facebook notification work well, however, Facebook messenger notification only worked for a couple of days in my phone. The watch has different17 sport mode to track fitness activity and provide heart rate reading, Oxygen level, Sleep tracking, weather and you even use to control music in your phone. Other useful features are flashlight, alarm, compass, timer, stopwatch and find.The magnetic charger is not strong enough and gets disconnected easily.Overall, GOOD VALUE PRODUCT",
            "The build quality of this watch is quite nice (metal frame with glass screen). The screen is quite responsive and viewability under direct sun light is adequate.The watch came pre-charged  at about 60%. Charging was completed to 100% in 40mins. I have set the watch to continuously to monitor heart rate and the battery sits at about 90% after a day from full charge. The step counter seems to match that of my other devices and connectivity to my android device was fairly simple to configure.Overall I am satisfied with my purchase. Its a great entry level watch with heart rate, gps, sports modes and connectivity to android. I would recommend this product!",
            "First off, the unboxing experience is just like unboxing a high end smartphone, with precise & solid packaging.The aluminium frame is really nice, while the glass watch face has an amazing oleophobic coating, which means that water runs right off it, or beads up and all is needed is to tilt the watch and it instantly becomes dry. The buttons are tactile but not clicky, which is great. The band has the appearance of smooth leather, with UMIDIGI text on the buckle, with plenty of holes for adjustment.The display itself has a decent resolution, while the viewing angles are amazing (particularly for an LCD display), which has 3 backlight brightness levels, and it's bright enough to see it clearly when outdoors. The screen responds well, with smooth animations. However, the animations only activate after your finger has left the screen, but I guess there are reasons for that (to use less battery, or avoid accidental swipes, for example).The step counting is very overstated, and the sleep tracking isn't perfect, but seems to be getting better. It does show deep sleep though, which my fitness tracker (costing 2\u00d7 more) does not.The activity tracking works quite well, tracking location & distance with reasonable accuracy (but messing up when you're not travelling). Some activities didn't show the full route on the app, but the distance was much higher than the route was showing.The heart rate and SPO2 monitoring works really well.A full charge of the battery only lasted me just over 5 days, which is less than expected but better than a high end smartwatch. I only had 24/7 HR monitoring enabled on the first day, and occasionally connected it to the app, with some activity tracking on 2 days.The instructions are minimal, but after getting used to the watch and its functions, it's straight forward.The Paiactive app works decently well, but can take forever to load the device settings. It also uses significant amounts of battery, even with app closed and Bluetooth turned off, and having the battery optimisation turned on in Android settings. Despite this, it says that the app has been in active use, and continues to increase \"active use\". I've had to disable the app in background to prevent it from draining my phone's battery.I updated both types of the software (system version & resource version) when I started using the watch on December 31, so I'm hoping that these issues can be fixed in future updates, as the watch is very good hardware wise.",
            "I bought this watch with some reservation. I was intending to pair it with my iPhone. Knowing apples reputation for to being very compatible I was a bit concerned. Turned out my reservations were correct. Notifications get pushed through to the watch so often that it is downright annoying. The notifications don\u2019t even align with those coming up on the phone.My partner has a Umidigi phone so we tested with that and it functions properly without the over the top notifications so it\u2019s definitely an apple pairing issue rather than the watch.The other big issue for me is that the watch is too large for a female. It is wearable however the watch face is large and just doesn\u2019t look or feel right.",
            "I'm an Android user and unfortunately, right now, it seems there is only the official app that supports this device.This app is really unstable & incomplete. It seems more like an Alpha version. Fingers Cross for a future update.It's a shame because the device seems nice and good quality.I hope someone else will make a different app and enable more options.But hey, in the end, it's 60$ product, but I'll be back to Mi Band.",
            "Wrong time on watch. Auto time & date on mobile.  Changed to manual date & time. Reset phone & watch. Still 30 minutes out on the time. Did Google search for solutions. Nothing!It's a darn shame because the rest of the features work fine.BUT a watch is no good if it shows wrong time.",
            "I found the watch easy to set up and connect with my phone. I have tested most of the health functions and they seem responsive to changes, I cannot accertain the accuracy of the values but they seem to make sense. The music skip function works and so does the remote camera shutter, \"find my phone\" and the various notifications I have tested so far. I am yet to try out the GPS on a run but I am happy with my purchase so far! The bezels are quite big and there are not that many watch faces to choose from but the watch met my expectations!",
            "The quality is good. The app and features needs a lot of improvement. It does not even show battery life remaining. i.e. battery status.The steps counter and the sleep hours are very in accurate. Around 30% in accurate. These are features I bought the watch for.I would like a refund on the watch. Please arrange for this to happen.",
            "I love the look of this watch. Had a few issues with the time at the start, but I contacted the seller via Amazon and they fixed it with an update. Bluetooth drops out easily, needs to have longer range.",
            "A very poor product overall.  It was very difficult to connect to the app, and then the app itself was very poor (poor connectivity to the device).  The watch cannot be used properly without the app.  Until the app is improved considerably, I would not consider buying this product.  When we finally logged on to the app, it suggested the app software be updated with the latest release.  We followed the instructions and it \"bricked\" the watch.",
            "Battery life says up to 10 days but my battery only lasts 2.5/3 daysInstructions are not clear on how to link things such as music or the camera which seems to be features and option available on the watch.But everything else it does it perfect.It is water proof, the message option and call visibility is great. Love the exercise, steps oxygen,blood pressure counts and features",
            "Have been this smart watch for over a week now. It it a very good workout tracker. I have included workouts from the the free software used on android phone. You can run with just the watch as GPS is built into the watch. Battery lasted well over a week as well.",
            "Watch is performing as described. The one issue  that the one I purchased has, is that the step counter is not any where accurate. It measures  steps too quickly. This seems to be a problem with most smart watches but this one can jump 30-40 steps with a movement of the wrist. I reduce my step count for the day by  200-300 steps to allow for inaccuracy.",
            "The app this watch uses will not let me register so I cannot connect my iPhone to the watch. Waste of money.",
            "I have spent a little bit of time only looking at the functions. So far it is exactly what I require. I have even managed to set alarms for reminder on it.",
            "Great customer supportI had an issue with the screen \"couple of dead pixels\".I sent them a photo with showing that and they immediately sent me a new one.The watch is very good value for money.The only issue I see is the blood pressure measurement. It is not accurate.",
            "Not bad for a budget smart watch . It was easy to pair with my iPhone. Otherwise some poor written instructions where the writing is so small it\u2019s impossible to read ! I wish I could work out more about it but unless I invest in a microscope it will remain a mystery.",
            "Stopped working after 2 monthsCan't return b/C it is out of 30 days window",
            "I loved it until a week ago when it stopped. Battery won't charge. So an expensive time machine that only lasted a few weeks.",
            "Not sure if it's worth the money. Never been able to sync up. Neither it connects to get the calls or sms. No way to change the time unless you always stay connected to paiactive app.",
            "The diameter of the watch doesn't reflect the screen information.There is a 3-4 mm outer rim that is not used",
            "Didn't add steps correctly didn't connect properly to my phone, have since purchased another watch through Amazon which I feel is better.",

            "good product for the money",
            "Prompt delivery and exactly as advertised, good reviews as far as l can see",
            "I have tested this product across 5 days and two devices: Samsung Galaxy A71 & Samsung Galaxy S10+. The watch does an amazing job at tracking fitness activity like heart rate, steps, oxygen levels, calories and other fitness metrics and has great data tracking. The app is great and easy to use. The touch screen is responsive, clear, bright and fairly scratch and fingerprint resistant. Another great feature is the ability to control music very easily. Other useful features include changeable watch faces, text and call notifications, alarm, weather, and camera shutter. The build quality is good, presentation/packaging is good. The battery life is surprisingly exceptional and the Bluetooth connection is very good with zero dropouts. Now there are a few cons, the camera shutter is only a shutter it does not display the image from the phone onto the watch, the watch band material is okay, but I would get replacement watch bands, there is no NFC thus I cannot use google pay from the watch, bigger bezels and less screen in comparison to rivals, and lastly the magnet of magnetic charger is not very strong and may become disconnected with small movements of the watch or charging wire.",
            "Bought this to replace a Honor Band. Overall, it is a good value. It would be a great device if the software becomes more refined.Good:-well build-attractive styling-battery life is about a week-SpO2 is great at this price point. I tested and it seems to response to my attempts to hold breath-Heart meter is accurate against my Omron-Notification from Whatapps and Facebook works. Can see the whole message if needed. Very convenience not to have to reach the phone to read message.-Locate the phone is a cool feature as well. It rings the phone when you misplace the phone. I used it twice already lol.Can improve:-software is not as seamless-ios app is buggy - android app is more stable-I wish they add a feature to periodically measure the sp02. would help people with sleep apnea.",
            "Manual was too fine/light to read, even the QR codes were not scannable due to size on a umidigi One Pro 64 (Phone).  Code on back of manual does take you to the Umidigi website successfully.bios version 0.22 seems rather early for a retail release.App (Paiactive) took many tries to recognize watch, and without linking you can't even set the time...First Urun watch I received had problems with setting up/maintaining the Bluetooth connection.Sensors do seem to work. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels, step counter, sleep monitor.Battery life is very good, the last 24 hours used 6% battery.Media remote control works with VLC.Camera remote is in the app, but I'm not sure how to make the watch take the picture.Overall lots of features for the money provided they continue to update the watch and app.Update:  Battery life with latest firmware is terrible, barely lasting 18 hours (drops to 20% from full)Bluetooth problems may have been due to the Umidigi phone (a premium flagship model) but they were unwilling to troubleshoot.",
            "Al principio te pide actualizar para poder tener \"una mejor experiencia\" peor solo te ocasiona un susto al aparecer en la pantalla \"APP\" sin poder hacer nada, pero solo debes de salir de la app del tel\u00e9fono y volver a actualizar, en general es buen producto y lo recomiendo bastante, pues la calidad por el precio es buena, gana muchos puntos al tener GPS y protecci\u00f3n contra agua 5ATM, el ox\u00edmetro no es muy bueno pero por el precio esta bien.",
            "I absolutely LOVE this UMIDIGI Urun watch! Easy set up, excellent battery life as advertised. This watch has become my best workout buddy!  The workmanship is very good. It has a built in compass to show me the directions if I am ever lost. The most important feature for me is the onboard GPS capability, I can leave my phone at home while I go out for jogging , and I can confirm it is accurate.  It's very comfortable,The low weight design is ideal for work outs. I some times forget that its around my hand. Pretty cool fitness tracker at a very affordable price. Overall I am really happy with this smart watch.",
            "I have a UMIDIGI Android smartphone also purchased from Amazon. This smartwatch has some neat features such as blood pressure, oxygen level, and heart rate monitor which seem to work well. At first I was able to pair the watch and phone and use the Paiactive app to connect with Strava to view GPS data of a recent walk. It all looked accurate, and Strava was able to export a GPX file which could then be used in Garmin Basecamp and Google Earth.Unfortunately, when it came time to reconnect the watch and phone I wasn't successful although the phone said they were connected, but the watch and the Paiactive app said they were not connected. I don't know what sequence (watch first or second, phone Bluetooth on/off) would have proven successful. It could have been much more user friendly, especially between two products of the same company, UMIDIGI.I usually run in the early morning six or so days a week when it is dark, and I depend on a smartwatch to monitor/view my heart rate. I also wear glasses to see properly. Unfortunately I found the numbers on the watch face too small to read my heart rate and there doesn't seem a way to illuminate the dial. Walking in the daylight wearing glasses should work for most users like me as would wearing it around the house or casually.This UMIDIGI  smartwatch certainly looks good, seems well made, and the price is excellent; however, for my needs it falls short and the challenge in pairing isn't helpful.",
            "UnpackingThe box containing the UMIDIGI SMARTWATCH Urun black.I find the specific codes for the Umidigi brand with the choice of the packaging box and the presence of the brand.Umidigi may be a small manufacturer, but they are quite consistent in their packaging.The box contains the watch, a big manual and a cable to recharge the watch.First configurationThe Umidigi Urun does not require any special configuration. In a few clicks, the watch is fully operational, all you have to do is connect it to a smartphone and download Paiactive apk to use its features .I didn't have to do a firmware update like with the Huawei Active GT which had to reboot 9 times before getting the right firmware.FinishThe Umidigi Urun is not a premium smartwatch, Umidigi has clearly targeted small budgets by offering a smartwatch at this price.Small price often rhymes with poor finish, but this is far from being the case with Urun model . The smartwatch is made of plastic but at no time did I have the impression to have a poor quality product around my wrist.The Urun can be controlled from the touch screen in combination with the two large buttons on the right. You don't have to read the manual to master the Urun, the menus are quite logical.You can charge the watch with magnetized cable and is naturally placed on the connector of the watch.ConnectivityThe Urun connects through Bluetooth with the smartphone. It is accessible on any bluetooth phone, so you don't need to buy an Umidigi phone to use it.Battery rangeThe Urun has an autonomy of 2 weeks if you don't do any sport. If, on the other hand, you practice sport on a daily basis using the watch's tracking, I get an autonomy between 7 and 9 days.Screen qualityThe display of the Urun is surprisingly good for this price range. It offers good contrast, everything is perfectly readable even the smallest characters.The display has a good brightness that will allow you to use the watch in almost all conditions and doesn`t have automatic brightness.The display can be customized directly from the watch, you can choose from 4 different types of display.You will find the following features:- time- monitoring of number of steps, calories,sleep monitoring, SpO2,BP, weather and heart rate- 17 sport modes (Run,Walk,Cycle,Treadmill,Bike,etc)- reading incoming messages (SMS only)- alarmclock configurated from the Paiactive apk- flashlight.compass, find your phone and shutter for your phone camera- timer, stopwatch- control playing your music stored on your phoneHeart rate monitoringThe Urun allows you to monitor your heart rate but and offer continuous monitoring. You can see your heart rate in real time when you access the feature on the watch, you will also see the highest and lowest heart rate of the day. However,you will see graphs showing the evolution of your heart rate throughout the day on the Paiactive apk.The heart rate values are quite close to what I get with a Mi Band 4, these values are quite close to reality with a maximum deviation of 5 to 10%.Sleep dataThe Urun allows you to monitor your sleep by dividing the data into 3 categories: deep sleep, light sleep and wake-up times.I don't know if these data are credible because each watch seems to make different calculations. So far, all the watches I've tested indicate that I have a deep sleep deficit, with the Urun it's the opposite. Who is right? I don't know.CompatibilityThe Urun can in principle be used with any bluetooth compatible smartphone that can use the Paiactive application.I tested it with several phones (Xiaomi,Motorola,Nubia,Umidigi) and it worked every time.",
            "El reloj  es bastante funcional. Siento que las estimaciones de frecuencia, ox\u00edgeno, sue\u00f1o y actividad son bastante cercanas a la realidad, y hasta te alerta cuando tu frecuencia cardiaca es muy alta. La conectividad y sincronizaci\u00f3n con iOS y sus aplicaciones es de verdad bastante buena, ya que puedes ver las notificaciones directamente en la pantalla (s\u00f3lo texto, no stickers, fotos, gif's, etc). El dise\u00f1o es discreto y elegante.Solo le veo algunos detalles:1. Principalmente la duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda. Supongo que por la sincronizaci\u00f3n con varias aplicaciones y sus respectivas notificaciones, a penas llega a 3 d\u00edas.2. La pantalla es m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a de lo que aparenta. Tiene un marco bastante ancho, por lo que es m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a de lo que se aprecia en el video de la publicaci\u00f3n.3. A veces no reconoce el movimiento del antebrazo o tarda en encender para poder ver la hora.En general considero que tiene una muy buena relaci\u00f3n calidad precio.",

            "Me and my wife have the same watch, the issue is seen on both of themWe have umidigi bison and A9 ProI had before the umidigi ufit with Veryfitpro no similar issue was seenHere are my issues: this is seen on both umidigi urun1. If the phone and watch are disconnected for too long, it never reconnect bluetooth. I need to powercycle the watch and phone to reconnect bluetooth. Other device are able to connect to the phone bluetooth, not sure the watch is not able to re-connect.2. The application Paiactive, when you click My->support bring you umidigi support, but when you filed issue, they said that the application support is not handle here, but where to get application support>??3. The heartbeat tracking when doing exercise fluctuate alot, see attach screenshot4. The upload activity from Paiactive to strava is very minimum, only the time and exercise type is uploaded, no heart beat data is uploaded. This was working with umidigi ufit and Veryfitpro, the heartbeat data was uploaded to strava.Now I am not sure about the sleep or heartbeat tracking",
            "Excelente calidad y precio, ok me decid\u00ed a comprar este tel\u00e9fono por que tengo el celular BISON de la misma marca que me sorprendi\u00f3, el reloj me lleg\u00f3 en tiempo y forma la caja perfectamente sellada el reloj totalmente nuevo sin ning\u00fan problema.El software tiene todo lo que necesito y es todo lo que anuncia, todas las aplicaciones funcionan muy bien, puedes vincular tu cuenta a STRAVA y GOOGLE FIT,  el GPS funcionando hasta mejor que otros smartwach de precio m\u00e1s elevado, fue muy f\u00e1cil vincularlo a mi tel\u00e9fono en fin muy satisfecho con mi compra, sin duda seguir\u00e9 los  productos de UMIDIGI",
            "Well if it did in fact take my heart rate it would probably show it as abnormal.This watch was a straight out of the box problem. I usualy wait sometime to write am accurate review but in this case why wait, the problem is obvious and seems persistant.Im giving it 3 stars for the following reasons :1. I may have got a defective watch so i can't honestly test it and it's functionalities2. The battery life seemes incredible, 3 days on and still above 90% according to the app3. Very quick response from seller, less than 24h on the first email (no trespasser yet on the second)4. it has a really nice feel on the wrist5.it does look really good visuallyIt worked fine until it asked to update the firmware. Once that was done successfully the watch was responsive to the wrist tilt but is stuck on the firmware update screen. Turning the watch on and off didn't work no mather what i do its stuck on that same screen.",
            "Used the watch for 2 days, charged it to 100% life and now its at 20%. Not sure how this can last 10 days.Also the watch keeps disconnecting even when my phone is in my pocket.Blood pressure hasn't worked either.I would rethink the purchase.Edit*Contacted product support and it was totally useless, they told me to upgrade everything and make sure i wear the watch tight. Send them pictures of the watch searching for messages. After all that the watch notfications and trackers are still hit and miss, mostly miss.",
            "I use fitness tracker watches a lot. Own a few pairs from other major manufacturers. First and foremost the umidigi Urun is built with quality in mind, even though it's a budget priced watch. The features, and battery life are incredible. It's waterproof so no need to remove while showing or swimming. Another great feature is the built in GPS that most others would charge Atleast 3 times more with. The heartrate and sleep tracker seems to work accuratelyThe watch screen is vivid, large, and responsive. Also the battery life is well into premium brand territory. Overall I would give this watch 10/10 for value and features.",
            "I bought this hoping to have a basic smartwatch to wear that I wouldn't be afraid of destroying, something to replace my 4 year old Fitbit... Unfortunately this is not that...  Well it is a basic smart watch there are way too many flaws with this to be considered viableFirst and the biggest negative is the fact that the app (Paiactive) is not available in the Google Play store and needs to be side loaded... that is a huge red flag for security reasons at a minimum.  Once the app is loaded it is extremely slow, unresponsive and buggy, and continually asks to allow background battery usage.As for the watch it is decent but has some issues as well: The touch screen is way too sensitive to the point where wearing it under a sweater will continually cause the screen to be turned on and even activate \"buttons\"  I had it activate find my phone mode a couple times, screen background changes etc.This smartwatch does not use Bluetooth LE and requires an \"active\" Bluetooth connection at all timesThe smart notifications are unusable, while only having \"phone and messages\" notifications turned on within the app I was getting near constant notifications for everything and anything... Including notifications that my phone was charging every time the percentage changed.The sleep tracking was totally wrong as well, I am a shift worker and we'll working a 12 hour night shift it counted me as asleep from 11pm to 4am on multiple nights yet didn't track my sleep while I was actually asleep.About the only good thing about this watch is the battery life, in the 2 weeks I have had this watch I have only had to charge it twice.I have never sent anything back before and unfortunately this will be the first thing.  I can't get past the negatives to keep it. I will be ordering a higher end watch.",
            "Just got the watch yesterday! Already have a umidigi S5 Pro phone which i really like, so i thought i would try their watches.  I like the size, configuration pretty simple.  The app downloaded no problem and i was able to easily configure the watch.  Ive had a few positive comments from people seeing the watch on my wrist.  Im happy so far! would prefer a few more choices of time screens and still learning to use all the features.  Found that the remote camera operation only seems to work with the downloaded app and not your other camera apps on the phone but maybe im missing something.  All in all i would recommend for the price.Revised ReviewI like the watch but there is absolutely no support. Amazon says contact umidigi for warranty issues (battery life down to couple hours after 6 months). Umidigi support replied back to me we on support phones you need to contact your vender for warranty. Do not buy if you expect any support or warranty.",
            "I got this watch for my partner and myself and although only $40, I really had higher expectations that the bluetooth would stay connected to my phone while I was in another room. The point of having the watch was so I wouldn't have to look at my phone for messages during meetings/presentations, but not only am I still looking at my phone for messages, I am looking at my phone for the TIME. Because when this watch disconnects from the phone and I turn it off (especially at bedtime)...the time completely stops and I need to go into the phone app to reconnect it because the time is the same as when I turned it off... Fitbit can actually be used as a watch without a phone. This watch is a horrible accessory to the phone. I needs the phone or it doesn't have anything smart about it. Really disappointed.Going to be returning this watch and my partner's. They aren't happy with theirs either.",
            "I ordered this watch as my second Umidigi watch and i like it very much. The box contains the watchm the charging cable and the user manual. As recommended in the manual, it needs to be fully changed before pairing with the phone. The pairing is using an app and is not difficult.I used this Urun smartwatch for 4 days and the battery level is at 81%, will likely last another 15 days before needed to be recharged. The design is very simplistic but functional, with a lot of features. It includes an oxygen sensor, and few reminders for drinking water, exercise, and others. The strap is a made of good quality rubber and makes it easy to put the watch on.Overall, the watch looks more like a premium watch and with similar features as the Fitbit but at a more competitive price.",
            "Good hardware with a lot of potential. Large display is easy to read in full sun. Battery life is decent. Unfortunately the iOS app Paiactive is very flawed. There are obvious bugs like the step count always showing ____ on the summary page. The app randomly logs out and then you have to log in with your password , which  is not retained in the keychain. The timing and duration of sleep phases are totally different from a Fitbit charge 4, which accurately logs awake periods. I can be sitting for an hour reading with a pulse of 50 bpm but get a resting heart rate estimate of 70-80 bpm. Eyeballing it that would seem to be my average daily rate when I\u2019m not doing an activity. I continue to use it because the clock face is legible in full sun as are messages and other notifications, things that the Fitbit is awful for.  So for $45 is useful but not as an activity tracker.",
            "It has been a bit more than a month now I have been using this and held off on giving my feedback as I was expecting it to fail. It's still working! I am plesantly surprised.My thoughts on the fitness or other health tracking part is that you need to take it with a grain of salt as it counts my steps even if I move my arm while sitting at times. So I deduct 1/4 of steps from what it tells me. What I like about this watch is,  it has great display, gets me phone notifications, vibrates if you want or not,display activates when I want to see what time it is, looks stylish and certainly not cheap looking. Battery is okay, it lasts about 3.5 days or so and I just turned off the vibration to see if it would give me a better battery life. Screen is very bright and sometimes if I am wearing it for the night when you get up in the middle of the night you can see where you are walking in the dark with its bright display :) it does have a flash light function too by the way. I didn't use all of its functions that is available so I can't comment on them. You have to download an app on your phone to be able use this watch fully but once you set it up you can use it independantly, though it won't function fully. The app is buggy and has connection issues. Most of the time I don't bother updating it and the tracker info is available on the watch itself when needed. The app doesn't keep the history properly, so there is no use trying to get it to work. I hope they will come up with a better app soon.So in short, if you don't want to take a mortgage to buy an iphone or other big brand names, this is perfect.",
            "When I opened the box, I was surprised and happy to see UMIDIGI has stepped up the well finished tasteful matching of watch bands and the tasteful matching of the aluminum watch frame.They make it easy to choose what sport you'll do. The nudge and buzz it gives to remind you to do some exercise is super. When I compared blood pressure, heart rate, to my blood pressure sleeve, Pretty much right on.I think the GPS makes it a great gift for kids and even the elderly with some form of memory impairment. The Pai active app is pretty good. Just remember to use the bar code to access it upon set up. My wife already told me she'd like one also.",
            "This is a nice looking watch. I had for a long time different mibands (since the one with no screen up to mi Band 5) they served me really well. Because of that, I might just be spoiled by the battery lasting on this one.I'm using it for 5 days and the battery is already at 50% - and in not an intensive user and I don't have constant heart/pressure tracking activated. My last mi Band would last for 40-45 days.The app for this one is quite confusing. It doesn't have the same name on the branding or anywhere when you open it. It also trains a CRAZY amount of battery... So I have to stop the app if I don't want my phone to die half way the day.To connect the watch itself to the phone was a hard process... It took me about 20 minutes to figure out how to troubleshoot it...",

The latest Urun is more modern looking than the previous models, and now with GPS l can wear this to track my runs - something I miss from my Garmin. The battery life is good and the watch is stylish, and it has every feature I need from my expensive Galaxy Watch and Apple Watch - and at a fraction of the price, I don't need to \"baby\" it as much, so I can wear this daily. It is very comfortable to wear and have no issues connecting to my phone. Would highly recommend.",

            "I purchased this watch last week. I was excited and have used this brand before with no issues. I did read the reviews about low battery life but thought maybe those people received faulty equipment or something.I received the watch, charged it as instructed, set it up as instructed and this thing won't pair to my phone properly. I can't get messages, can't control my music options, don't receive any notification what so ever.Not the end of the world, however, this watches batter last two days IF I'm lucky and I have the watch on the lowest lighting option and quickest \"sleep\" time so the screen is literally almost always off.I'm thoroughly disappointed with this watch and it's quality.Look elsewhere for other options. This isn't what you'd think it would be.Update Aug 9th - less than a month later and this battery won't even last a day!!! This is absolute garbage. Do not buy!",
            "This watch is nice looking and has a great battery life. Regrettably, that is where it ends. This watch and the app that supports it (Palactive) do not work well together. Seeing that the app provides the watch with all its synced info, if it won\u2019t sync the watch is useless. I\u2019ve had this watch for a couple of weeks and it takes so long to sync, if is does at all, that I\u2019ve given up trying. The trouble shoot I\u2019m told is that the watch is too far away from my phone, but actually I place the watch on top of the phone and still won\u2019t sync (and yes my Bluetooth is on and so is the watch). The instructions manual provided is small and not very detailed. Also making this watch hard to use. I have made due by looking for answers online. It\u2019s really too bad because the watch itself is nice and well made, this company should have also focused on the supporting it. I will be sending this watch back.",

            "Great product!  Worth 5 stars for a $50 sw.All functions works well, Bluetooth connection to phone is stable and reliable. Pretty comprehensive features (24HR heart rate, BP, O2 level and built in GPS).... just no ECG measurement.Few minor things are the sleep tracking is  not as good as my fitbit as I felt.  Brightness level is not automatic but it can be change in three levels.  Also when you accidentally touch and hold the screen it will pop up for changing graphics layout.... kind of annoying for this one.The watch does push txt messages from phone but support is minimal such as it won't display any photos and/or emoji.Paiactive app has enough features and deem to be quite reliable.  User can also sync some the data to Google fit.",
            "1st order: Heart rate wasn't accurate. It showed 20-30 BPM higher than my other smartwatches. So I returned it.2nd order: Battery didn't even for 36 hours upon fully charging. It's monitoring my sleep even when I'm awake or not wearing it. So I'm returning this one too.Better not to buy. Save money, time and the hassle of returning it.",
            "The Umidigi Urun is a good smart watch for the price.  It does everything I need it to and I don't have to pay a fortune for a plethora of additional features that I don't need.  I used to use higher end smart watches which have a lot of customizability and ability to add additional apps but I am no longer interested in those features.  I find I played with those features in the beginning for a little bit, but in the long run only find value in the main functions.There are not a lot of watch faces to choose from on the Urun, but the ones that are there are fine for me.  There is no automatic activity detection, but I am fine with manually starting activity tracking when I'm going to go for a run or walk.  You do get a lot of detail on your phone about your activities which I like.I had a hard time figuring out how to get notifications on my watch like text messages and notifications of phone calls, but I eventually figured that out.  I don't get my e-mail messages, but that may just be a setting I am missing.  I didn't look for it too hard as I don't want my e-mails on my watch anyways.  I'm mostly interested in text messages.The watch os is easy to use and quick to get accustomed to.  I verified that the heart rate monitor is as accurate as my Polar chest strap, so that is great.  The battery life is excellent!There is a fairly large bezel around the screen.  At first I didn't know what to think about it, but honestly I got used to it and it is perfectly fine for me.  Has a nice basic elegant look and is much lighter than my previous watches.  Comfortable to wear all day and night.The URun is not the most feature packed smart watch, but I am very happy with it as it has everything I need at a very reasonable price.  I'm tired of overpaying for technology!",
            "Fast shipping.Contents in box:1 x Umidigi Urun smart watch1 x USB magnetic charging cable1 x User manualThe app connecting the watch to phone is called Paiactive, and it is available in both Google Play and Apple App Store.Two physical buttons on right side of watch. Top one, long press to turn on or off the watch; short press to return to main screen. Bottom one is a multi-function button.Main screen shows time, day of the week, date, heartbeat rate, and step walked.More functions, 24 hour heartbeat rate monitor, blood oxygen level, weather forecast, music control on the phone, activity summary (steps walked and calorie burnt).In setting interface, you can also turn on Do not disturb mode, keep screen on for 5 min, find cellphone, alarm and setting of the watch.I have also tried it in showering, and it is waterproof.After tried out this Umidigi Urun smart watch on for a few days now, and I have to say it is a great quality built smart watch and packed with features. I love it.",
            "Just received my Umidigi smart watch today.  I have purchased many products from Umidigi in the past and they are my favorite Chinese brand for reliability and innovative features.  One of the key features that attracted me to this new model smart watch is the long 10 day battery life and the fact that it's waterproof.  Both of these are super important and the reason that the Urun is better then others.There are a ton of features that I didn't even realize it offered (sleep monitor, GPS, route tracking, pedometer, best rate monitor, oxygen monitor, etc.).And the fact that I don't need to charge it daily or even weekly is amazing!  Excited to put it to the test at the gym and out in the snow today.",
            "Wow, Great job UMIDIGI !!!Best:- Notification well displayed on the screen and easily readable compare to other smartwatches that I used in the past. I am able to see the whole message, that's a plus plus for me !!!- The heart meter is very accurate, that's a plus for me !!!- The battery life is more than a weekGood:- SpO2 is great- I have been able to scan the QR Code (iOS) to easily install the app.- Nice build, very attractive- Vibration level is perfect, you won't miss anything for sureBad:-Nothing so far, that very good !!!I didn't have the chance to test all the features but this is the best firmware/UI that I have seen so far.I really love that watch, I recommend it to anyone that doesn't want to pay $600. This watch has almost all the features that the high-end models have.",
            "I am very very sad about it but it's a huge disappointment.  My journey with this watch didn't start well from the very beginning because it was delivered to a wrong address so I had to go at night by walk in the snow to get it myself. Good thing that it was only 200meters away but in front of other ppls door. Anyways... I had very high expectations as a 'first time smart watch user' but this did not get me. It was easy to set up and to connect it to the app but from the very first day I noticed it kept losing the connection with my phone, so some features (like the find my phone) was already totally useless because I always had to have my phone in my hand and reconnect the watch. I went to run with it 3 times, which was good, it was accurate with the distance and speed . After 4 days of use I wanted to reconnect it to my phone just with opening the app and it has never connected anymore... so the watch was not a watch anymore since it shows the accurate time only if it connects by bluetooth, you can't set up anything by yourself... I tried everything, resetting and restarting. I uninstalled the app and downloaded again... nothing helped. The watch lost its connection with my phone and I wasn't able to connect them again. I tried to get in touch with the company, their answer was: they don't deal with problems of their watches, they dont fix them, everything I need to know is written in the manual... I called Amazon, they didnt have any solution either so I'm returning the watch I really wanted to be the best for me. I give 2 stars because of the look (it is a pretty watch) and because of the good experience with the sport mode. But for me it became totally unusable.  I'm still thinking about giving it another go (and ordering another one) if other people had good experiences, maybe I was simply unlucky and got a model with errors. Not sure... but the company's 'reaction' doesnt feel so much encouraging...",
            "The watch is very well built.Pros:The color and style are what I like, it meets my expectations.There are multiple sports modes, and features.The reminders as drink water, take medication etc are very useful.Cons:The step counters are not accurate, it is actually very off. I woke up in the morning and only took few steps from bedroom to kitchen and it already counted few hundreds steps and I'm not living in a huge place.The calories count on sports mode seems wrong too. I had few 30 mins yoga sessions these days, it only calculated 2 kcal per session.I am not complaining the APP as other comments perhaps it is now updated version. I had no problems using it.It is only the step counts disappointed me. hopefully the accuracy can be improved in firmware update or so.",
            "Pro's: This product works great. Has a decent battery life and I like the sleep tracking. It has GPS tracking tons of sports options. Info like that the band can accomodate a wide range of sizes. Works great with my google pixel.Cons:. I find it hard to swipe the screen to get where I want to go. It doesn't have a lot of clock face options. The thing I disliked the most was I got the rose gold pink band.  After a week it started looking black and worn.  I wish I got the black band BC the pink one now looks cheap and now I have to look for a black band. Picture enclosed.",
            "When it works it's great when it doesn't it's an annoying waste of time, sleep disturbance and a steaming pile of hot garbage.- It has no internal time function so completely forgets time when turned off or runs out of power.- It will also forget how to sync to device if turned off or runs out of power.- There is no way to change alarms or reminders outside of the app so if the battery dies you're screwed.-It refuses to turn off while charging.Basically prepare to be awoken at 3 am by your 5 pm alarm and have to fight with the app/watch to get it to sync.",
            "OK, I have tried many of these, for myself and my family, we are active, and I want a watch that really works.  So many have different features.  This watch looks great, my wife approves, and it works.  The GPS built in is great.  My wife has one, and my son as well, finally, a good watch that really does it all.Now, if they could add more sports, does not seem that hard to me, but what do I know.Get this watch, you will be happy!",
            "I have an UMIDIGI Power cell phone for a year now; in my review, the product is extraordinary. A week ago, my wife\u2019s phone died, so bought another UMIDIGI cell phone (UMIDIGI A7 Pro). Again, I am very awed with the brand. Together with the phone, I bought the UMIDIGI Urun watch. As the other UMIDIGI products I bought, this watch is remarkable. The finishing and aesthetics are superb. The watch is beautiful, and it perfectly fits both in my wife\u2019s wrist and mine. Their features are also great. The blood pressure, step counter, heart rate work as expected, and the battery last for days. In addition, I was surprised when I read the manual and I found it comes with a O2 meter, route tracking, GPS -which are features that you would see in much more expensive watches. Plus the magnetic charger is a bliss.I cannot come up with any feature or improvement that this watch needs. All in all, EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THIS WATCH!!!!",
            "Connectivity:it disconnects and connects frequently even if mobile is in 6 feet distance.Heart rate:this is what I needed this watch most for. But it\u2019s crappy. It showed me 151 when it was just around 80. Sometimes it shows correct too. I compared with OMRON and I  was not happy with the result.Pedometer:not accurate. Just climbed down one stairs in my home and it showed 116 steps.Sleep:it shows data but cannot confirm.Display brightens up every now  and then. I don\u2019t know if there is a sensor or just a bad touch screen.Today is third day and I still  don\u2019t know how to get phone notifications on watch.Battery life is good. Comfort level is good. Mobile app is not so bad.But I am returning this one.",
            "What i liked: Minimalistic and utilitarian packaging, GPS, pretty reliable HR, SpO2, sleep tracking and notifications, wide viewing angles, circular display that's bright enough under mostly cloudy skies and indoors.What i didn't like: display could've been brighter; touch sensitivity is a bit inconsistent; BP accuracy is questionable. No swimming tracking unless firmware is updated, which it wouldn't let me do.Overall, the Urun is a pretty attractive smartwatch for very less $. \ud83d\udc4d",
            "1- It is a good watch with a nice appearance.2- The Watch App is not secure at all and is downloaded from not safe and anonymous website.3- The App wants to access too many resources on the phone like as files and docs.4- Why does Amazon.ca allow this vendor who wants to have a lot of information from phone devices and accounts and is very insecure?",
            "The watch is actually pretty good, especially for the price I was pleasantly surprised!My only cons are: too big for my tiny wrist and the app needs a lot of improvement.My problem was with the app.  It\u2019s terrible and I got so frustrated with it, I had to return the watch which was a shame....because the watch was great but if I can\u2019t adjust some things on the app so that it\u2019s compatible with the watch, there was no point in keeping it.",
            "Nice looking watch with many features at an attractive price. However, Bluetooth connection problems rendered it unusable in trying to keep track of info. Valid connection when app first installed on phone, but would not sync a second time - and same results when tried with another phone. Deleting and reinstalling app on phone re-established Bluetooth connection, but would not sync after that.Heart rate spiked periodically even though external blood pressure monitor revealed normal pulse rate - not sure whether this would confuse someone as something to worry about if no external blood pressure monitor to verify. This might be related to the watch size on a small wrist, and failing to make a secure fit, as recommended. However, for a woman or smaller individual, this might be a common problem. Also, there did not appear to be an option to store blood pressure on app, although this wouldn't have been a deterrent if the app sync was not an issue for my wife.For someone happy with a stand alone smart watch, this might be worth considering.",
            "En las caracter\u00edsticas t\u00e9cnicas y f\u00edsicas del smartwatch es bueno, es un precio bastante razonable para personas que no quieran invertir en opciones m\u00e1s sofisticadas. Los sensores de ritmo card\u00edaco, saturaci\u00f3n y presi\u00f3n arterial no son muy exactos pero sirven como referencia; el GPS es funcional. El paquete lleg\u00f3 un d\u00eda antes de lo previsto.  Cuesta un poco al principio vincularlo con el Smartphone, pero despu\u00e9s con solo encender el Bluetooth lo vincula en autom\u00e1tico.",
            "Good Product,Works very good:Clock (hehehe),Heartrate,Blood O2,Alarm,Lantern,Message,Weather,Compass.Do not Works very well:Blood Pressure,Sleep Function.NO WORKS AT ALL ON APPLE HEALTHBlood Pressure, Blood O2,I tried the support, but we don't have ANY manual on the website, the support channel asks so many questions to a simple email.It's a good product, BUT if the brand helps the owners will be a greater product.NO MANUAL OR SUPPORT",
            "Was looking to buy a basic watch, but my daughter suggested I invest in something more.  Did not want to pay a lot of money.  Easy to set up, some good widgets (alarms, weather, stopwatch, heart beat).  I like that I can get a notification when I get a text/call (can't answer, but I was not expecting this).  Step counters seems to overestimate.  Not sure the GPS works since it's almost 1.5x milage of my phone GPS.  Also, haven't been able to see actitity reports after being done (looks like it doesn't save data).  It disconnects form my phone very often so I have to reconnect the bluetooth everytime.  The app is very basic, and since its the only app I found to be compatible, it's a bit limiting.  I feel I got what I paid for, but a better app (and maybe an owner's manuel to set up extras) would be great",
            "This little watch comes with ton of features. From weather, alarm, notification from your app like Whatsapp to GPS tracking in your sport to health monitoring like SpO2, blood pressure and heart rate meters. I've been using the blood pressure meter and really happy with the result. You can also control your music app which is convenient.The build quality is excellent and also stylish. But I find it strange to have 2 buttons on the side. It's overkill for me. But the screen is really responsive. You will have no problem navigating to different menu.In term of battery, I can't get the advertised 10days. It only lasts about 6days for me. But that's already much better than my other watch.For the software, the dashboard somehow doesn't show the steps and consumption. I have to click into it to see the details. Hopefully, they will fix it with an update.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0Love the design! Comfortable ,adjustable and light.Obviously you can\u2019t answer your cell with the watch and can\u2019t reply to text but that wasn\u2019t my main purpose for this watch. I needed it to quickly see who\u2019s calling and see the text receive while I\u2019m working on a client. But the watch disconnects from the phone at a very short distance(10\u2019) so you have to have your phone on you. It\u2019s a bit disappointing cuz that was my purpose of this watch but can\u2019t ask to much considering the price. As far as the rest , not too accurate with the heartbeat ( even if very tight on the wrist)Battery life A+Sleep tracking doesn\u2019t work for me but might be doing wrong lol",
            "I have an iPhone & Apple Watch and I\u2019m due for an upgrade on my Apple Watch. I had hoped the Umidigi Urun would be an inexpensive way ($51.99) to get around paying $600 for a new Apple Watch.However outside of battery life, pretty much everything else in this watch is poor performing.Sleep: it only tracked 3-1/2 hours of my last nights sleep. It said I went to bed at 4:52 a.m., where in fact I went to bed at 11 pm. I was accurate for my 8:30 a.m. wake-up time however.Notifications: on day one, all notifications (SMS, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) all worked fine. Today, none are working.The SpO2, heart rate tracking seem to work well so far.Bottom line, is I am sending it back while I can get my $51.99 back and I will probably wait until the Apple Watch 7 comes out in 2021. If you want a cheap low cost smart watch, it\u2019s probably ok. Perhaps some of the deficiencies I mentioned will iron themselves out over time. But if you (like me) are on an iPhone, there really is no substitute for an Apple Watch.",
            "Paired the watch with my phone but it is not reading the correct time or date.  All the other features seem to work fine so that's really disappointing. I've tried resetting to the factory settings, restarting, reinstalling the app etc.  I tried contacting UMIDIGI customer service only to get a form response that they don't support their accessories including Smart Watches and to look at the manual (which is 10 pictures and minimal trouble shooting for Bluetooth connections and that's it.If I don't receive a response from the seller with a solution, I will return it.",
            "So I give it a good try as a GPS running watch (URUN...). Initial quality seems good after box opening but soon I got major issues. Paiactive apps is not even like a BETA version of an app so... its incomplete and unstable. The first OTA firmware update (2021-01-22) render the watch un-usable... (menu mixed up and very bad translation issue) You are not able too choose the language over the app nor in the watch. (It's force by your phone language setup). They add the imperial units option in this update but they completely broke the rest. If you restart the watch you loose step count (in the watch and in the apps....) Maybe resolve with future firmware update. HR seems precise. SpO2 and BP.... Not so sure... The GPS snap real quick with GPS and GLONASS support (This is the best part of it).  You can only export data via STRAVA and GOOGLE FIT. Transfert to STRAVA do not work. The GPS trace is corrupted each time... Work very well with google fit. Very short blutooth range (will see with update).  Also, notifications don't work very well (may change with update). You get a lot of cool option (gadget) for 50$. I will change my review if they do a serious firmware update but.... UPDATE 2021-01-29: They are quick with firmware update (maybe 1 per week so far). French translation issue mainly resolved (This is restoring confidence to the product). Will see with Strava import (they can repair this OTA). Awesome fabrication quality so far, Nice look, Very good battery life.  I will keep it, it will improve....",
            "I am not sure How this watch got such high review its total garbage production and waste of Money. There is only 1 thing positive about watch that is battery time. No call or text notification on the watch its just a cheap quality fit band with very poor resolution. No one knows how accurate is GPS / BPM monitors are.Please dont waste money just received yesterday and already hit the return item",
            "For $60, the look and build quality of the watch is very good. However, the product feels incomplete due to the software. There are bugs here and there that can be easily fixed by a software update. The watch face design is very limited. The music player does not show song info. The watch does not allow users to choose what widget to display on the home screen. The remote camera shutter does not work with any other apps other than their own app.",
            "This Umidigi watch was built with quality and class in mind.  I think it will become an instant classic smart watch .Like many fitness watches the Umidigi Urun smart watch has built in GPS which I will go into details later on.I've had the good fortune of trying out many Umidigi products like phones, earbuds and now watches.The areas I'm going to comment  are on the appearance, the functionality and most important how it feels on me.A watch with brushed chrome casing and a round face makes it looks like  normal Chronograph watch but it's much more as it can be used for casual or formal events with a switch of the face and/or band.Like other fitness watches it comes with step counter but you can choose from many sports for them.  Eg. running, badminton, dance, and walking just to name a few.  The GPS function tracks your sports activities in depth.  More than I can understand.Sleep tracking but this watch breaks down into light, moderate and deep sleep times.It also tracks blood pressure and heart rate and a bonus blood oxygen saturation check.I was able to change music tracks without pulling out my phone and the battery life pretty good even with the GSP on all the time.It was very comfortable to wear without having the edge digging into my wrist or forearm.  The waterproof feature was a pleasant surprise and it didn't stick to my skin when it was wet.This watch has great value and features for a smart watch, all for around $50.",
            "The watch does exactly what it says.  I think it's fairly accurate, the blood pressure is off a bit compared to an actual machine.  It seems to track steps, haven't compared it to any other pedometer or anything like that.  It's not full screen, it's within a circle.  The APP is only ok.  My wife had some issues on her iPhone, I had one on my pixel5, but for the most part it works.  I don't expect anymore for the price.",
            "Pesima opci\u00f3n para comprar o regalar. LA aplicaci\u00f3n tiene funciones que el reloj no. Fue casi imposible colocarle la alarma y por si eso fuera poco a las 5hrs de uso lleg\u00f3 una actualizaci\u00f3n que hizo que el reloj dejara de funcionar.Era un regalo, me dio much\u00edsima pena cuando me lo devolvieron para hacer la devoluci\u00f3n...No cabe dura que lo barato sale caro",
            "It was useless with my phone. The App it uses is called Paiactive. The rating for this App is 2.0 stars on Google Play. Many people have had the same problem with connectivity as I did. Its a good looking watch if you can connect it to your phone. It will not use Da Fit as other Umidigi's do. I am trying another model. Wish me luck.",
            "Stylish watch,both suitable for men and women.The body is made out of stainless steel while the strap is available in silicone.It has a large 1.1 inch TFT curved touch screen with 2.5D glass and 240x240 resolution.  PRO's:Value for money,sporty design,suitable for swimming,built-in GPS,17 sports modes,SPO2 blood oxygen monitor,Bluetooth 5.0,Long battery life.  CONS:No wireless charging.",
            "Great little watchThe app is a little strangely worded, but once you figure it outs, its a breeze to useThe battery lasts a very long time, haven't charged it since I got it, and its been five days, and its still going strong. The coating on the glass is great, it repels water and never gets any fingerprints. Has a ton of settings for different exercises and continually keeps track of your heart rate. Lift to wake is very reliable as opposed to other watches I have owned in the past. The strap is quite nice and the overall build is very sturdy. My favorite feature is that you can control you music playback with it, I use it for that quite often. The flashlight feature which just shows a bright white screen is surprisingly useful. It shows the weather too, though it doesn't seem to be very accurate, at least in my area.Overall its a very good watch, some features like the weather don't great, but everything else is fantastic!",
            "I ordered this watch in error - I wanted to track my SpO2 while sleeping, and this one doesn't do that.  Evidently the Urun \"S\" does that.  Note that the S does not have the GPS built in, but that's ok for me.This was my first smartwatch, so perhaps some of the cons below are normal?PRO:.  Sport mode tracks very nicely, draws a GPS map in the app.  Watch buzzes at every km (I believe that can be shut off).  I only tried the walking mode - steps were reasonably close to what my Samsung Health app in the phone reported.  Plenty of analysis on the walk, such as time per km, distance and steps travelled, speed, average heart rate, calories, steps per minute, pace for each km, etc..  Blood pressure was interesting, unfortunately I had no way to calibrate it, so I put my normal BP into the calibration routine, and it seemed to follow that logically after that..  SpO2 seemed reasonable, varying between 97 and 100%, it measures for several seconds after selected.  Again, nothing to compare with..  Continuous heart rate seems accurate, provides an interesting graph.  However, if you watch it in real time, it jumps unreasonably once in a while, so you just need to eliminate those..  Heart rate detection allows you to set a warning value..  Watch looks classy, and although there are a limited number of time displays, they look good..  Charging cable connects magneticallyCONS;.  Sleep quality was grossly inaccurate.  Some nights it had me in bed at 9pm, even though I was out driving the car at midnight once.  Typically said I was sleeping for 12 hours, when my CPAP would say 7.  It always rated my sleep very good..  SpO2 was manual only, not overnight, but that's my fault, confusing it with the model S.  Showing the time when you raise your arm only worked 50% of the time.  I tried moving my arm several different ways and had to wake it up with the button.  Other times it worked properly..  The alarm has to be set within the app.  You can't set it on the phone, and it does not adopt any alarms you set on your phone.  I did not test to see if it did buzz though when the phone alarm goes off..  The step tracker that is ongoing stopped tracking at noon one day, my phone said 3880 steps, the watch said 346..  Some things a bit hard to find in the app (Paiactive), but could get used to it.  For example, switching to continuous heart rate detection is done under the device tab in the app instead of the heart rate screen..  battery lasted only two days once, other times 4 days.  I suspect the two days was because I was leaving it in SpO2 mode overnight hoping it would monitor continuously (it didn't)..  the charging cable is proprietary, so if you lost it or broke it, not sure how you'd get another.  Although some other watches look like they have a similar cable..  It shows weather, but only the forecast.  I don't know how it knows my local forecast - sometimes it was close to the forecast on my phone, sometimes not, e.g. for the day +2/-20c, where the Environment Canada forecast said +4/-9.  Current weather would be more helpful I would think, but not sure how many watches do that..  Support:  I contacted Umidigi support for clarification about the SpO2 monitoring, and they promised a 48 hour response - that was a week ago, and no reply.Bottom Line:  I'm returning the watch.  I had considered ordering the Urun S as a replacement, but given the list of cons above, will try a different brand.  As an aside, I'm considering:  Totobay (unclear re sleep SpO2 monitored), Mgaolo Fitness Tracker (fitbit style, but lower ratings for accuracy), and the Fullmosa FT.",
            "Terrible GPS accuracy. I tried 2 hikes. 1 for 19k and the other is 22k. Both results show 80% to 100% mileage over. I put it on my desk and make in to run mode. For less than 3 hrs it show ran for 5k+. There is no way I can use it.",
            "This watch itself is fantastic. It measures every single vitals I wanted from heart rate, blood oxygen and blood pressure. As well as all the functions I need for a smart watch. It even has a built in GPS which is insanely cheap for the price. The app will need to have a long way to go though. And it only has 4 watch faces even connected with the app. There is no way to download more. All in all good watch.",
            "Don't like that I have to keep my phone close in order for information to be transferred or to have the info connected. I got this so I didn't have to walk with me phone all the time. Some of the features work perfectly fine as certain times, it hasn't been consistent. Especially the sleep tracking feature. Really wish that it wasn't like this... cute strap and nice rose gold feature.",
            "I have checked the reviews before buying. Too bad I cannot leave zero.My reasons:1. My clock is never with the correct time. It was then stopped synchronizing. I don't know how to update the time.2. My iPhone never finds the watch. I have tried with iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 8.3. Since I can not synchronize and see the time, I feel I have bought a pedometer",
            "I have had an opportunity to use and test the product for a couple of days now.\u00a0 While it has decent features for the price paid, I am finding that the overall execution needs work in several areas and I have returned the item:Appearance - overall I liked the look of the watch with round face and two function buttons.\u00a0 However upon receiving the watch and seeing it in person I am quite disappointed in the size of the large bezel.GPS - During a cycling trip I compared the tracking against a Samsung Gear Fit Pro as well as a Samsung S10e.\u00a0 Both of those devices measured the trip at 5.52km and 5.49 respectively and over time, although not perfect either, I have found them to be fairly accurate.\u00a0 The Umidigi watch measured the same trip at 4.81km which is a significant variance.Paiactive Mobile App - I find the font size very small.\u00a0 I realize that font size can be adjusted in my system settings, however none of the other apps has this problem at the current setting.\u00a0 I shouldn't have to change my system settings for one app to make it readable.\u00a0 In the same vein, I also find the grey font on white background, combined with an even smaller font size again, very difficult to read.Notifications - This is by far my biggest complaint about the device and in my opinion makes the watch almost unuseable.\u00a0 As with the app, the font style and small font size make it impossible to check the notification with a quick/discreet glance, which is the whole point of having notifications on the watch.\u00a0 The notification management is also a MAJOR problem.\u00a0 The app allows you to turn notifications on or off for a number of popular messaging and social media apps as well at toggle for \"other\" which seems to lump all other apps and associated notifications into it.Unfortunatley, this also means system notifications such as charging status!\u00a0 So while your phone is charging the app is continuously vibrating every mintute to tell you this.\u00a0 The same thing happens when your various apps on your phone update in the background.\u00a0 The watch vibrates when the download starts, vibrates again when it installs.\u00a0 Needless to say this gets very annoying quickly.\u00a0 The ONLY way to stop this is to either toggle \"other\" to off or put the watch on Silent Mode.\u00a0 Either option is unacceptable becasuse it will cause you to miss all the other notifications that are useful and actually want.For the price, I didn't have high expectations.\u00a0 I was actually pleasantly surprised and could have overlooked most of the other issues.\u00a0 However, for me the notifications are a fatal flaw.",
            "Muy satisfecho con mi compra, llego en excelente estado, es muy funcional a buen precio. Una desventaja tal vez seria el cable para cargar la pila, es una entrada muy especial y si se rompe no sabria donde conseguir otro cable, por lo demas me encanto, me dura de 5 a 7 dias la pila (con vibracion minima) y las funciones son muy utiles",
            "EDIT TO MY EARLIER REVIEW:While the Umidigi Urun smartwatch is a great product, the App with which it is associated with (Paiactive App) has major issues. Most times, I am not able to connect the smart watch to the App. This reduces the functionality of the smart watch. For this reason, I have reduced my rating from a 5 star to 4 star.*********************************************************************************************************************************I have been very happy with Umidigi products in the past - I currently use the Umidigi F2 Cell phone and am very happy with its price and performance. Because of this I decided to try out the Umidigi Urun smart watch. I have to say that its great value for what it sells for. Its very nice looking and light in weight. It has tons of features and does take a while to get used to it. The pulse measurement is very accurate and matches with other pulse measuring devices. A word of caution for people wanting to use it to measure blood pressure. While it does take blood pressure reading, the results from wrist blood pressure measurement from any device are not as accurate as the ones that measure blood pressure on the arm. Some other interesting features are flashlight, sleep tracker, oxygen level and compass. All of these and many other features work great. My only request to Umidigi is to print the instruction manual in larger font or have a link to a website document that provides more detailed instructions on all the features. Keep up the great work in coming up with more reasonably priced products.",
            "Got the Rose gold colour - looks great / very comfortable and has lots of features with a few drawbacks.Pros- Looks good / comfortable- Measures Heart Rate, Blood Oxygen Level, Blood Pressure- Sleep tracker- Fitness tracker- Lots of other functions- Battery life should be just under a weekCons- Manual isn't very clear (also quite small) - we're still trying to figure out how to work some functions:- Still trying to calibrate the compass & figure out how to use notifications- Weather doesn't seem to work beyond the current day- Android app wasn't available in the app store (had to download via QR link)",
            "So far I'm impressed. Mainly with how well the \"lift to wake\" feature works. Vibration has different levels and the highest one is really strong. Probably go with the softer option to preserve battery.App works great but I did have to search for it in the Play Store. The APK (app installation file) from the QR did not install for me.I have an F1 from Umidigi and it's a steal of a deal and this is no different.",
            "I do quite like all the features of this smart watch. The step count and heart rate seem fairly accurate. The GPS can take a moment to position itself, but then works well. The face is almost too sensitive, even my clothes activate it. The app is somewhat difficult to navigate and instructions for it, and for the features on the watch, are pretty much nonexistent. It's a steep learning curve, but once you figure it out, it works well. The battery though,  it's not great. It claims you get 10 days, and I'm lucky if I get 3 days out of it. Customer service says that 10 days is just approximate,  but that is a huge difference!  Few days here or there is fine, but not a whole week. Having to charge it every 3 days is inconvenient.  And I do tend to charge it every 2 days because it usually doesn't make it through the third day and definitely not a fourth day.",
            "I bought this watch few months ago , I loved it ,although app was useless and I could never sync my info, still I was happy with watch, and battery life wasn't very good. still I was happy with the watch until yesterday my watch died completely , I had it over night for re-charge then in the morning was completely off and dead . I paid aroung 50 had it for few months now I have to threw it to garbage very frustrating. don't purchase the watch doesn't worth it at all.",
            "Besides all the features that the previous versions had, such as heart rate monitor, sleep tracking, sedentary reminder, weather forecast, controlling music player and camera shuttle, call/message notifications for apps like Facebook, Whatsapp, Skype, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and so on, was the GPS that impressed me the most. It is very fast to get the signal, and in terms of accuracy/precision, seems to be very high. For those that want to improve their running/walking performance and at the same time monitoring their health, it is very useful and the price is really affordable. All these features combined with the app really provide an unbiased data assessment for all of the info (with helpful plots and graphs) that it gets from the user.",
            "La montre est vraiment impressionnante pour le prix car il y a beaucoup d'options et le design est vraiment r\u00e9ussi.

Doesn't work without a smartphone having the app to set alarms, set time every now and then. Its tracking is fairly good. the only issue is this watch can not function on its own for a long time without connecting it to a smartphone. seems like it takes smartness from the smartphone and runs for a couple of days before exhausitng the smartness.",

            "On the positive side I received the watch very quickly , within 4 days of placing the order.  The watch looks as advertised , the watch face is quite large but light weight .  However there are no clear instructions on how to set up , sync and use the watch, it's a lot of trial and error . There isn't a lot of trouble shooting instructional videos  on line certainly not from the company . The Paiactive app is not user friendly  . I haven't found a way to personalize the watch face like advertised.  It was very difficult to set up push messaging. I had to manipulate my phone settings a lot , more than I feel comfortable with. I mostly just use it as a watch. Unless you are an IT whiz I would not recommend.",
            "I was loving this watch... Then I uploaded the GPS data and realized how useless it is.

It's doesn't connect to your device well, it doesn't get any notifications from outside apps(like phones calls notification, sms, WhatsApp) nothing, and lastly when you try to get some support, or try to contact umidigi to get the device exchanged NO response.. finally today the watch died IN 3 MONTHS!!! THIS IS A WASTE!!! DO NOT BUY",
            "I was enjoying the watch, if for nothing else than the convenience of the digital clock for quick time references throughout the day.The reminders to drink water or move around were also very helpful since I sit at a desk for most of my day. Inhave only had the watch since the end of January 2021 and I have recently been met with the words APP with an upward facing arrow on my watch screen that will not go away. The watch has no purpose now as it is stuck on this screen. I should mention that this happened not too long after I updated the software, within the same day. At this point, it would be helpful if someone knows how to rectify this issue and can share that information with me; I will be sending it back to be fixed or exchanged.",

I spent hours trying to sync my phone to the watch (and ironically I have a umidigi phone, and I'll never buy a umidigi phone either now), and it never sync.  I tried multiple times, consutled the umidigi website (and don't get me started on the instructions provided with the watch, basically unreadable), and I even watched youtube videosWhat it comes down to is that this brand and watch are valueless product that don't function",

The watch itself is quite attractive and seems well built.  I think the price point on this watch is incredible.  You cannot get something this great at this price.  Well worth the money.  It syncs up nicely to the app on my phone.  Would strongly recommend this to anyone and especially to those who need a smart watch to use during their fitness routines.",

I saw this watch and liked the new feature of SPO2 which was missing from previous watches. The build quality is very good and the watch looks very expensive. The glass of the screen is curved and the feel is very upscale. the watch also has good features and battery life. A great buy, my only suggestion to the manufacturer is to make the screen bigger and provide a nonproprietary charger.",

Have been using it all day already and it feels quite good.The watch is very lightweight and came charged at 75%.Love all the features, cardiac monitor, O2 monitor and even blood pressure!Updated the software and now I have a compass and a flashlight ( screen turning white).Pretty neat, hope there will be more software update to add more features.",

            "Very nice watch. The battery life seems to last about a week without charging, so this functions really well even as a regular watch. The housing also seems fairly solid and should last. Works great as an all-day heart rate monitor and sleep tracker through their Paiactive app (albeit a bit difficult to install on an Android). I really like the message notification feature, as I can just look at that without bringing out the phone. Overall, it is a really good purchase for $60.",

The Uwatch 3 had a lot more options, like setting the do not disturb for certain times...the urun has to be set everytime. Urun definitely has a better sleep tracker though. The watch is really pretty good it just needs an app update to make it perfect.",
            "The watch itself is decent. Value for the money. The strap is not very high in quality but the centre dial looks good.However, the features on the watch and the software rank slightly lower than the other products around the same price point. Especially, the software (app) is not very intuitive and also lack of the ability to add/customize watch faces is big negative.",

This time I thought lets try to get out from the Apple eco-system & try Garmin.Garmin Fenix 6X Pro is good. Battery is okay, but not as per my expectation. My expectation was very high after I read their brochure. It's battery indicator is rubbish. If today it shows 20 days, next day it shows 8 days. I know how to use battery saver, but when I see how much battery left, I want to belive it. Apple watch does that perfectly.Otherwise, the watch is really good. I am enjoying it.",
            "Upgraded from a Fenix 5 to the 6X Pro. Larger clearer screen is a great improvement. Great battery life. The Spotify app sync is great so I no longer need to train with my phone. A little bit of setup required. Watch works perfectly with Apple AirPod Pros. I had some issues connecting to Wifi from the watch initially. Easiest fix is to make sure older legacy B/G device support was enabled on the wireless access point you are connecting to. I was connecting to a Ubiquiti wireless access point. Also I then needed to reset watch to factory defaults before trying to connect to wifi again. Maybe this issue will be fixed in future watch firmware release. Working perfectly since I made those changes. Overall very happy with the 6X Pro so far.",

It was much smaller than I was expecting having read many people's comments, and although I have relatively small hands and wrists, I still was surprised at how small and comfy it is.When the Ticwatch Pro GPS was released, I liked the new swimming feature. Having a swimming pool, I wanted to be able to not have to work about taking it in the water. The Pro 2020 is water proof but it's not recommended that you swim with it.When I received the watch (a couple of days after ordering it) I was surprised to see the OS skin was different from the previous iteration. The animations were very smooth and a nice touch. The display also seems slightly crisper and brighter, but that could need my imagination.Done people have commented on the bezel around the screen, but I would have not noticed it had someone not mentioned it and it certainly doesn't impact the display.Even with all of the features enabled (24 hour heart rate be and SpO2), the battery life exceeds the 2020 by around a day. I tend to charge my devices every night so it doesn't impact me but it's nice to know I can continue to use it if I spend a night away without the charger. The new Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100 processor obviously has an impact on this longer battery life, being more efficient. Have I noticed it being more responsive than the 2020 model? Not really but this is probably due to the 2020 being fast in its own right.The charger has been miniaturised which means it would take up very little room in a bag but I do prefer the previous type as it was like a mini dock (same size as the watch), keeping your phone flat and level. You could just place it on the dock and the magnets would attach automatically. The new charger has to be placed in a specific place making it a little less convenient. First World problems!The watch is smaller and lighter than the 2020. One night when testing the sleep function, I couldn't tell if I had the watch on my wrist and had to feel to see if I had put it on. The new strap is all silicone (the 2020 had a hybrid leather/silicone combo). This makes it lighter and more comfortable. I guess they dropped the leather due to it being designed to be submerged which may have made it deteriorate over time but that's just a guess.Another new welcomed feature is the backlight for the LCD secondary screen. A flick of the wrist will either turn the back light on or, if you change a setting, the main display will turn on. I tend to keep the back lit LCD option as it is very easy to view in most lighting conditions, has essential information on all of the time and saves battery life. To wake up the main display, simply touch the screen or button.The Mobvoi software is very good and is my go to when exercising (over Google's own). It's not as good as the software for my Jabra Elite buds which overlays your running route on a map, but once again, it is easy to navigate and has enough basic information to make it useful. It also links with the miriad of sensors so all of your stats are in one place. I took it out on a bike ride and compared it to the Garmin. There was a slight variation between the 2 but that was down to the auto start/stop features suffering slightly on each device. Happy with both results.I have tested the other built in apps and have found them to be either useful (sleep monitor has been good due to having sleep apnoea) or a bit of fun (Tichearing monitors the ambient sound in decibels).Mobvoi has been one of the best companies that I have dealt with in a long time. They will answer emails within a day, 95% of the time. They don't always have the answer straight away but they keep in touch until any issues have been resolved. I even recurved a phone call (supposedly from California) to resolve an issue which was a nice touch.This watch has all of the features (and more) of some of the top end, mainstream branded ones at a fraction of the cost. It is perfect? No. There are some features which would have made it even better i.e. wireless charging, Military Standard 810G (like the 2020 model) etc but even without these, this watch is still very impressive.Would I recommend this watch? Absolutely. If you have ANY issues, Mobvoi will resolve the issue as customer satisfaction is high on their priority list.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0This new version of Ticwatch is more than I expected. It is super quick thx to new Qualcomm\u00ae Snapdragon Wear\u2122 4100 Platform and increased memory. There is no lag at all. It still have dual screen which I love, it is excellent feature which helps to safe battery. Comes with preloaded Ticwatch apps (Tic health, Tic exercise, Tic pulse, Tic Sleep, Tic Zen, Tic Hearing, Tic breathe and Tic oxygen), Watch strap has been redesigned compare to Ticwatch Pro. This new watch strap is very soft and comfortable. The band to hold the watch strap has a notch from underneath so it doesn't move and that is a great innovation as the band on Ticwatch Pro original leather bands were constantly moving. You can also change the watch strap to anything else you like. I have managed to get little over 3 days of battery life and that was with sleep tracking ON. It is very light and with the new watch strap I almost don't feel that I'm wearing the watch. I can highly recommend this watch and Ticwatch as their customer service is perfect ( My old Ticwatch Pro needed new charger and Ticwatch has send replacement free of charge within a couple of days )",
            "I have the Ticwatch Pro and that was a great smartwatch but I found that to be a little slow to react. It was troubled by a then out of date processor and only a small amount of RAM. Having upgraded to this newer version, it's like night and day! This is a fantastic watch! I've used it for about two weeks now and haven't noticed anything I regret about replacing my old one. Here's a few things I've noticed:Design: This is noticeably lighter so feels more natural on the wrist. It also has a slimmer form factor so any clothing slides over it easily. I also prefer this strap over the previous version as the consistent feel on the top and the bottom is better than leather on the top and rubber on the bottom (of the older one I had).Use: This has that great secondary screen feature that means the battery lasts ages! I've used this watch day to day, running and cycling and it's handy to be able to see the key bits of information like time, speed etc instead of having to reach for a button to get this info. The main screen in colour is also really vibrant and good to use in the sunSoftware: Wear OS runs much much smoother on this newer watch and has no noticeable lag. That was my main gripe with the first Ticwatch Pro. I like the 2 rows of apps when pushing the top button and the bottom button short cuts to Ticwatch's fit software. I used both Ticwatch and Google Fit and the GPS and mapping of exercise routes was picked up easily by both. Choose which one you prefer as the look and feel of each exercise app is different and it's good to have optionsTicwatch Apps: I'm not one to usually use many extra apps but I gave the Ticwatch ones a go. TicSleep - it's good to have a native sleep app now as there doesn't seem to be a decent one on the Wear OS app store. TicZen is a relaxation app which measures your state of relaxation. TicBreath tells you when to inhale and when to exhale to get you into a relaxed state. TicHearing measures the sound around you and warns you of unsuitable levels. There's TicOxygen which measures your blood oxygen levels and lastly there's a hand wash timer for how long you should be washing your handsOverall Summary: If you're after a cracking Wear OS watch then this is it. It's stylish, has a great battery and is packed with modern tech. What's more it runs Wear OS so you have access to Google's smartwatch apps. There's a lot of watch faces to choose from, either from Ticwatch or Google so you can customise the look even more.",
            "I purchased the original Ticwatch Pro back in 2018 and so have done a comparison of the new Ticwatch Pro 3 and the original version to see how things have improved.Firstly, the physical differences:On taking the new one out of the box, the first thing I noticed was how much slimmer and less chunky looking it was than the original. Then, once I put in on my wrist, the difference was immediately clear. The Pro 3 feels very light on my wrist. (New 41.9g, old 58.5g) It almost feels like I don't have a watch on at all.  The new strap also feels nice against my skin. And the buttons have a nice tactile feel to them. You can see the physical differences in the photos. The differences are so obvious, I don't even need to say which one is which.One other great improvement is the charger. I had problems with the charger for my old Ticwatch Pro, which Mobvoi replaced for me free of charge. The connection of new charger has a much tighter feel.Secondly, the software:With double the RAM and storage of the original version, and the Snapdragon 4100 chipset, the performance is silky smooth. Setup and pairing with my phone was a breeze. Out of the box, one firmware update was waiting, along with some app updates. I have used the improved TicHealth suite of apps and found them all to work well. I really like the blood oxygen sensor. Quite a timely addition during the coronavirus pandemic.Overall, the Ticwatch Pro 3 is a real improvement over the original version; it's like night and day. And with it being the first watch to sport the Snapdragon 4100 chip, I say you can't go wrong with this.",
            "As a one-sentence-summary, I am completely happy with the Ticwatch Pro 3.Prior to this, I've owned the original Ticwatch Pro (whose screen I unfortunately smashed), and the Ticwatch Pro 2020.  I still have the 2020, and it still works fine.  I'm just unlikely to ever wear it now, unless I'm doing something where I need a watch, and don't won't to risk my Pro 3.  The biggest question in my mind when buying this one was, will there be enough of a difference from the 2020 that this isn't me just wasting my money?  I've had it for a few weeks now, and I have zero buyer's remorse.  Everybody is different, but for what it's worth, here's my review...Physically, the Pro 3 is a smaller and lighter watch than the previous two versions.  It's not a huge difference on paper, but you see it and feel it.  The 3 looks more refined (less chunky) and it feels better on my wrist if I'm wearing it all day.  With the old format, you could kind of never forget you had it on, but this design is very comfortable.The screen on the 3 looks a bit sharper.  I'm not sure if it's just psychological, but it just seems a touch nicer than my 2020.  There is a black ring between the bezel and the display.  I don't really notice it unless I'm looking for it, but it's worth noting, because the display on the old design ran right up to the bezel.Performance-wise it's no contest.  Not even close.  The Pro 3 is way more responsive and smooth than the previous models.  The new processor is a definite upgrade that helps the interactions just work.  The default app layout is two column instead of one, so there's less scrolling, and the icons are more substantial.Battery life is fantastic.  The quoted 72 hours is no joke.  I run the display in smart mode with tilt-to-wake, and I'm running both the heart rate and Oxygen monitoring all the time.  So far there's been no trouble going 3 days, and even a little beyond, between charges.Bluetooth!!  My biggest gripe about both the Pro and Pro 2020 was their annoying tendency to break connection with my phone.  This was especially likely if the battery ran down fully before I charged it again.  The Pro 3 Bluetooth has been rock solid so far, without any special setup.  It just works.  I've even deliberately run the battery down to test it, and it still reconnects on its own as soon as it's recharged.  This is one of two changes that made me particularly happy.The second small/big thing that I really liked was the buttons.  I took a pic to compare, and it's kind of hard to see, but they made a slight change to the button position.  Effectively, the two buttons now sit at a wider angle from each other, and the space between them is just a tad larger.  Why is this such a big deal?  Because (for me anyway) it means when I bend my wrist, to rise out of a chair or lean on a table, the back of my hand doesn't mash the buttons anymore!  No more waking Google Assistant or powering off the watch by accident.  It's fantastic!  Seriously, kudos to whoever on the design team came up with that one.The last thing, and this is the closest to a negative that I've got, is the strap... Meh.  It's fine.  I did like the look of the previous leather/rubber hybrid a bit better.  But I have to admit, this one is comfy, and it will definitely be easier to keep clean, so I can't bash it too hard.Anyway, as I said at the beginning, I'm totally happy.  I think this is the last smartwatch I'll need for a while.",
            "Its a good watch with bad build quality. The core design is good and the price is right but save your money cause I've tried 3 of these so far and they've all failed within the first year. And it isn't even just one thing. The first one had RAM issues, kept getting stuck when I tapped the screen. (2) had battery issues. Started dying in 4 hrs at 30% battery after 2 months. And now (3) has sensor failure. The sensor array on the back just stopped working one day. I'm a pretty careful user and the none of the watches had physical damage, they were just poorly built.Also, the seller blatantly disregards Australian Consumer Law. So much so, that when I made my case with links to the ACCC's website(thinking they were simply unfamiliar), they just ignored my mesaages and kept replying with the same default message. Thankfully Amazon had me covered.",
            "I really wanted to like this watch, I did for 2 weeks. Everything was perfect. And then all the sensors died. A lot of people are in the same boat, but Google reviews just don't seem to bring up the issues people are having with this particular TicWatch, the other ones are fine as far as I know. I really wanted to endorse them because the watch was great, but it will be hard to sell me on TicWatch/Mobvoi in the future.",
            "Had this for a bit over two weeks now and love it. I've never been fond of synthetic bands but this feels OK and looks pretty good. The display is great - I've only tried a few watch faces so far but those all work well and look good on the fairly high resolution display. Even though I use \"always on\" (main display, not the LCD) I'm only charging every 3 days. So far, I'm really happy with it.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0So far there's not much about this watch I don't like. It's comfortable, stylish and blends in very well with any style of clothes. The duel screen setup is excellent and saves a lot of battery life. The new snapdragon wear processor really makes google wear os usable and mobvoi have a very friendly user interface to go with it. Definitely recommend giving it a look!Warning: Toddlers will try to take this off your arm with brute force, the different screens are like lights to a moth",
            "Great watch for what little use I have had. 1 week and then the charge cable wouldn't charge. I checked the Mobvoi site and couldn't find one to replace. I ordered one from a third party vendor which should arrive this week. The reason I chose not to contact Mobvoi and instead pay for my own replacement charger, is that they would want me to send it back for warranty. I live in Australia so to wait for two lots of international shipping would take months. I'll update when I have used it longer.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0I've had a few smart watches and this is easily the best. I think it's a pretty good looking watch with the fake leather band (which of course is replacable if you don't like it). It feels good and works really well. There's no waiting as it's very snappy. I use the always-on display and have turned all sensors on (continuous 24-hour where applicable) and I generally still have about 70% battery left at the end of the day, depending on what I do. I love that you can scroll through your notifications one-handed by just flicking your wrist (see attached video). The default screen shown during my daily walk/run is simple but shows all the essential info in one screen; no need to swipe through different pages while walking.I use the \"OurGroceries\" app for shopping lists and I've downloaded this to my Ticwatch. Now I can wander around the shops without having to hold my phone in one hand, crossing things off as I go on my watch, which updates the list on my wife's phone in real time. How cool?Definitely recommended and I would buy the same thing again without hesitation.",
            "A good watch but full of annoying bugs which still have not been fixed, such as putting the phone into theatre mode (as there is no way to automatically turn off the watch face light at night) meaning you can't turn off your alarm in the morning, watch just keeps vibrating.",
            "I have a small wrist, and even though this is a large watch, it doesn't appear over large, on. I'm really happy with it so far. I haven't pushed the battery to allow it to deplete completely, and it charges up reasonably quickly. The smoothness of screen changes is great, although scrolling through the app screen could be better. The one thing I would say needs the most work is the instructions. They're pretty basic. But there are a lot of online forums and such that will give you tips etc, but it would be nice if you didn't have to. Must have apps are Facer and Watchmaker for watch faces. The mobvoi app also needs work. Overall I'm happy with my purchase.",
            "My first wear OS watch, it actually surprised me. Really happy with this purchase.Dual layer screen is a big plus, see clearly in the sun, snappy touch screen and save a lot of battery, for my average usage it gets up to three days . I don't use sleep tracking btw.Google pay is another nice feature to have, really convenient.Just wish this has wireless charging.",
            "Have been using it for a few weeks now. I had a ticwatch last year and returned it as battery life was woeful. It is better but maybe I only get a day and a half out of it. I don't have always-on display on, tilt, always on screen is turned OFF. was hoping better, but I suppose this may be the best available :( Honestly thinking to go back to my amazfit GTR",
            "After watching and reading reviews I decided to get this to replace the Samsung Watch I had for years (its battery was starting to go quickly). Battery life was a big feature which drew me to the Ticwatch. The battery life is excellent! I also like the 2nd screen that looks like a basic LCD screen, nice a simple that I can see quickly what time it is. I also like that it uses Android Wear OS. Set up has bee fairly easy too. Highly recommend the watch! It just works!",
            "Being my first smartwatch, I always wanted one which I need not keep charging every day, It's been a week since this beauty arrived, the watch ran for 3 whole days! This is the best battery experience you\u2019ll get from any Wear OS watch by some distance. Size fits perfectly on my wrist. Mobvoi has made a masterstroke with Snapdragon Wear 4100 and a huge 577mAh cell. TicWatch Pro 3 surely raises the bar for Wear OS smartwatch performance and battery life.",
            "Very happy with the TicWatch Pro 3 so far. It\u2019s comfortable, looks great and all the functionality that I need. Battery is going good as 2 days into wearing and it still has over 50% battery life. I think this is great considering it\u2019s been heavily used due to set up and the novelty of a new product so I\u2019ve given it a fair old workout. My previous Smartwatch was lucky to last 24hrs so the TicWatch Pro 3 seems to be far superior.",
            "Watch works great and looks fantastic. The battery life is good as well. As a fitness tracker it's not great. It has recorded my pulse inaccurately multiple times as well as recording my walking speed as 12km/h! The sleep tracking is nowhere as good as a fitbit. My advice would be if you're after a reasonable priced smart watch this is good. If you want a go fitness tracker get a Garmin or Fitbit.",
            "This is the best wear OS watch you can buy right now. It has a great double display, fast refresh rate and fastest processor to make for the best wear OS experience. The battery life is excellent I easily get as least 2 days with all the monitoring sensors turned on.",
            "I'm really enjoying the health data tracking on this Ticwatch,What is impressive is the battery life - very good! Easily lasts  3 days and rhen recharges superfast. Highly recommended.",
            "I love this watch. It has all the features that I need. It will also get the new OS update that Google is working on.",
            "Did a lot of research before pulling the trigger. The Ticwatch Pro 3 is the best Wear OS watch out. Smooth, amazing battery life. Can't complain.",
            "I got this to answer calls because i cant access my phone easily while working. Having the watch direct the call to my phone entirely defeats the purpose",
            "Great watch, looks good functional and battery life  is at least 2 days",
            "Love the many watch faces! Great functionalities, easy to set up and use! Overall rating 9/10.",

It disconnects from phone after charge for some reason. The most bothersome thing is the battery life, to use it all day, I need to charge it 2-3 times, it charges fast, in less than one hour, even with extended wear feature and dim brightness, still is extremely poor, nowhere near 18 hour battery life advertized, 8 hours at best. It\u2019s really sad since I wanted to like this watch because of its nice look, but they really need to make watches with better battery life.",

            "I bought this watch because it looked nice for professional looking accessory and give me the smart watch options. I find most smartwatches so ugly.Anyway, lots of features but I hardly know how to use any of them.The Bluetooth drains the battery like mega crazy. And that\u2019s after having to reconnect my phone to my watch dozens of times a day. Very frustrating.I wish it gave me the option to look at my step count the next day or a few days after to see where I peaked or lacked throughout the week, but as soon as midnight rolls around, it resets back to zero steps and you can\u2019t go back to check.I wish there were more watch face options that looked like analog watches or more feminine. Most are quite masculine. Also, if I could modify faces on my phone app, that would be so awesome.I find the strap comfortable and don\u2019t have any issues with it. I did remove a few links before I could wear it.Some of the functions are found in multiple spots and some only in one which is a little confusing.I would buy again if they fixed the Bluetooth connection issue and the Bluetooth eating battery issue.Nice looking watch!",

For texting you can speak to text or it has a tiny keyboard, which isn't to hard to use, but speak to text is better. I get ring doorbell notifications with pictures I get email notifications with the open to quick view, but you have to open fully on your phone. I'm loving this watch! Very crisp and clear!",

I would have returned it just because of that but with the price I paid for it, I may as well keep it. Overall I do like the functions of the watch, it does what it is supposed to do.  The huge issue with this watch is the battery life.  I do not have the heart rate option running 24/7.  I have the screen off until I wake it up.  I do not have any apps running constantly.  And the battery drains SO FAST!  It was at 100% when I went to sleep last night.  While in Do Not Disturb mode overnight, it was at 54% this morning.  2 hours later, it is currently at 37 without even using it.Update: I did mess around with the customize battery and I have it to where it only drains about 10% overnight on do not disturb mode and throughout the day it lasts till about 45% when I go to bed.  I did change it to 4 stars because I did make the situation better. But I still HATE the gold.  I wish it was more pink like in the listing picture.",
            "I've had my watch Less Than 3 months. I loved it! It synched well with my Samsung Note and worked perfectly until a couple of days ago. Started cycling on and off at random times. Now it continues to cycle on and off repeatedly every minute and the watch is getting hot. Fossil said they will cover it under their warranty, however their customer service is poor in my opinion. I have to ship the watch to them at my cost and pay for shipping insurance and proof of delivery. Repair can take 4 to 6 weeks. If they can't fix it, then they will supposedly provide me a new one. In the meantime, I have no watch for a month and a half. I am not happy! Too bad not all companies have the great customer service that Amazon does!!",

My watch has been displaying an odd messed up screen and cycling between that and the clock screen. The screen is not turning off. The battery is dying quickly due to it not turning off. It is probably broken/defective. I had a Fossil smart watch before this and liked it. I had an issue with that watch and customer service/repairs was good on their word and got my first watch fixed. I will reach out to customer service again to get this one repaired as well.  Unless they give me trouble honoring the warranty which I don't think the will I will still continue to recommend Fossil watches as with the except of defects they are good quality and their warranty service is good. I'll update if issues with warranty process."

            "The watch face is the width of 2 US quarters and the height of 8 stacked US quarters. The watch will fit up to an 8.3\u201d wrist with no links removed. The watch weighs 5.5 ounces. This is a bulky watch for guys who like that industrial vibe.  I provided photos with US quarters to give you a better idea of size (the reference to US currency is easiest to compare to your existing watch.)The heart rate monitor is accurate compared to my blood pressure monitor, so that\u2019s good.  All of the apps link to Google accounts, I set up with iPhone in about 25 minutes.  The face is pretty responsive to touch.  I haven\u2019t had it long enough to opine on longevity, but I hope the sizing information was helpful to your purchase decision.",
            "It's hard to tell in the pictures just how thick the watch is - it's not for small wristed people, or if you don't like a big watch. It's not overly large, just very \"present\".  I do like a larger watch display, just not a large, clunky metal band. My Diesel watch is gunmetal with a gunmetal band. The metal band was just too much for me, so I purchased a color coordinating Barton band on Amazon for $20 - matches perfectly and is so much more comfortable. The watch is rated ATM5 so pairing it with a silicone band means I can swim, take a shower, wash dishes, etc without worry.You'll need to download the Google Wear OS app to sync it with your phone. I already had it installed and am familiar with it as I own several other smartwatches on the Wear OS platform. The Diesel On is definitely the fastest and most responsive watch that I have used. Most apps load or display data as soon as you select them and the Google Assistant prompts and replies relatively quickly (after the first use - the first time is always sluggish). I was not fond of any of the pre-installed Diesel watch faces so I installed Facer and selected one of those - thousands of free ones to choose from.The battery last all day with some left over. I'm not a heavy watch user, mostly to quickly review text messages while driving, checking the time and I have used Google Pay several times. It's pretty cool at the grocery store checkout - just waiving your watch paying wirelessly! The NFC range is generous, I had no problems with it being accepted at several merchants.Overall this is a nice looking, rugged and sophisticated watch that will most likely last for several years. I look forward to wearing it - probably more often now as it's much more responsive and has many more features than previous models.",
            "The Diesel On DZT2017 men's Axial touchscreen stainless steel smartwatch, with movement and band made in China, includes a rapid charging cable and uses Google\u2019s Wear OS.  The watch has a stainless-steel case and an interchangeable link metal band.I already had a smartwatch, so instead of downloading the Google Wear app, I just needed to add this watch to the device list.  The next issue was that the band was too big for my wrist.  The band may be changed out for any 24mm band, or remove links to get the sizing right.  I chose the latter and bought a cheap\u00a0\n\nwatch band link remover tool\n\n  .Once connected the smartwatch is intuitive to use.  Swiping up shows notifications where basic actions may be taken when selected.  Swiping right shows Google Assistant while swiping left shows Google Fit.  Swiping down shows the settings options.  There is a \u201cwinding\u201d button on the side which can be used to scroll up or down depending on which way the button is turned.  Additionally, pressing the button wakes the watch to view the dial.  The watch can also be set to auto turn on when lifted to view. There is a push button on either side of the \u201cwinding\u201d button, the top is used to alter operating modes, while the bottom button opens google fitMy old smartwatch didn\u2019t have a speaker or mic but worked well enough.  I tried using the phone feature on the Axial smartwatch and discovered I prefer to use my phone for calls.  I set the Axial Smartwatch to answer calls only.  I like the addition of tones to alert to calls and notifications though.The only feature I miss is automatic sleep tracking.  This should be a Google OS feature but isn\u2019t.  I have Runtastic installed on my old watch, but they discontinued the watch app so I cannot install it on the Axial smartwatch. There are alternatives, however all the ones I found require setting sleep tracking on an off manually.  Yeah\u2026 not gonna happen with me.  Experience is showing me that I need automatic sleep tracking.The Diesel On DZT2017 men's Axial smartwatch is a big improvement on the\u00a0\n\nSkagen\u2019s men's SKT5104 smartwatch\n\n  . The fitness tracking and notification handling work well in a user-friendly way.  I just wish I still had the automatic sleep tracking.  However, that is an app issue that will likely be an issue on any Google OS smartwatch. If you\u2019re looking for a reliable full-featured smartwatch, the Diesel On DZT2017 men's Axial smartwatch is a great option to consider.\u25ba PROS:Compatible with Android and iPhoneSwim-proof up to 50m deep1-hour rapid charge battery which lasts up to 24 hoursIncludes speaker and mic8GB storageGoogle assistantFitness trackingSimple to use\u25ba CONS:No sleep trackingWatchband may need to be sized or replaced",
            "The Axial smartwatches are powered by Qualcomm's latest Wear 3100 processor, which promises better performance and longer battery life. They also have a heart rate monitor, GPS, an NFC chip for Google Pay, and Google Assistant for weather updates, calendar appointments, reminders, and more.Additionally, each watch comes with a few pre-installed apps, including Google Fit, Spotify, Noonlight, and Cardiogram.  You can use other apps on it, I had a few that I tried loading that I use on my Note 8 and some worked, some didn't.This Diesel On Axial smartwatch feels like the most durable of the ones that I have looked at. The 44mm stainless steel case is 12mm thick and features rivets along the bezel that gives it a rugged look. On top is a 1.28-inch display with 328 pixels per inch and a variety of animated watch face options.  The wrist strap is 24mm wide.  I loaded a screen app that gave me a simple Digital Time/Date as I found the ones that came with it both overly frenetic and used too much power.The smartwatch is available in a few different colors, including gunmetal, silver, and a bronze-tone stainless steel that you can match with either a black leather, blue denim, or gunmetal stainless steel strap.  I have the gunmetal with the stainless steel strap.  I found it difficult to get the strap sized to my wrist, which is about 6.5\" in circumference.  People with larger wrists will find it easy to size, I ended up ordering a Barton silicone strap to use with it.  The Barton strap lowers the weight of the watch by 2 oz. which is a lot, very comfortable and you can get colors to match your watch.  I got the black with red inside and it looks really impressive.The watch's speaker supports phone calls; Fossil's proprietary app allows both Android and iPhone users to take calls right from their wrists.  Since I wear hearing aids, this is not a feature that will work in some environments for me.  I have tried linking it up to my Bluetooth hearing aid device, but it keeps defaulting to my phone.  It does let you answer the phone from your watch so you don't have to pull out your phone to see who is calling.  Since my phone number is public due to my business, I get a lot of spam calls . . . hint, get Truecaller to block those, works great.Thanks to the Qualcomm 3100 Wear chipset, the Diesel smartwatch has four battery modes: Extended Battery Mode (lasts multiple days on a single charge with access to only essential features); Daily Mode (enables most features); Custom Mode (allows you to manage battery settings yourself); and Time-Only Mode (only tells time). I have tried to gauge the time each works, Daily Mode barely makes it through my day so Extended Mode seems to be my best choice as it seems to make it at least two days.  One of the great features is the charger that can bump it back up quickly if your watch is running slow.  The only question I wanted an answer too is where I get a second charger cable which is proprietary -- finally learned to order one from Fossil who actually makes the watch.  I will have one for travel and one that stays by my bed.  Note this watch is so big and heavy with the original metal link band there is no way I would wear it to sleep, now with the Barton band it is fine . . . you can add a sleep tracking app if you want.Charging is really fast.  I put it on the charger every morning as I eat breakfast and it is completely charged by the time I finish my coffee.This is a big, heavy, durable watch.  Note that you can dive with it as it is supposedly good to 160'.",
            "I was first attracted to this smartwatch based on its awesome looking display. It looks like the inside of a computer or something, but it looks pretty cool. It has a lot of great features that are typical of smartwatches. The screen display is very easy to read when either just checking the time or using the various apps. Some of the many features it has include: heart rate & distance tracking, Google Pay, receive notifications and alerts, check calendar, change music, etc. The watch both looks and feels durable in the Gunmetal color that I got. The one area that I thought this watch is lacking is the battery life. It claims to have a 24 hour battery life that can be extended up to two more days in low power mode. I seem to get about 12 hours of daily usage out of the watch, which is a far cry from the alleged 24 hour battery life. So it gets me through the day for the most part, but I have had it die on me several times before the day is even over. I feel this could be an excellent watch if they were able to improve the battery life, although it does charge rather quickly. Overall this is a pretty cool looking smartwatch that's loaded with features, but at this price you might want to consider the shorter battery life based on your estimated usage before deciding to purchase.",
            "This smartwatch from Diesel is one of the nicest looking watches I own and gets frequent compliments. The only downside I\u2019ve found is as other iPhone users have mentioned \u2013 the interaction with Google\u2019s Wear OS app can be frustrating.The stainless steel gun metal gray case Smartwatch looks very cool. The underside of the case that sits against your wrist is plastic. I\u2019ve had issues with other smartwatches in the past where this pops off. It\u2019s something to keep an eye on \u2013 especially if you\u2019re planning to use this watch during physical activity. Once the back pops off, that\u2019s all she wrote. There is also a textured red band that runs around the side of the case My watch came with a gun metal gray linked band. Unless you have the tools to pop out the links, you\u2019ll need the assistance of someone at a local jewelry store. Also included in the packaging is a separate matching buckle to use in the event you want to swap out the band with one made of leather, plastic, etc. And lastly, you get the standard watch charging cable.The touch screen is flat, not convex like many other watches. If you have a watch that uses Google\u2019s Wear OS, you\u2019ll see the same familiar options and have the ability to swap and download watch faces. There are also some user-friendly watch face creation apps out there that will work with this as well. Taping the crown (the dial) twice will open up options for you \u2013 where you\u2019ll see the main menu, giving you options such as settings, dial effects, Find my iPhone, your agenda, and Google Fit, among several other items. This is also where you can update connectivity. This is where the Wear OS software is lacking. If you\u2019re connecting to an Android device, you\u2019re good; connecting to an iPhone is frustrating, as the connection is dropped more often than not. The watch, however, will still run, and interface with you. You just won\u2019t be able to sync if for additional connectivity, unless you\u2019re in a Wi-Fi zone.The watch comes in a square leather box that really makes for a nice presentation. In addition to the watch and the other pieces I mention above, you also get a set-up manual, as well as a user manual in several different languages. The box is definitely worth holding on to. It can be used to not only house your watch when not using it, but as a nice place for keepsake items.Battery life is good and will get you through the day, maybe two. So you\u2019ll need to keep the charging cord with you on trips. One interesting feature was the battery saver option that allow you to adjust the power draw on our watch, limiting features you might not use.Overall \u2013 a very nice watch that you can wear on any occasion (dressy or casual) that will leave a nice impression. The only drawback is the Bluetooth connectivity with the iPhone. Once the Wear OS app is fixed to address this, this will be a stellar watch.",
            "Diesel On Men's Axial is a work of art. It has a larger than average size and weight about it with a Steam Punk gun metal design. Wearable OSs has improved markedly since my last smart watch and this is very much on evidence in how smooth, quickly and effectively this Axial works. It has a beautiful assortment of faces to choose from with the default classic Steam Punk styled one being my personal favorite. It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionality which latches easily onto my phone, head-phones and my home theatre. I was able to easily control most my network devices with this watch. It also has a speaker phone in it enabling the user to talk directly into it; I felt like Dick Tracy when using this feature! It comes with a charger and charges rather quickly, but discharges more rapidly than I would like. I would nonetheless mention that the charge is better than my prior smart-watch and once you learn how to use it efficiently, the battery time can last longer. The watch claims 8 gigs of memory and 1 gig of ram. This gives it clean and smooth the graphics far superior to earlier such devices and a touchscreen that\u2019s very accurate quite responsive. Its keyboard is likewise larger and more accurate than I found in earlier generations of smart-watches. If you have $350 to spend on a smart watch, then this should be at the top of your list of options.",
            "My husband hadn't worn a watch in ages!  He used to want one of those fancy GPS watches, when he was in the military, but ever since he got out he hasn't really worn any.  He's always talking about how he wanted a Dick Tracy style watch, but that he was holding off until they got all the kinks worked out.  While we haven't been able to get him talking over the watch, it's nice for everything else it can do.  If you use wi-fi for calling, this watch will not allow you to talk over it.  It seems to make the voice go in and out, if you try wi-fi calling.  We haven't had the opportunity to test this with cellular service, but that's just due to our location.  Other than that, every other function of this watch works great.  My husband mostly likes the additional features like being able to see the weather quickly, his HR, and to see notifications.  I would say notifications are his favorite aspect.  He can quickly see Discord messages pop up, and easily dismiss them.  Watch function works nicely.  You can change the design of the face, by going into the app.  Had to take this to a professional in order to get it fit properly.  Considering the price of this thing, it's worth the $10 charge.  You don't want to be hammering on this in your garage.  On that note, be sure to get a screen protector for this thing.  It's super in-expensive, and worth it.  You don't want to wear this for a few days, and end up with a scratch on the face.  I got one that just had me squirt some water on it, and drop this glass protector on.  I can't even tell it's on, unless I scrutinize it.  Considering this was an impulse grab for him, I'm excited at how much he loves this thing.  I'm just worried that he's going to want more watches.  Watches with touch screens.  Expensive watches with touch screens.  Help me now!!BTW.  This thing is built like a tank.  It's solid, and there is nothing that makes me think something might snap off or otherwise break easily.",
            "If you like large watch faces and Google's Watch OS, this is a good choice for a watch. The face itself is huge which is good for us guys with diminishing eyesight. I have to hold a watch farther away from my face than I did five years ago, but this watch isn't that bad.Since this is a Diesel watch no one is going to look at it and mistake it for another brand because Diesel is unique. They make big beefy watches that are built like tanks.The watch features a snapdragon 3100 cpu and a gig of ram which means it can run all the animations without chugging too much. This isn't flawless, however, and the watch can occasionally drag.Overall, this is a big watch that is a lot of fun to wear. If you are into the Google ecosystem, then this is a good choice for a Watch OS watch.",
            "This is an incredible watch.  The teenager who is wearing it is still learning to use it and the things he can do with it.  He is related to me and naturally did not read the directions.  He says it's like learning on the run.  He did not have any difficulty connecting to his iPhone XR.  He found all the basic things right away -- the things he was looking for in a smart watch -- activity tracking and heart rate.  He has been able to customize it to do the things he needs it to do.The only difficulty he has is wearing an actual watch.  He never has.  He says he is getting used to it by thinking of it as a little computer on his wrist.  Time is only a small part of it."

            "Keeping the price into account, it's a very fantastic fitness watch. It has got so many fitness that it can measure including walking steps counter, running and much more. It has an app for setting up and different setups to do from the comfort of the phone. Convenient time setup, alarm function, notification alerts, sedentary alert and much more. Don't expect everything a $800 smart watch does, coz it gives much more than the price you pay for.",
            "Excellent watch with so many advanced features in it with user friendly user interface. Easy to wear and with the latest version it's keeping all the data of your health. The wrists are so comfortable to wear with excellent quality.Highly recommended!",
            "This watch is great for my daily steps and sleep pattern and heart rate monitor.I compared it to my expensive one and the steps and monitors are exact :) great watch",
            "You get what you pay for here. You get alerts for email , msg, phone calls ect but you cannot access them via watch and it very quickly flashes alert Two seconds and there gone. Strap is on last hole to fit my wrist so only just fit me. Other wise works ok.",
            "I bought this watch for my wife. She loves it. Feels like high built quality. Fast touch response. Excellent fitness tracking.",
            "Basically the product exceeded the description in every way. The band can be sized to fit an adult or child.",
            "I mean it works but I wouldn't put faith in any of the readings",
            "It works, it is quite basic and worth the money paid.",
            "I love the Apple Watch feel and look of this Smartwatch Smart bracelet! Since receiving the package, I have been wearing it every day and it has been a wonderful experience. With the app on my phone, it is easy to tweak some settings or get familiar with the watch. It is direct and very user friendly. It changes my Spotify music, check my bp,hrm, walking, workout activities. I love how it also notifies me with my phone notifications. There are also alarm, countdown timers and stopwatches. It may not be an Apple Watch but it is still pretty good for what you pay! I am so happy!",
            "What an amazing watch at an unbelievable price, I know the most important thing about these types of watches is the accuracy! I have only been wearing it for a day but the accuracy seems to be spot on, I went to my doctor last week and she took my blood pressure which was 120/80 this watch measured it at 121/81 wow! that is accurate, heart rate too was spot on. The watch is a beautiful design too, why would anyone spend hundreds of dollars on fancy brand names when they can get as much accuracy for $25, beats me!",
            "I have a small wrist and this watch is the size of a very similar looking watch so it's perfect for smaller wrists.Three functions that I need are quite good, being:1. Fitness Tracker2. Call/Sms notifier3. Long battery (I get 8 days)I was actually plesently surprised given its battery size that it lasts over a few days.",
            "Good battery life, built quality is impressive, looks great on the wrist, accuracy is fantastic for different parameters like heart rate, bp and step counter.User interface is quite friendly, android app is pretty useful and connects flawlessly via Bluetooth. Apps notifications compatible.In this price it is definitely a great deal, we wouldn't find a branded simple sport band in this priceHaven't noticed any cons really after using for almost a month",
            "I bought this watch for my husband. He loves it as its connected easily on his smart phone. Easy to use and its good for its price. RecommendEd it to someone need a smart watch for a good price.",
            "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a0Gift for hubby.  He loved that he can read message on it and check phone calls on it. One charge can pretty much last for four days.  Considering the price.  I would say it's a good  buy.",
            "I have received this smart watch and I am using this on daily basis. Excellent quality and good battery life. It comes with charging wire. This smart watch has lots of features like, heart rate, steps, alarm etc. Elegant design value for money. Very quick shipment very next day I received this watch. Thanks",

            "My third Wear OS smart watch and the best one so far. It looks fantastic, the screen size (46mm) is wonderful and sits on my wrist just fine. Not bulky at all. The display is sharp and crisp and quite readable in outdoor conditions. The responsiveness of Wear OS is smooth and quick. No lag or pauses between commands and execution. The OS is skinned by OPPO and is better for it. Just little tweaks here and there that improve it (eg. an app tray for icons rather than a stack of icons to scroll up and down through). The fitness stuff works well and the sleep measuring seems accurate, and I can attest that the watch is comfortable enough to wear through the night. On the subject of comfort, the defacto silicone strap is fine but I did replace it with a nylon one as I prefer this material on my wrist. The watch also does a good job of handling calls. The speaker handles voices well but obviously will be impacted by the sound levels of the environment you make / receive calls in. The only downside at the moment woukd be the limted amount of watch faces available for the device. The ones supplied are adequate and utilise the whole screen, whereas ones in apps like Facer don't because they're either square or round which don't suit the rectangular nature of the OPPO watch's screen. However, there is an update coming to the watch that apparently has an extra fifty faces to choose from, but as of yet my watch hasn't received it so I can't comment on that.All-in-all this is an awesome smart watch and is a fantastic advert for Wear OS and wearable tech.",
            "I had a Fossil GEN 5 and my only gripe was hat the crown should have been in a different position. I constantly found myself pressing the the button by mistake all the time. Got to the point where I had to install an app to stop Google voice from working which took away a lot of Google options. Think was mainly due to the fact that my wrists are too big. I gave it to a friend and it's fine for him. Is still a great watch but I love oppo and oneplus products.",
            "Pros:Accelerometers good (Heartbeat sensor, steps)Fit apps are ok, but hard to integrate into Android ecosystemLots of watch facesSpeaker/microphoneCons:Convoluted interface - really makes you appreciate the Apple watchDisplay adaptability (light)Lack of CustomisabilityNotifications not greatSleep tracking doesn't work with Google fitI switched to this because I switched from iPhone to Find X2 Pro. The X2 is far superior to the iPhone. The Oppo Smartwatch is not even close.",
            "The watch did what it's made to do. I just personally didn't like how bulky it was... But that issue is more about me than the watch.",
            "I bought this watch to replace a broken Fitbit and I am 100% satisfied.",
            "I have an Oppo phone and this is the perfect complement for it. Does everything a smartwatch is supposed to do and has been trouble-free from the start. Works well to help you create and stick to an exercise program. Be sure to add the Wear OS and HeyTap Health apps (both free) to get maximum value.",
            "Value for money, Brilliant Display,very good performance, I really satisfied.",
            "Love the product and features but battery is something disappointed..but it's ok ....",
            "Awesome smart watch with WearOs!!As like all other reviews and feedbacks here, the battery life lasted for almost 2hrs only for the first time use. And the user interface was very laggy too.But, after completed two recharging cycles [approx. 2x(20% to 100 %)] I got more than 24 hr battery life without any power saving mode (with Tilt to wake ON, automatic brightness ON, notification like call, message etc. from phone ON, Continuous Heart Rate sensor ON). And the user interface is also very very smooth now.Tips for battery life:-1. Turn OFF Location services when you are not using maps or any workout modes.2. Only use wifi while charging your watch. ( Actually No need to use wifi, because internet can be accessible on watch through the phone's bluetooth, if phone's internet connection is ON. No need to enable any options like hotspot sharing, tethering etc.)3. Turn OFF these settings on WearOs app on phone \"Advanced Settings->Watch app data usage\" turn of both sync options. ( If you want do it while charging only)4. Disable any unused gestures.5. Disable all notification sync from Unused apps. Only enable sync notification from messaging apps on phone. And mute all messy telegram group messages on phone.Pros:-1. Huge number of watche faces are available.2. Lot of wearos apps support on playstore3. Ability to  install apks (If you know how to use adb and fastboot on windows or mac)4. All the sensors are accurate. I checked the step counter also. It will never count any false steps while driving, motor bike riding etc.5. Stability of connection with phone.6. Very very very Fast Charging.7. Ability to connect Bluetooth headset.8. Google assistantCons:-1. Watch has NFC. But currently there is no Google pay support in India (09-oct-2020).2. WearOs Optimisations are good in this watch. But Need improvements.3. Battery life is good as compared to apple watch. But it'll be very good, if it has more battery life.",
            "So I usually do reviews for games so this is new to me overall but I'm going to pinpoint my views entirely over this watch.Good points.This watch has so many amazing features from being able to seemlessly able to track my daily exercise routines to even my sleeping which has helped me try and improve a more balanced sleep schedule with possible workout routines and even telling me when I should get up and move about which I usually take for granted but this has pushed me to try and move more than be stable consistently, I would also like to add the capability of awnsering calls and messages is very accurate being scottish I typically have a hard time voice commands understanding what I say and it seems to honestly understand me fully when sending sms or WhatsApp messages through the vocal command so it's fantastic in those areas, I would also like to add the awensering calls through my watch and using my WiFi earphones works perfectly together alongside the added feature of using Spotify on my watch also.If I was to change anything and that's if I've maybe not stumbled across it yet would be to allow for more customisation to adding tiles to the right swipe section or even the left side to allow for apps such as Spotify Google pay etc to be more easy acessable with the swipe of a finger, also the Google pay feature is a god send it completely takes away the fact I need to hold a wallet now unless I'm purposely wanting cash in my pocket!I would also say the battery life of this watch is pretty awesome its charging process time and it's ability to not die for literal over 48 hrs is awesome and the crispness of the led screen is insane for someone who wears contacts or glasses I used to stray away from smart watches for being so small in texts but the oppo watch 46mm has the perfect size and ratio for someone who isn't 20/20 vision.Overall all this watch is perfect for a techy or sports like or ease of access type of people and I'd give this watch a 10/10 and I'm really looking forward to see where this brand goes in the future so thanks for the purchase and also allowing me to get the watch for the 249 rather than the 279 I was pleasantly suprised!",
            "chunky for.no reason. inspite of that, battery life is absolutely nonsense. even when dont use GPS, i need to charge everynight.there are better devices with superb functions available for less. Thanks Oppo for making a device which is uselss. i like oppo fones but a watch is....",
            "There still some bugs, like I can't do any call using my bluetooth headphones when the watch is connected, but I still love it",
            "I understand many people have given bad battery life review for this watch. However, it is exceptes that the battery life won't last long if you make continuous phone calls or listen to music and Everything.However, I have been using this for a few days now and I didn't find any issue. The Watch charges real fast.- According to my usage, it lasts more than 30 hours with all the features turned on which is good for a watch.- I do exercise using this Watch which has a feature of 5 mins workout with videos and sounds.- I also pickup calls and answer them using the watch.- reply to texts and everything.- then at night I put the device to power saver mode when I don't use it. (This was I am able to keep the charge for around 30hrs)- So if you use it wisely and not think of it as a smartphone, you will be satisfied with the product.The only drawback is that this watch doesnot have spo2.",

Se invece ne fate un uso professionale \u00e8 un ottimo strumento di lavoro. Deve essere ben settato e la batteria dura anche 36 ore.",
            "Great product. Only one thing. The chip is old and doesn't get last wear os update... that's shame :(",
            "I like it. Perfect style. Wow! A true smart watch.The calling and messaging feature is the most important for me and the watch is doing the perfect job. No lagging.Battery runs for a day but I am happy with fast charging. I stopped the Continuous heart monitoring which drain the battery faster. Using for more than 20 days.",
            "Great watch but heeds better battery life.",
            "Value for money and I would like to give a tip regarding battery, wifi will be on always switch off it and use when needed. Charge when it comes to 20 percent always u will see good battery life. For me it comes around 16 hrs. Very happy.",
            "Oggetto a mio parere assolutamente inutile (a questo prezzo): le chiamate via Bluetooth non sono disponibili... Per avere la musica senza collegarlo ad un telefono bisogna scaricare app di gestione file (spotify non consente di scaricare brani mentre youtube music che risolverebbe alla grande la questione non \u00e8 nemmeno disponibile). quindi si risolve in un bellissimo dispositivo (qualit\u00e0 di materiali, assemblaggio e design eccellenti) che permette di fare qualche allenamento (a patto che non vi servano molti dettagli) traccia la frequenza cardiaca, monitora il sonno e riceve notifiche ma nulla pi\u00f9. A questo punto meglio optare per una qualsiasi smartband a 1/10 (o poco pi\u00f9) del prezzo. Ho preferito restituirlo immediatamente.",
            "I\u2019m a pure Apple lover and I was using Apple Watch series 3 from past 3 years, but this time Oppo nailed it,I\u2019m using this watch for 3 days now and Oppo watch performed better than Apple Watch series 3,I received Jan 2021 manufactured model, and I think oppo listed to customer feedback and improve watch performance.Battery is amazing, but in factory settings it consumed full within 6hrs, so after some tweaks and settings now in 100% charge watch can be used for 2 days exact without using power saver.Best thing is ECG mode which was not available before but now with a new software update it\u2019s available.Apple iPhone connectivity is perfect, only calling feature is not available with it but I resolved that issue as well, download google duo app and allow all Permissions, then you\u2019ll receive all calls on watch, but truly speaking I never user calling feature on Apple Watch, and I don\u2019t want calling on Oppo watch too.",
            "This is the best wearos smartwatch at this price range with great display, battery life depends on individual use, for me it last one full day with always-on display.",
            "Works as expected,  looks premium has a good battery backup. If always display is turned off battery backup really is great. Plus wear OS doesn't lag at all has smooth animation, feels like normal watch on the wrist.",

Voir les notifications et pouvoir y r\u00e9pondre directement depuis la montre est une excellente chose. On peut r\u00e9pondre au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec cette montre. Vous pouvez t\u00e9l\u00e9charger des applications vu qu'elle utilise Wear Os (Google) et les finitions sont excellentes ! J'adore cette montre ! Le seul point n\u00e9gatif que je peux donner c'est d'avoir la puce 3100 qui n'est pas la derni\u00e8re (4100) et l'autonomie qui fait qu'il faut la charger tous les jours voir tous les 2 jours (c'est normal car il y a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de fonctionnalit\u00e9s) Sur les autres montres connect\u00e9es qui tiennent plusieurs jours c'est qu'il y a beaucoup moins de fonctionnalit\u00e9s... Pour information l'ECG n'est pas disponible sur cette montre",
            "Excellent! If you have an android phone, this is a no brainer! The UI is very similar experience fluid like oxygen is! Changing my life one day at a time. There's nothing you will need on a smart watch that you won't find solved with this watch! Great great value for money!A big plus is some great snappy features like being able to reply to messages fast, reading important news, stock updates and even saving time finding your phone with a click! Everything has worked just right!",

Un parere tecnico: dimezzate la durata da500 a,250 millisecondi,  raddoppiando la potenza. Cos\u00ec non cambia il consumo. Potete,  entro 30 giorni?",
            "Heighly recommended ! The only negative is the battery which lasts for 12-15 hrs when continuously connected with phone and 24 hrs otherwise. This watch is magnificent !!...Luxury packed up with very good features it stands in a neck to neck competition with an Apple Watch at price much lower. If you're not down with Apple Mania better buy an oppo watch without any second thoughts.",
            "I have oppo watch 46mm. I have heard battery complainants but maybe thats for 42mm because that has smaller batter. This one is really good on battery backup. At night i have 40% battery. Thats good as compared to apple. Also the smoothness is wonderful. Wear os is good and keeps track always. There is only one thing when i wear this watch people tell me what apple series watch i am wearing and then i have to tell them its oppo not apple. It looks copy of apple. But i like it in a way because it's best for android and i don't mind an apple design. People still admire this watch.",

I love this display more than apple watchThe sound is good, Mics is also goodPlay store is a pretty functionsleep tracking is amazingconnectivity is amazingwatch faces are great after you update the software.The battery is decent. if you keep power-saving mode its fabulousif not then maybe 2 days with sleep tracking on.with continuous heart rate maybe aproxx 6-7 hoursbut the charger is amazingly fastDon;t wanna waste time. Everything you expect for a watch to do.The thing I don't like is there aren't many 3rd party straps for this watch.It doesn't;t have SPO2 nor ECG At least I couldn't find ituntil you are in India gpay is not available on the play store but this support NFC it becomes available that is gonna be helpful",
            "Aggiornamento 10/07Oppo dice che G-Assistant c'\u00e8 ma non \u00e8 attivo causa Google, Amazon dice che deve dirlo Oppo.Certo che c'\u00e8 G-Assistant grazie ma non \u00e8 attivo e va detto come nelle versioni Rumene o Tedesche di samsung c'\u00e8 samsung Pay nova in Italia e nulla non lo si dice e per chi non sa che Wear OS ha tolto la funzione lo compra.ERGO NON HA G-ASSISTANT per uno smartwatch \u00e8 importante tanto vale usar il telefono.Mi spiace dar una stella ma Oppo, partiamo male perch\u00e9? Non c'\u00e8 scritto da nessuna parte che \u00e8 privo di assistente vocale, cio\u00e8 \u00e8 un Wear OS e? E non ha G-Assistant cosa un uno smartwatch fondamentale perch\u00e9 se no a sto punto prendo il telefono ogni volta che devo iniziare una conversazione vocale o scritta...Penso che sia corretto da parte di Oppo ed Amazon poi nella descrizione scrivere \"No G-Assistant\". Oppo dice che \u00e8 una questione di aggiornamento ma se ha scelto Wear OS su uno smartwatch a parer mio il pi\u00f9 bello per ora del mercato beh... Pare assurdo che non vada proprio l'assistente vocale.In pi\u00f9 il cinturino \u00e8 proprietario sul sito di Oppo ci son tanti bei conturini colorati ma...

Quando si usa con vocale da messaggi o risposte notifiche (senza Ok Google che non c'\u00e8) adesso esce la scritta \"inizializzazione\" fa aspettare \u00e8 lento nello scrivere e con la grafica nuova hanno peggiorato fortemente l'unica cosa decente di Google la tastiera.Io non so se lo fanno apposta davvero, non l'ho pi\u00f9 reso ma adesso sinceramente diventa non facile interagire per uno smartwatch davvero bello uno dei migliori in estetica e qualit\u00e0 ma...Non supportato per assurdo da chi lo fa e il servizio clienti Oppo se pur gentili non sanno che dire.",
            "El reloj tiene un dise\u00f1o muy bonito, parecido al Apple watch en muchas cosas. En mi caso es el de 46mm y para m\u00ed, mido 187cms, no se ve grande aunque en la foto lo pueda parecer. El funcionamiento es muy bueno y fluido, aunque pueda resultar raro tener 2 Apps para algunas funcionalidades si quieres mantener las de Google. Las 4 estrellas vienen por la bater\u00eda, sab\u00eda que el reloj, lo m\u00e1ximo que daba eran unas 40 horas, sin embargo, y desconozco el motivo, algunos d\u00edas, incluso con poco uso no llega a las 24 horas. Por suerte, el cargador es muy r\u00e1pido y carga bastante bater\u00eda, aunque si quieres sacarle la m\u00e1xima duraci\u00f3n debes dejarlo un buen rato",
            "Cosa si pu\u00f2 dire, una goduria per gli occhi. Orologio di qualit\u00e0 premium alla pari, forse superiore, ad altri nella stessa fascia.",
            "Premesso che di per se l'orologio \u00e8 molto bello, elegante (sicuramente con cinturino adatto, che, aim\u00e8, scarseggiano e si trovano solo dalla cina), il sistema \u00e8 stata una delusione assoluta dal primo giorno di utilizzo. Il problema di per se non \u00e8 Oppo (anche se, da quello che ho capito, avendo un processore gi\u00e0 vecchio non verr\u00e0 aggiornato a Wear OS 3.0), ma il sistema operativo.A parte il fatto della batteria che non dura nemmeno 2 giorni, ma questo di per se non \u00e8 un problema per il fatto della ricarica super rapida, i problemi si fanno vedere con l'utilizzo di google assistant.Non \u00e8 possibile effettuare chiamate tramite l'assistente. Quando ci si prova, lui risponde con un \"non posso pi\u00f9 farlo\", costringendoti quindi a scorrere i contatti o a chiamare direttamente dallo smartphone. Ho scoperto per\u00f2 che anzich\u00e8 il nome del contatto basta dire il numero di telefono e lui magicamente funziona (ma al giorno d'oggi chi \u00e8 che sa a memoria i numeri di telefono?).Altra cosa molto grave, sempre con assistant, \u00e8 l'impossibilit\u00e0 di inviare messaggi, ad esempio con whatsapp, costringendoti per forza a mandarli da smartphone.Senza queste due comodit\u00e0, trovo veramente inutile lo smartwatch e sto pensando seriamente di fare il reso.",
            "Allora sicuramente un ottimo prodotto leggero quasi non si sente al polso sistema operativo ancora un po' acerbo non risponde sempre hai comandi assistente Google io ho il modello da 46 mm e la batteria dura esattamente 15 ore utilizzando WhatsApp telegram chiamate messaggi identico a Apple watch soddisfatto dell'acquisto dimenticavo WhatsApp si ricevono le notifiche si pu\u00f2 rispondere ma le foto non sempre vengono visualizzate tant'\u00e8 ti ho installato un'applicazione informer e grazie a questa si riescono a vedere le foto sentire l'audio rispondere alle chiamate direttamente  dall'orologio",
            "Great watch but not that great OS. For all users who are thinking why Google assistant isn't properly working is that the watch only has English US and English UK and you have to set the same on phone to give commands and make calls as the phone is so connected with the phone. I found this flaw by myself, no article has this solution as this is so disappointing that English India isn't there in the watch and only Hindi is there for India (mentioned as bharat). Due to all this I even replaced the watch once and tried harder to find a fix for this which I was successful in with the replacement one.Google assistant \"Okay Google\" doesn't work even if enabled and with all permissions enabled, etc. Only long press to enable it works but glad it works and can make calls is what I wanted rather than using screen to dial or locate contact.Other stuff are great, though wanted more watch faces from the company.",
            "Tener cuidado al comprarlo, no es la versi\u00f3n LTE es solo WiFi aunque no lo especifique y cambia de precio constantemente. El reloj en s\u00ed my bien el problema aqu\u00ed es el vendedor y la descripci\u00f3n del producto.",
            "Non sono mai stato un fanatico di orologi, da quando ci sono gli smartphone non li ho pi\u00f9 messi perch\u00e9 l'ora la vedevo l\u00ec. Ancora pi\u00f9 titubante ero per gli smartwatch perch\u00e9 ero consapevole della durata limitata delle batterie. Poi mi hanno regalato questo orologio e non me lo sono pi\u00f9 tolto se non per ricaricarlo. Lo trovo bello, leggero e utile. In particolare mi permette di rispondere alle notifiche e alle chiamate, di porre domande vocali all'assistente Google, controllare la musica al telefono  e ovviamente di monitorare sport e sonno.Peccato gli manchino i sensori per l'ossigenazione del sangue (manca anche l'elettrocardiogramma ma credo che sia una buffonata metterlo sugli orologi...); la batteria mi dura pi\u00f9 di un giorno e si carica abbastanza velocemente (circa 45'). L'attacco dei cinturini all'orologio \u00e8 molto pratico, molto meno la chiusura al polso, ancora non ci riesco, sar\u00f2 impedito.

            "An sich ist die Uhr gut, mal davon abgesehen dass ich unbedingt eine gelbgoldene Smartwatch wollte und durch die Produktbilder dachte, dass es sich hierbei um gelbgold handelt. Die Uhr ist definitiv ros\u00e9gold.Grunds\u00e4tzlich ist die Uhr hochwertig verarbeitet und gibt ein Gutes Gef\u00fchl. Leider gibt es aber auch ein paar Mankos. Zum einen, und das ist das Wichtigste, war die Schrittz\u00e4hlung \u00fcberhaupt nicht richtig. Es waren immer nur 50% von dem was mir andere Fitnesstracker angezeigt haben. Desweiteren gibt es nur ca. 5 Sportmodi (Laufen, Fahrradfahren, sowas). Man hat die M\u00f6glichkeit \u00fcber die Google Fit App auf der Uhr das Training zu tracken (wo es wesentlich mehr Auswahl gibt), dieses synchronisiert sich dann aber nicht mit der Oppo eigenen App f\u00fcrs Smartphone.Ferner kann man f\u00fcr die Schlafenszeit keine Ber\u00fchrungssperre einrichten (wie bspw. Beim Mi Fit Band).Was ich richtig toll fand ist Google Maps auf der Uhr. Wenn man mal mit dem Fahrrad oder Roller unterwegs ist, kann man kurz auf die Uhr schauen um die Route zu verfolgen. Allerdings aktiviert sich das bei jeder Route automatisch auf der Uhr. Im Auto unn\u00f6tiger Akkuverbrauch. Vielleicht kann man das abstellen, habe nur nicht herausgefunden, wie.Am Ende ging die Uhr zur\u00fcck. Auch der Preis ist verglichen mit High Performer Smartwatches (zB Galaxy Watch 4) ziemlich hoch daf\u00fcr dass soviele Funktionen fehlen.",
            "L'orologio \u00e8 gradevole e cerca di imitare Apple watch in tutto.L'unica cosa su cui non potr\u00e0 mai riuscirci , e questo non \u00e8 colpa di Oppo, \u00e8 il sistema operativo.Android Wear \u00e8 limitato, poco sviluppato e poco supportato.La quantit\u00e0 di app \u00e8 imbarazzante : da questo punto di vista chi sposa Android \u00e8 fortemente in svantaggio perch\u00e9 credo che al momento , forse un p\u00f2 i Garmin, nessuno raggiunge la qualit\u00e0 di Apple Watch che si , \u00e8 eccessivamente costoso (a quel prezzo io comprerei un orologio tradizionale che sicuramente nel tempo pu\u00f2 solo aumentare di valore) ma \u00e8 pi\u00fa avanti. L'assistente vocale poi non regge il confronto con Siri : ancora non hanno risolto dei bug basilari come il poter richiamare un nome dalla rubrica che \u00e8 la cosa pi\u00fa basilare che uno smartwatch deve avere",
            "Von der Hardware her ist die Oppo Watch richtig gut, aber was nutzt es, wenn Oppo es nicht hinbekommt eine vern\u00fcnftige Software zu entwickeln!! Egal welches Smartphone mit Android ich benutzt habe, es erfolgte keine Kopplung \u00fcber die Oppo App \"Heytap\". Und ohne diese ist die Watch fast unbrauchbar. Wear OS zeigt dadurch kaum relevante Daten an und auch der Sprachassistent von Google ist damit wertlos. F\u00fcr den Preis hole ich mir doch lieber eine Apple Watch 3. Oppo sollte dringend seine Smartphone App \u00fcberarbeiten und die Akkulaufzeiten (miserabel) verbessern. Fazit von mir: \"Die Watch geht zur\u00fcck nach Amazon\".",
            "Oppo Watch 46mmEs ist erstaunlich, wie einfach man heute Dinge als das Nonplusultra verkaufen kann. Das hat aber vermutlich mit der Gier zu tun, immer etwas Neues haben zu m\u00fcssen.Da meine Smartwatch-Sammlung langsam in die Jahre gekommen ist dachte ich, es sei einmal an der Zeit f\u00fcr einen Neuzugang. Die vielf\u00e4ltigen Lobeshymnen auf die Oppo Watch machten die Entscheidung recht einfach: Sie sei die Apple Watch f\u00fcr Android etc.Zugegebenerweise machte sie beim Eintreffen eine gute Figur. Besonders die hochwertige Verarbeitung und die Auswahl der Materialien hierf\u00fcr beeindruckten. Besonderes Highlight ist das gew\u00f6lbte Display. Eine weitere Auff\u00e4lligkeit war das anders als \u00fcblich montierte Armband. W\u00e4hrend sich bei allen zweiteiligen Armb\u00e4nden das Teil mit der Schlie\u00dfe oben befindet, ist es hier an der Unterseite montiert. Diesen Umstand habe ich sofort ge\u00e4ndert, was mit der einfachen Montageeinrichtung ein leichtes Spiel war. Trotzdem ist das Armband der erste herbe Kritikpunkt an der Uhr. Das Anlegen ist strapazi\u00f6s, welches der offenbar viel zu weit gestalteten Schlaufe, in der man das Band nach dem Anlegen fixiert, geschuldet ist. Diese Schlaufe rutscht stets nach unten und verhindert somit das Einf\u00fchren des gew\u00fcnschten Loches im Armband in den daf\u00fcr vorgesehenen Dorn. Man kann die Uhr praktisch nur Anlegen, wenn man eine sitzende Position einnimmt, die eigentliche Uhr auf dem Knie ablegt, um somit die Dornschlie\u00dfe einigerma\u00dfen sicher schlie\u00dfen zu k\u00f6nnen. Das ist nicht erfreulich, schon gar nicht in diesem Preisniveau!Die an verschiedener Stelle ger\u00fcgte Anzahl an Watch Faces ist ebenfalls berechtigt. Es gibt h\u00f6chstens zwei oder drei, die wirklich ansprechend sind, alles andere ist Kinderei. Hinzu kommt, dass viele auch noch mit technischen Fehlern behaftet sind. Bei einer aktualisiert sich die Au\u00dfentemperatur nicht von selbst sondern erst, wenn man das Wetter-Tile manuell aufgerufen hat (!!!), ein anderes aktualisiert nicht einmal die Uhrzeit im Allways On Display, sondern bleibt st\u00e4ndig auf dem zuletzt aufgerufenen Wert stehen. F\u00fcrwahr: Die ideale Arbeitgeber Uhr! \u00dcber diese Dinge k\u00f6nnte man ja noch lachen und w\u00fcrde sie einer \u20ac19,99 Uhr auch sicherlich zubilligen!Geradezu bedenklich stimmt mich, dass die Uhr pl\u00f6tzlich und ohne ersichtlichen Grund 10 Minuten vor ging! Auch ein Neustart hat hier nichts bewirkt, aber ebenso urpl\u00f6tzlich ging sie dann auch wieder richtig. Einen solchen Schnitzer kann sie sich nat\u00fcrlich nicht \u00f6fters leisten bzw. sie ist jetzt schon in Anbetracht dieser Umst\u00e4nde auf der Arbeit absolut unbrauchbar!Fazit: Die Oppo watch ist ein wunderbares Beispiel f\u00fcr den Generationen-Konflikt, der leider immer \u00f6fter zu beobachten ist. Die jungen Generationen streben nach immer mehr  Leistung und lassen dabei das wichtige und wesentliche str\u00e4flich vernachl\u00e4ssigt zur\u00fcck. So d\u00fcrfte meine Oppo watch ihren Platz in der Vitrine gefunden haben, ohne jemals richtig zum Einsatz gekommen zu sein. Schade eigentlich.",
            "One word, GO FOR IT.My main specific Purpose to buy this watch is,1. Check and receive calls on watch  [\u2714]2. Always-on display to check the time  [\u2714]3. Google Maps  [\u2714]4. Best Display  [\u2714]5. Smooth UI  [\u2714]all above reasons are fulfilled, so no special complaint.It's the best watch I have got, to date. I wish I would have bought it earlier.Just by reading, review, I was thinking about battery life is low and all. I would rather say, it is an Android Wear OS watch, you can expect 1-day battery life and I am ok with it.My setting with watch includes,1. Always-ON-display --> ON {Big Fan, here}2. Notification for only Gmail, Messaging, Call --> ON3. Recieve Call on watch --> ON4. WiFi, GPS, NFC --> OFF, actually I feel keeping WiFi on doesn't make sense.The best thing about this watch is OPTIMIZATION. It has limited official watch faces, but each watch face has its own version of the Always-ON-display face. On-call, the message also takes advantage of the always-on display.Health Tracking, I didn't explore this side. No comments here.Last word,We have to always make the trade-off with battery life. It totally depends on you and your usage. As it serves my purpose I am happy. Also, you won't find any other watch at this price. I bought it for 16k including offers",

            "Lo sto usando da due giorni, completo la settimana per vedere se ci sono assestamenti, ma penso proprio che far\u00f2 il reso e spiego il perch\u00e9:1- la batteria... Ok lo sto usando da due giorni, il primo giorno ricaricato 2 volte e mezzo (era al 50% quando \u00e8 arrivato), ricevendo anche un messaggio di errore sulla ricarica rapida per temperatura alta. Il secondo giorno, staccato alle 8 di mattina \u00e8 arrivato alle 7 di sera con uso non intenso. Ma aspetto appunto altri due giorni per capire se la batteria si assesta.2: In questi giorni di caldo purtroppo ho dovuto togliere l'orologio perch\u00e9 si \u00e8 scaldato troppo e mi ha dato molto fastidio al polso.3- volume troppo basso, le chiamate si sentono solo se c'\u00e8 silenzio, al minimo rumore diventa inudibile.Questi sono i tre motivi principali... Aggiungo che personalmente non lo trovo cos\u00ec bello come raccontano dal punto di vista del design, il software \u00e8 abbastanza scarno e nonostante sia wear Os non posso avviare una chiamata con l'assistente vocale mi risponde \"mi dispiace non posso pi\u00f9 farlo\" oltre al fatto che il comando OK GOOGLE funziona 1 volta su 5, e diversi comandi non funzionano come si smartphone...male, malissimo in questo senso, perde tutto il vantaggio nei confronti di Tizen. Le app nello store sono poche e la maggior parte sono a pagamento e sono anche care.La luminosit\u00e0 automatica \u00e8 troppo conservativa, all'esterno si \u00e8 costretti a regolare manualmente la luminosit\u00e0 massima.Unica nota positiva \u00e8 che il touch risponde bene e l'orologio \u00e8 sempre reattivo.Rimandato per altri 4 giorni, poi aggiorno la recensione e decider\u00f2 se renderlo.

            "awesome band for the price! has a bunch of unexpected features and a great vibrate for notifications when phone is silent.the band tends to come undone rather easily so its best to have a small rubber band or similar over the strap. Also, sometimes the HR monitor will inaccurately alert you of a high HR, usually because the band isn't sitting flat and firm above the bone of your wrist. The menus scroll smoothly and have plenty of options.  The band is probably let down by the app, which seems to need regular syncing to keep things in check.  there are hundreds of watch face display options in the app.the magnetic charger and band itself feel very well built. I have all the features running and HR every 5 minutes or so and battery lasts 4-6 days easily",
            "I recently dropped my Band 5 and cracked the screen , picked up the Band 5 as a replacement.It cost a little more than the 5 but still offers excellent value compared to other fitness trackers. Bigger screen and more functions set it apart from the Band 5. The pulse and blood oxygen readings are accurate provided you wear it quite tight (but that\u2019s the same for any other)Only downside is the app which isn\u2019t the most intuitive and takes a little getting used to.",

Il GPS \u00e8 di una precisione impressionante e prende il segnale in pochissimi secondi. Peso davvero ridotto e al polso non si sente, nonostante le dimensioni importanti.Belo da vede e con molti quadranti tra i quali scegliere.La carica ...forse una piccola pecca, dura facendo attivit\u00e0 ogni giorno e tracciandola con GPS 4gg max 5.Riceve le notifiche ma non potete rispondere.Il linea generale pi\u00f9 che soddisfacente \u00e8 lo consiglio nel modo pi\u00f9 assoluto.",

            "Despu\u00e9s de 5 meses de uso, puedo decir que el reloj est\u00e1 bastante bien pero le faltan muchos datos para correr:- Marca el tiempo y distancia en vuelta, ritmo/velocidad/ritmo card\u00edaco/cadencia y lo mismo de la \u00faltima vuelta., pero solo con vueltas manuales (d\u00e1ndole al bot\u00f3n \"back\"). Esto est\u00e1 bien cuando das vueltas a un circuito. Pero no pone los datos del km, ni del \u00faltimo km u otro intervalo, lo \u00fanico que pone es el tiempo del \u00faltimo km cada vez que completas uno. Para correr al aire libre es mejor lo segundo.- En el modo de entrenamiento por intervalos no pone el ritmo que llevas en ese intervalo ni casi ning\u00fan dato, solo pone lo que te falta para el siguiente. Tampoco indica cu\u00e1ntas series llevas ni cu\u00e1ntas te faltan para acabar, si son m\u00e1s de 10 tienes que ir llevando la cuenta y se supone para eso llevas el un reloj \"inteligente\".- En el modo de entrenamiento por intervalos puedes elegir las series por distancia, por tiempo o manuales, pero ya que el reloj tiene puls\u00f3metro, estar\u00eda bien que tuviese la opci\u00f3n de intervalo por frecuencia card\u00edaca, por ejemplo: correr hasta llegar a 180 ppm y que te avise, despu\u00e9s bajar a 120 ppm y te avise de nuevo.Aspectos del reloj en s\u00ed:- El GPS no va mal, a veces tarda en coger la se\u00f1al, pero en zonas sin edificios altos dibuja bastante bien el trazado.- Buena duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda, pero lo de los 70 d\u00edas ser\u00e1 si no lo usas. Corriendo 1 hora de media al d\u00eda con GPS y con el modo de medici\u00f3n continua de ritmo card\u00edaco dura 4-5 d\u00edas.- Buena medida de la frecuencia card\u00edaca.- El alt\u00edmetro barom\u00e9trico mide lo que le da la gana. Tampoco se puede pedir precisi\u00f3n ah\u00ed teniendo en cuenta el precio.- Lo de la resistencia al agua ser\u00e1 verdad, no lo he usado para nadar, pero corriendo con mucha lluvia se vuelve loco y se pausa, para la actividad, etc. El t\u00e1ctil se tendr\u00eda que poder desactivar o directamente no ser t\u00e1ctil la pantalla.Otras funciones del reloj:- No tiene aplicaci\u00f3n de escritorio, web o algo as\u00ed, solo la app Zepp, y es bastante limitada.- Puedes usarlo para controlar la m\u00fasica del m\u00f3vil pero no estando en el modo de entrenamiento. Para cambiar de canci\u00f3n sin estar usando el reloj ya lo haces en el m\u00f3vil directamente.- Creo que tampoco se le pueden cargar mapas, pero en este rango de precios eso no existe.",
            "El reloj cumple con lo que promete. El GPS es muy preciso y rapid\u00edsimo. Tiene un mont\u00f3n de funciones deportivas, aunque yo solo he utilizado unas pocas; Correr, Caminar, Nataci\u00f3n y Senderismo.Tiene algunas cosas por mejorar como la aplicaci\u00f3n iOS. Los entrenos por series no se pueden configurar desde el reloj, solo desde la app, y los campos de datos en el reloj son muy escasos. Supongo que est\u00e1s fallas ir\u00e1n mejorando a trav\u00e9s de futuras actualizaciones de firmware.Es un reloj muy recomendable por su relaci\u00f3n calidad/precio, aunque el producto carezca del soporte empresarial de un Garmin/Polar.",

            "Soy ciclista y lo compr\u00e9 para analizar mis salidas. Lo peor: a expensas de confirmar en una futura salida, el ritmo cardiaco lo mide como el culo.... en comparaci\u00f3n con mi anterior Garmin es muy impreciso, subiendo una rampa del 15 % asfixiado me daba 80 ppm....En general todo es un poco al estilo chino; hay textos que no aparecen en espa\u00f1ol, sino en chino u pasan las actualizaciones y sigue en chino.. la app es muy pobre y poco intuitiva, esta mal hecha, la comparas con garmin y simplemente est\u00e1 hecha al estilo chino, como improvisada. Voy a usarlo 1 semana mas para confirmar lo de la frecuencia cardiaca y si sigue fallando lo devolver\u00e9.Puntos positivos: es ligero, tienes la posibilidad de meter un track en pdx y el gps te gu\u00eda (lo he probado u funciona, no es la bomba ni muy exacto, pero funciona: ves el dibujo de la ruta en el tel\u00e9fono y un puntito que eres tu (no te da indicaciones, sirve para ver si sigues o no en el track), el gps parece preciso de momento (tiene varios sat\u00e9lites, glonas incluido)El t\u00e1ctil funciona bienLa bater\u00eda en uso normal dura 4 o 5 d\u00edasLa saturaci\u00f3n en sangre yo no he visto la opci\u00f3n por ninguna parte, que yo sepa no lo mide...El bar\u00f3metro te da los hpp pero no se como se precis\u00f3 esLa latitud creo que tambi\u00e9n falla bastante...En fin, seguir\u00e9 probando e ir\u00e9 diciendo en este chat",

            "I was very impressed with the quick delivery.I wish I could say that I was impressed with the Vivosmart. It does some things superbly but others not so well at all, compared with my old Fitbit Alta.The Vivosmart does a great job of measuring my sleep, heartbeat, pulse rate and stress levels. But it doesn't do anywhere near as well at tracking my exercise. The step count is significantly lower than the Alta and it just doesn't measure when I've been for a walk. It tracks the steps but not the activity. I have no idea why. On one occasion, when I put on a spurt, it tracked about 2 minutes of running. Trust me, I don't run!!I also find the screen difficult to manage. I would have preferred a landscape orientation, as portrait displays the time in two parts, the hours on one line and the minutes on another. At night, though, when it's tracking my VO2 the display changes and it's all on one line and virtually unreadable to my ageing eyes. The menus too are quite hard to manage, as the menu button is so close to the area I'm trying to scroll, and I quite often end up going up a level by mistake.I have to say, though, that it is a very attractive piece.",
            "I wanted to get an activity tracking watch and bought the vivosmart 4 i have had one previously and can't believe all of the extras included. You get sleep tracking, stress, heart rate etc everything you would want. I love the band size as its not as chunky as other watches. I would recommend the rose gold and grey it goes with everything!",
            "1.  Have large wrist and barely fits.  Quite uncomfortable.  Made for thin people not for large ones trying to get thin.2.  Tapping the display is not very responsive.3.  readouts disappear if you are not careful to tap in the right place.4.  I should have bought something simpler.  I'm not into tech in a significant way.",
            "Ok but not as good as an earlier version of the watch. No where near as a responsive touch screen or identification of wrist movement to launch the screen post to view. Smaller size is more discrete. .",
            "I upgraded from a Garmin 3 , for me it is important that I can use it for swimming and water fitness classes . the Garmin graphics on my iphone are great . I am very happy with my purchase . Marie :)",
            "The app works poorly and service is zilch. I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it to others.",
            "I find it needs re-charging every 3-4 days which can be inconvenient if I'm not near my computer",
            "This is my first watch tracker. I love my Garmin. Stylish as well. Great value.",
            "Stopped charging after 3 months  now dead.",

            "Very useful",
            "This is a great product has all the feature I want and looks good. Easy to use",
            "Ive had this item for a few months now, and initially thought it was amazing, loved the app and the graphs you can easily generate. Then I started realizing that it was VERY inaccurate with activities - it usually takes at least 25 minutes of walk/run to get it to detect activity, will only count a couple hundred steps after 45 minutes on a treadmill etc..... Ive tested step counts (walk 250 steps and check what it says) and it is often off by more than 20% (and up to 80%) - registering FEWER steps than taken. It very poorly detects stair climbs, and a staircase in a home usually doesnt register as stairs at all. Ive been up sick in the night multiple times for it to tell me I slept though soundly....I just cant trust the information it gives me at all which is disappointing - the look, comfort, and general function of the device are great. Still on the hunt for a tracker I can have confidence in.",
            "I just received my Garmin Vivosmart 4 in grey with rose gold trim today and so far I love it!  Before I was using the Fitbit Flex device (shown in photo, black band).  By far the Garmin Vivosmart 4 is WAY better!  It reminds me to move every hour and can automatically detect when I'm working out, measures my heart rate, my personal energy battery, stress level and so much more data on the mobile app.  It also reminds me to breathe for mental wellness!The Fitbit app doesn't send me good notifications about low battery, so I often found out too late that I needed to recharge it and lost a lot of valuable data, and it doesn't remind you to move. The Garmin is slightly thinner than the Fitbit Flex and the same width, which I like.  I don't need or want a large Smartwatch.  I already own a regular watch, which I wear on the opposite arm.  To get better stats and insights on Fitbit, you have to pay a subscription for the Premium services.  All these great features on the Garmin are FREE!I don't mind the slight delay when I lift my wrist to check the Garmin when it switches from a dark screen to a lit one to show the time.  It's maybe a half second.  Some other reviewers found that annoying.  It doesn't bother me at all.  It does take a bit of time to learn how to find the menu item you're looking for, such as setting the exercise type.So far it seems to be fairly accurate.  It certainly seems more accurate today than my Fitbit when I did a workout.  The Fitbit seemed to under-report the number of steps, but the Garmin indicated the right amount of steps based on previous step counting of the same workout on previous days.I like that I can quickly check the weather and know the day of the week and date on first glance.Update: After 1 week and using this with cardio workouts, I still really love using this!  The screen can sometimes be unresponsive or with a long delay.  I think this happens when my finger has a bit of oil residue or the screen gets a little dirty.  It's not hard to clean the tiny screen, so it's ok.  I really appreciate the hourly reminders to get up and move, since I am working from home in front of a computer all day.  This helps reduce problems I was having with my neck and shoulders.  I also like the timer features on it, so I can do some quick workouts with each move being say 1 minute, then it buzzes when that minute is up so I can switch to the next move and restart the timer.  I find this easier than using a smart phone and needing to look at the time, picking up and putting down the phone each time the timer ends.  It has a stopwatch feature as well.  You can set a wake up alarm and it buzzes you when it's time to get up.This is the best value for a fitness tracker with so many great features like the pulse oximeter and the heart rate monitor, and so much more!",
            "When I received the watch I was very pleased. My wrists are small, to the appearance was not overpowering. However, after a month I noticed the accuracy of my steps was sometimes incorrect.I purchased the watch because of the rose gold band but recently noticed that fell completely right off when I was wearing it. It was $200 watch for something that only lasted a few months. Extremely disappointed. Should have invested a little more for a Fitbit or Apple Watch that would last longer then a few months.",
            "I got this wearable because I have terrible anxiety and fatigue.I did a lot of reading and chose this specific model (vivosmart 4) for it's body battery feature, stress and heart rate monitors, and because it doesn't automatically acknowledge 'work outs' - since my heart rate shoots up for no reason, this means my watch doesn't think I'm running. Work outs can be selected manually, and the touch screen is responsive.I struggled with setup for a few minutes, (the pairing button didn't originally appear) but I just kept back opening the bluetooth settings and the button appeared! While the watch doesn't stay connected and synced all day long, it's easy to sync it by opening the app. I love the app.I should acknowledge that a few weeks after getting my watch, there was a ransomware attack. While a little concerning and inconvenient, the only noticeable impact was restricted access to the graphs. This wasn't really an issue though, because the Garmin app is SO THOROUGH. The graphs are colorful and easy to read, and provide a LOT of information. I personally prefer the graphs to those of competitor wearables :)I really can't speak highly enough of this watch. You get a LOT for your money.",
            "Je n'est pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 coupler la montre avec mon t\u00e9l\u00e9phone intelligent. Il me donnait  toujours un nouveau  code pour r\u00e9essayer et c'\u00e9tait toujours \u00e9chec.J'ai communiqu\u00e9 avec Garmin.Garmin nous r\u00e9pond seulement en Anglais.J'ai demand\u00e9 qu'il me r\u00e9pondre en fran\u00e7ais.Ce n'\u00e9tait pas possible.Il me disait qu'il me donnait un rabais de $5.00 mais il fallait que je d\u00e9bourse $53.00 quelque chose comme \u00e7a pour avoir le service d'un technicien. Disons que je n'\u00e9tais pas tr\u00e8s contente. J'ai laiss\u00e9 la conversation.Je ne voulait pas d\u00e9bourser pour une montre neuve.Finalement je peux connecter la montre \u00e0 l'ordinateur et tout fonctionne bien.",
            "Je ne comprends pas pourquoi tout le monde se plaint de ce tracker sur internet... Il fonctionne franchement tr\u00e8s bien la tr\u00e8s grande majorit\u00e9 du temps. \u00c0 part qu'il pense que je dors 5 minutes plus tard qu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 (on peut ajuster cette info manuellement) et qu'il faut parfois se reprendre 2 fois pour allumer l'\u00e9cran, je n'ai rien \u00e0 redire. Mesures tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cises. J'adore la fonction de r\u00e9veil matin, celle de body battery et la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d'indicateurs qu'on peut suivre pour les activit\u00e9s physiques. Les messages envoy\u00e9s sont positifs et r\u00e9alistes, \u00e7a donne r\u00e9ellement envie de bouger plus !",
            "I love how pretty it looks. Very sleek and the rose gold makes it just a bit fancier. I find this one to be more accurate than my last Garmin tracker. I don't like how difficult it is to bring up the stats. It stays off until I tap it  several times. It's supposed to sense when I move it to turn on and it doesn't or does it very randomly. The price was decent. It has several options to do things but I haven't tried much as the screen is touchy. Due to it being so sleek this makes it a downfall too. I do like how the messages work and I can actually see what it's saying. That was something I didn't like about my previous Garmin. Overall, I do like it. The best thing is how tough it is. It's been dropped and banged so many times and zero issues. The app is really easy to use and tracks accordingly. Sleep is the only thing that isn't accurately tracked. If I take it off or lay down it assume's I'm sleeping. I can sleep 4 hours and it will say I slept 11.",

            "well I received this watch today, was very excited about setting it up....I am not that versed in computer technology so it took me a while, but I would say, if you know what you're doing, it should be set up in mere moments.....love the colour, it looks very sleek and elegant and this grey band will go with mostly everything I wear.  the app is great, has a lot of features.....I'm excited to wear it to bed tonight, as I have asthma and I will be able to see what my oxygen levels are as I sleep.....Hopefully, I will wear this every day to keep me motivated to continue with my health and wellness plan.I have only rated this as a 3, as I just got it....but I am optimistic those ratings will climb....So, its a couple months since I bought the Garmin.  I do love it.  I don't think I could be without it now.  There are a lot of activities on this garmin watch.  I find it sleek and nice looking.  The app took a while to set up, but once I got it up and running, I have had no problems.  I previously had a fitbit, for over 6 years, however I have to say, I prefer this little Garmin.  The only down side, is it can take a few taps on it, to see the time.  Unlike the fitbit, the face does not continuously show the time.....Otherwise, I'd buy it again, and will recommend it for anyone, even an old timer like myself.....changing rating to a 4",
            "Despu\u00e9s de varios meses de uso me ha gustado. Es sencillo de utilizar y da informaci\u00f3n relevante. La app se me hizo.medio confusa en un principio. Lo uso diario y lo pongo a cargar dos veces por senana. La carga es r\u00e1pida, un par de horas y listo. Lo que me.molesta es que continuamente pierde la conexi\u00f3n con el tel\u00e9fono y hay que enlazarlos. Despu\u00e9s de usar otros m\u00e1s caros (no soy de hacer deporte, solo como estar pendiente de mi salud) este se me hizo mejor opcion.",
            "Lo compre para tener monitoreo de forma f\u00e1cil del pulso y otras funciones que ofrece el reloj como: nivel de estr\u00e9s, nivel de sue\u00f1o etc y la verdad me gust\u00f3 mucho el dise\u00f1o, las letras pens\u00e9 que ser\u00edan chicas pero son de buen tama\u00f1o.

            "Everything I was expecting and more. I love how I can track my stress, sleep, and workouts. It's super light and auto turns on workouts if I'm hiking or walking fast and tracks it. The Garmin app is so insightful and I'm addicted to setting challenges with friends. Most importantly it's getting me moving more, which was the purpose.",
            "The Good:Nice, slim bracelet design for those who don't want a huge watch. Garmin app for iOS is very well designed, with info layout better than Apple's built-in Health app.The Not-Good:When the Garmin is asleep, the display is insensitive to touches/taps/swipes/wrist-rolls and invariably takes several tries before you can wake it up. This is annoying when you want to quickly check your heart rate while walking, let's say. Also, the watch faces are very limited in what info you'd like to have displayed by default.",

Each charge will last roughly 1.5 days WITHOUT exercise. With exercise it barely finishes the day",

            "Inizialmente ero entusiasta delle prospettive di un orologio Suunto basato su Wear OS. Certo, sarebbe stato fornito con tutto il bagaglio della durata della batteria del sistema operativo Wear e altre stranezze del sistema operativo stesso, ma colmate tuttavia da un enorme (e crescente) gap nella gamma Suunto che hanno musica, mappe , app e pagamenti.Non appena ricevuto ho realizzato come questo SUUNTO 7 fosse realizzato in China a differenza di SUUNTO 9 che e' prodotto in Finlandia. Un vero dispiacere vedere questa decisione da casa SUUNTO.Arriva nella solita scatola Suunto.L'orologio e' avvolto attorno ad un cilindro di cartone. Sotto vi e' un documento che ti racconta l'eredit\u00e0 di Suunto nell'avventura. All'interno del cilindro di cartone \u00e8 presente il caricabatterie.Il caricabatterie \u00e8 diverso da qualsiasi altro prodotto Suunto del passato. Include un magnete per mantenere il caricabatterie saldamente collegato all'orologio durante la ricarica.Suunto 7 pesa 67 g a differenza di altri brand come l'Apple Watch Series 5 che pesa 67 g e di Suunto 9 che pesa 81 g.Mi piace molto il peso e la sensazione del Suunto 7.Il miglior motivo per scegliere il Suunto 7 \u00e8 francamente il fantastico quadrante che hanno incluso che mostra le mappe di calore.E' del tutto personalizzabile \u00e8 infatti possibile modificare il livello di zoom in/out, nonch\u00e9 modificare il tipo di mappa di calore (sci alpino, nuoto, corsa, bici e tanti altri).Tramite il GPS lo smartwatch scarica automaticamente le heat maps quando viaggi in una nuova area.Se per qualche motivo le mappe di calore non vi piacciono, e' possibile scaricare molti quadranti Suunto aggiuntivi dall'app Wear OS o caricarli tramite il Play Store sull'orologio.In termini di luminosit\u00e0, lo schermo \u00e8 facilmente leggibile all'interno e all'esterno.\u231a\ufe0f Wear OS:Premendo il pulsante in alto a sinistra si aprir\u00e0 il programma di avvio delle app, consentendoti di avviare le app scaricate (o preinstallate) o di installarne di nuove tramite il Play Store. Ci\u00f2 \u00e8 notevole, poich\u00e9 qui non \u00e8 necessaria alcuna interazione telefonica per sfogliare / installare app.\u26bd\ufe0fSport:Il monitoraggio delle attivita' sportive \u00e8 interamente ospitato all'interno dell'App Suunto dove e' possibile monitorare tra i 60 e gli 80 sports.Oltre all'app, ci sono sia alcuni widget molto utili aggiunti da Suunto come il diario di allenamento o la visualizzazione in modalita' calendario.\ud83c\udfa7 Musica:Un altro motivo per cui acquistare questo smartwatch e' la musica.Suunto 7 supporta due tipi di musica principali:1. Piattaforme di streaming (come Google Music o Spotify)2. Musica caricata manualmente (come MP3 o simili)E' possibile associare delle cuffie bluetooth e lasciare il telefono a casa.Comodo anche il widget dei controlli multimediali che permette di mettere in pausa o cambiare canzone direttamente dall'orologio.\u2764\ufe0f Monitoraggio della frequenza cardiaca:INUTILE, \u00e8 impossibile avere la frequenza istantanea. A differenza praticamente di qualsiasi altro orologio che ho testato negli ultimi anni, il Suunto 7 \u00e8 completamente inutile per il monitoraggio della frequenza cardiaca 24h/7. Con il campionamento solo ogni 15 minuti (se tutto va bene), \u00e8 difficile estrarre eventuali tendenze significative, oltretutto i dati vengono visualizzati solo all'interno della povera app Google Fit e non della piattaforma di Suunto. Questo e' un grosso punto a sfavore.\ud83d\udce1 GPS:Dal punto di vista della precisione del GPS ho trovato il Suunto 7 abbastanza al passo degli altri smartwatch, non \u00e8 certo un Suunto Ambit, ma sembra buono quanto un Suunto 3/5/9 dal punto di vista GPS per i luoghi e le aree che ho testato.Pecca molto grande qui \u00e8 l'impossibilit\u00e0 di caricare percorsi/itinerari personalizzati (o gpx).\ud83d\udd0b Batteria:ASSOLUTAMENTE NO, ho monitorato attentamente la durata della mia batteria ogni giorno con il Suunto 7 e sono emerse diverse criticit\u00e0.Le prime 24 ore dopo averlo impostato sono un inferno, la batteria si scarica molto velocemente. Migliora leggermente dopo qualche giorno dove in generale, otterrai circa 20-28 ore di autonomia della batteria in standby se utilizzi le impostazioni predefinite su Suunto 7, con un tipico allenamento di 1 ora al giorno. Solo in modalita' standby con notifiche attive si riesce a raggiungere 36 ore di utilizzo (circa 1 giorno e mezzo).I tempi di ricarica sono abbastanza rapidi, circa 90 minuti per una carica completa da 0 a 100.\ud83d\udcb0 Prezzo:Sicuramente non e' un prodotto alla portata di tutte le tasche e 499 euro e' un prezzo leggermente sproporzionato rispetto a quello che il prodotto offre.300 euro sarebbe stato un giusto compromesso (personalmente acquistato a 392 euro in offerta).Non lo ricomprerei, piuttosto andrei sul Suunto 9.Facendo una piccola comparazione con gli altri prodotti Suunto:Suunto 3 (199 euro): orologio di base senza GPS per il rilevamento delle attivit\u00e0;Suunto 5 (329 euro): fa quasi tutto GPS senza un altimetro barometricoSuunto 7 (499 euro): orologio Wear OS con quasi tutte le funzionalit\u00e0 di Suunto 9 (manca ad esempio il monitoraggio del sonno)Suunto 9 (599 euro)",

Was mache ich bitte mit einer Smartwatch die die Navigation als Hauptfeature hat, ich aber keine eigenen Routen verwenden kann?!Schade, da Bedienung der Map auf der Uhr selbst (also zoom, verschieben, etc), nicht nur \u00fcber den Touchscreen (den es ja bei der Fenix Serie leider noch immer nicht gibt), sondern auch \u00fcber die Tasten, um einiges eing\u00e4ngiger w\u00e4re, als bei Garmin.Unglaublich so etwas in den Verkauf zu bringen, zumal ich den technischen Hintergrund nicht verstehen kann, also heatmaps gehen, importierte Routen nicht -> warum? ...*** UPDATE - Okt.2020 ***Suunto hat nun endlich nachgebessert und das mache ich nun auch mit meiner Bewertung...Seit dem letzten Update, kann man endlich auch eigene Routen auf die Smartwatch \u00fcbertragen, bravo, so h\u00e4tte es gleich sein sollen!Die Akkulaufzeit hat sich auch etwas verbessert, wirklich ber\u00fchmt ist sie aber leider noch immer nicht, das liegt aber wohl eher an Wear OS, als an Suunto selbst.In Summe steigt f\u00fcr mich nun die Bewertung von einem auf drei Sterne, der Vierte ist in Reichweite, mal sehen ob es mit zuk\u00fcnftigen Updates eventl. noch besser wird ...",
            "Sind Sie Taucher, Profi-Sportler oder Bergfex, geh\u00f6ren also zur typischen Klientel von Suunto? Dann rate ich Ihnen sich nach einer anderen Uhr umzusehen. Ebenso sollten Sie eine andere Uhr w\u00e4hlen wenn Sie ihre Gesundheits- und Vitaldaten tracken wollen.  Solllten Sie jedoch auf der Suche nach einer alltagstauglichen Smartwatch sein mit welcher Sie ihr mehrmals die Woche wiederkehrendes Workout tracken und analysieren k\u00f6nnen dann ist die  Suunto 7 durchaus eine \u00fcberlegenswerte und gute Option.Doch der Reihe nach und etwas ausf\u00fchrlicher:ARMBAND:Es ist zwar nicht ungew\u00f6hnlich dem Armband bei einer Uhrenrezension einen eigenen Punkt zu widmen, mit diesem Punkt zu beginnen jedoch schon. Dennoch m\u00f6chte ich diese Rezension mit dem Punkt Armband beginnen. Ganz einfach deshalb weil ich die Version mit 2 Armb\u00e4ndern gew\u00e4hlt habe, n\u00e4mlich mit einem grauen Silikonarmband und einem grauen Mikrofasertextilarmband. Und ja, das Textilarmband sieht durchaus stylisch aus und verleiht der Suunto 7 einen nobleren Touch, welcher nicht ganz so nach Sportuhr aussieht, was zu manchen Anl\u00e4ssen durchaus  praktisch ist. Was letztendenlich auch der Grund war, weshalb ich mich f\u00fcr diese Variante entschieden habe, zummal ich eine F\u00fchrungsposition bekleide. Dennoch habe ich das vormontierte Textilarmband relativ schnell durch das Silikonarmband ausgetrauscht, was dank heute eigentlich \u00fcblichen Schnellwechselmechanismus schnell, problemlos und ohne Werkzeug von Statten geht.Ganz einfach deshalb weil das sich Textilaarmband zumindest nicht f\u00fcr schwei\u00dftreibende Workouts eignet da es aufgrund mangelnder Beschichtung an der Innenseite ziemlich schnell ziemlich unansehlich w\u00fcrde. Zudem ist das  Material des Textilarmbandes sehr d\u00fcnn, soda\u00df ich mich des Eindrucks nicht erwehren kann dass es sich zimlich schnell abnutzt und fr\u00fcher oder sp\u00e4ter rei\u00dft. Aufgrund desSehr weichen aber rauen Materials ist es weiterhin auch ein Geduldsspiel die eine Armbandseite beim Anlegen der Uhr durch die Lachen zur Fixierung zu buxieren.Das Silikonarmband hingegen ist \u00e4usserst robust und pflegeleicht und gibt auch sonst keinerlei Anlass zur Kritik, ist allerdings zumindest f\u00fcr Opernbesuche oder festliche Anl\u00e4sse nicht erste Wahl.AKKU:Der Akku ist bei allen Smart- und Sportwatches die Achilllesferse, und nein auch die Suunto 7 macht hier keine Au\u00dfnahme. Wobei das nur die halbe Wahrheit ist, zumindest f\u00fcr eine Wear OS Smartwatch mit GPS hat die Suunto 7 ein sehr sehr hohes Durchhalteverm\u00f6gen. Konkret hei\u00dft das, dass die Suunto 7 nach einem 16 Stundentag, mit 2 Workouts von jeweils ca. 60 Minuten inklusive Tracking und GPS \u00fcber die Suunto App, diversen Notificationen, 6 Timernutzungen, 3 Atem\u00fcbungen und ansonsten der \u00fcblichen Displaykonfiguration noch 32% Akkuladung hatte. Was mehr als respektabel ist jedoch dazu f\u00fchrt, dass man die Suunto 7 bei normaler Nutzung wohl einmal am Tag geladen werden muss. Allerdings dauert der Ladevorgang 32% auf 100% nur etwas mehr als eine gute Stunde. Der  Hersteller gibt f\u00fcr eine Komplettladung einer Dauer von 100 Minuten an, was durchaus glaubhaft erscheint.SOFTWEAR:Dank Wear OS kann die Suunto 7 mit einer nahezu endlosen Anzahl Apps individualisiert und diversen Funktionalit\u00e4ten wie Schlaftracking, Wettervorhersage, Ziffernbl\u00e4ttern (auf der Uhr sind 4 Suunto Ziffernbl\u00e4\u00e4ter, darunter das abgebildte mit den Heatmaps, sowie das Google Fit Ziffernblatt vorinstalliert) ausgestattet werden.Mit der Suunto App k\u00f6nnen wie gewohnt eine Vielzahl (derzeit 70) an Sportarten getrackt werden, wobei im Gegensatz zu den anaderen Suunto-Sportuhren manche Parameter nicht abgebildet werden, welche das ggf sind wir auf der offiziellen Suunto Website en Detail dargestellt. F\u00fcr die \u00fcblichen Sportarten wie Laufen, Gehen, Radfahren und Schwimmen, etc. reicht es nicht nur allemal, sondern es bleiben keinerlei W\u00fcnsche offen.HARDWARE, STEUERUNG und SENSOREN:Die Suunto 7 verf\u00fcgt neben einem NFC-Chip der unteranderme erlaubt per Google-Pay mit der Uhr in vuiuelen Einzeklhandelsgesch\u00e4ften zu zahlen nur noch \u00fcber einen optischen Sensor zur Pulsmessung am Handgelenk, welcher jedoch sehr verl\u00e4ssliche und genaue Ergebnisse liefert. Die messung der zur\u00fcckgelegten H\u00f6henmeter erfolgt jedoch leider nur \u00fcber GPS jedoch nicht \u00fcber einen verbauten Sensor zur H\u00f6henmesssung, somit k\u00f6nnen auch die t\u00e4glich zur\u00fcckgelegten Stockwerke nicht getrackt werden, was f\u00fcr eine moderne und Zeitgem\u00e4\u00dfe Fitness-Uhr eigentlich ein absolutes Must ist.Ein weiteres No-Go f\u00fcr eine Smartwatch in dieser Preisklasse ist auch, dass die Suunto weder \u00fcber Mikrofon nocht Lautsprecher verf\u00fcgt, womit sie sich nicht nur nicht zum telefonieren eignet, was ich pers\u00f6nlich verschmerzen kann. Leider stehen auch f\u00fcr Timer und Wecker keine akkustischen Signale zur Verf\u00fcgung, die entsprechenden Alarme werden also lediglich \u00fcber Vibrationsalarm mitgeteilt, weshalb man die Uhr zu solchen Gelegenheiten auch immer am Handgelenk tragen muss, was zumindest bei der Nutzung als  Wecker etwas l\u00e4stig ist, schlie\u00dflich will die Uhr ja auch geladen werden, wof\u00fcr sich nat\u00fcrlich die Nacht anbietet.Der TOUCHSCREEN reagiert sehr genau und ausreichend aber eben auch nicht zu sensiebel, hier hat Suunto im Gegensatz zuvielen anderen Smartwacht-Herstellern seine Sache wirklich gut gemacht. Lediglich bei Minusgraden kommt es zu teilweisen Reaktionsverz\u00f6gerungen.Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich lassen sich die Grundfunktionen der Suunto 7 nicht nur \u00fcber das Display steuern, sondern auch \u00fcber 4 Physische Tasten, von denen zwei im Grundmodus f\u00fcr den Schnellzugriff frei belegbar sind.Der Touchscreen besteht wie heute eigentlich schon fast State of the Art bei Sportuhren, aus widerstandsf\u00e4higem Gorillaglas.KONNEKTIVIT\u00c4T:Die Bluetooth-Verbindung mit dem Smartphone ist ebenso absolut stabil wie die Verbindung mit dem heimischen WLAN welche sich bei Bedarf automatisch aktiviert um beim Ladevorgang die neuesten Offlinekarten auf die Uhr zu laden oder auch die neuesten Updates. Leider wurde das letzte Update (am gestrigen Tage) jedoch nicht auf die Uhr geladen, als diese auf der Ladestation lag sondern als ich diese am Handgelenk getragen habe, was nicht nur den Akku massiv geschaw\u00e4cht hat, n\u00e4mlich etwa 45 (!)% sondern auch dazu, dass sich das Update wohl auch aufgeh\u00e4ngt hat, weil ich zwischendurch den WLAN-Bereich verlassen hatte und auch mein Smartphone in der TG keinen Empfang hat. Als ich das Problem bemerkt habe, habe ich die Suunto 7 auf der Ladestationgeparkt und das Update erneut manuel heruntergeladen und installiert. Eigentlich kein gro\u00dfes Ding aber dennoch \u00e4rgerlich, nicht nur bei einer Uhr dieser Preisklasse.Und auch bei der Bluetoothverbindung gibt es zumindest in meinem Fall Anlass zur Kritik  f\u00fchrt diese doch zu kurzen Abbr\u00fcchen zwischen meinem Galaxy S10+ und meinen geliebten Libratone TRACK Air+ Earbuds. Jedoch hat die Suunto 7 weder auf die Verbindung zwischen Smartphone und meinen JBL-Sportbuds noch auf die Verbindung mit meinen B&O H9 Overears einen negativen Einfluss, soda\u00df ich dies nur der Vollst\u00e4ndigkeithalber erw\u00e4hnen m\u00f6chte.FAZIT:Ja, ich habe in dieser Rezension einige Kritikpunkte an der Suunto 7 erw\u00e4hnt, jedoch sind die vergebenen 4 Sterne dennoch gerechtfertigt, ganz einfach deshalb weil es auch an anderen Smart- und Sportwatches (Ich bin stolzer Besitzer einiger Modelle von Garmin, darunter eine Fenix der neuesten Generation, einer Scanwatch und einer Sport HR von Withings, einer Samsung Smartwatch aus dem Jahre 2019, einer Falster 3 von Skagen und dem Schwestermodellen von Fossil und Diesel, und meine Frau besitzt neben einer Applewatch auch noch zwei Modelle von Fitbit) den einen oder anderen teilweise schwerwiegenderen Kritikpunkt gibt.Das Gesamtpaket der Suunto 7 konnte mich jedoch im Alltag absolut \u00fcberzeugen, ist sie doch eine Gelungene Symbiose aus Smartwatch, mit all den entsprechenden Funktionalit\u00e4ten, und einer Sportuhr die zumindest f\u00fcr den ambitionierten Hobbysportler einen mehr als ausreichenden Trackingumfang bietet, wobei die Ergebnisse sehr genau sind und auch das GPS-Signal in 90% der F\u00e4lle umgehend und ohne Verz\u00f6gerung gefunden wird, was bei anderen Uhren alles andere als selbstverst\u00e4ndlich ist.Insofern m\u00f6chte ich die Suunto 7 all jenen  ans Herz legen, welche auf der Suche nach einer Smartwatch sind, welche nicht nur absolut zuverl\u00e4ssig im Alltag funktioniert, sondern ebenso zuverl\u00e4ssig jedwede sportliche Aktivit\u00e4t trackt.",
            "Je me suis laiss\u00e9 tent\u00e9 par le couple Wear OS et Suunto qui sur le papier permet d'avoir une montre connect\u00e9e avec des vraies fonctions sportives.Malheureusement, le r\u00e9sultat est mauvais.Le principal probl\u00e8me c'est l'autonomie de la montre qui est tout juste de 24h d'autonomie. Mon ancienne montre (Garmin Vivoactive 3)  a 4 jours d'autonomie.Suunto annonce jusqu'\u00e0 2 jours d'autonomie c'est impossible \u00e0 atteindre.Ensuite la montre est trop compliqu\u00e9e, m\u00e9lange Wear OS + Suunto, trop de boutons (complexit\u00e9 li\u00e9e \u00e0 Wear OS).3 applications n\u00e9cessaires sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone :- Wear OS- Suunto- Google FitDes incompr\u00e9hensions entre la partie Google & SuuntoPar exemple il y a un double comptage des pas :Via Suunto et via Google Fit et un \u00e9cart entre 10 & 20% entre les 2 (Google Fit compte moins de pas que Suunto)Autre point, Je trouvais int\u00e9ressant de pouvoir utiliser Google Pay sur la montre mais \u00e7a impose de mettre un code sur la montre (impos\u00e9 par Google Pay) et d\u00e8s qu'on enl\u00e8ve la montre (pour la charger) il faut taper le code pin. du coup j'ai d\u00e9sactiv\u00e9 Google Pay.Sur la partie sportive, la montre met plus de temps \u00e0 trouver les satellites que Garmin : 30s environ pour ma Garmin Vivoactive contre 2 min pour la Suuntoensuite j'ai eu un plantage de l'appli Suunto en courantConcernant les fonctions annexes :Chez Suunto, il n'est pas possibilit\u00e9 de tracker les km parcourus avec les chaussures (fonction disponible depuis toujours chez Garmin)Je ne trouve pas de site web pour voir les activit\u00e9s (seule une appli sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone)Conclusion : d\u00e9ception totale !!! Comment une marque renomm\u00e9e comme Suunto peut oser ventre cette montre surtout pour un prix hors promo de 450\u20ac !Du coup apr\u00e8s une semaine d'utilisation, j'ai capitul\u00e9. je retourne la montre et l\u00e0 comme d'habitude je donne 5 \u00e9toiles pour le service client Amazon."
