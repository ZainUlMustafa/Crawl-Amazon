"Garmin Venu 2, GPS Fitness Smartwatch, Slate Stainless Steel Bezel with Black Band ",https://www.amazon.com.au/Garmin-Fitness-Smartwatch-Slate-Stainless/dp/B091ZXYQXF,"[""Overall this is a great fitness watch.  It has a range of activies to choose from including run, walk, strength, cardio, (pool) swim (I think you'd need a higher spec for ocean swim), yoga, pilates and many more!It's easy to access all the menus using buttons on the side of the watch or swiping the watch face.The watch links seemlessly to your smartphone via the Garmin Connect app where you can upload all of your workouts and monitor progress at a glance.  You can track your goals, monitor heartrate and stress levels and you can even sign up for a personlised coach to take you to your first 5km, 10km or half marathon.The watch is lightweight and looks good enough that you could wear it all day.  It has a range of features designed to negate the need for carrying cards/ phone, like Garmin Pay - add bank cards to the Garmin Connect app and away you go!The watch also has the capacity to upload about 500 songs using Spotify, Amazon or other music apps and listen to them via bluetooth headphones. With phones getting bigger & heavier, who wants to carry them on your walk / run??The main reason I gave it 4 stars, not 5 was due to how hard it was to sort out the music.After synching my Spotify playlist + bluetooth headphones, I did a trial and every time I started the running app, my headphones disconnected!  After about 20 attempts and a lot of Google searching, I was able to remedy the issue, but it involved a full reset.  GRR!In my case it's because the headphones actually have a heartrate monitor in them and this was interfering with the watch's HRM.  If you have standard bluetooth earbuds, you might not have this issue.Now that I've got everything working, it really is a great watch that I enjoy using and I would highly recommend it.The price point makes it a lot more affordable than some other smart watches with similar features."", ""Beautiful looking display, but boy where's the rest of it? There's a 3mm ring of black nothing around the tiny 31mm display wasted. My old Ticwatch E (on the left in photo) is the same size watch, but it's display is much bigger.I haven't used much of the software yet, but I'm not mad on the GUI (Graphical User Interface). Thinking of returning it due to the display. Doesn't connect to my Oppo Find X2 Pro either."", 'The watch gives enough data with much better accuracy to track my daily activities and health status. The stress, sleep, and heart metrics have a higher accuracy rate.  It gives you the trend which can be interpreted according to individual.The battery life is awesome. I charge only once a week.Garmin Connect app could have a bit better.Overall this is a perfect daily use alternate smartwatch for Apple & FitBit. I loved it.', 'I bought this to monitor my sleep apart from normal activities, after a month use, I can recommend it to others. Initially, the body battery was going a bit unusual but it improved itself with time. Watch size is good for thin wrists as well. In Australia, the product price was too much so I bought it from Amazon Uk with a very competitive price, but I had to wait for a couple of week for the delivery, so be ready to wait a long time if you order from outside Australia. Lastly, the battery life is around 5-6 days, but if you use it to listen to music then get ready to charge it frequently. Overall a very good fitness watch.', ""Functions well (3rd day), power runs down quicker than expected, but probably would last six days, if not using it.  If you don't look at the screen the power will last longer.  Easily connected with my phone.  I was able to connect with my speed/cadence on my bike with no problems.  Also used in the pool for swimming."", 'Really think that Garmin has a good product in the Venu.  I understand the battery life has also been improved on the Venu 2 - which from my perspective in using the Venu now for a few weeks is a necessary thing!  Love the music and Pay functions but have reservations with use of the Golf function.  This is perhaps the only let down point as the Golf shot tracking is overly sensitive and logs shots of 0 metres on just about every hole.  These can be deleted later on with editing - but as I\'m tracking shots and club distances - this is now impacting on accuracy of measurements.  Hope this can be fixed with software tweak??  Garmin??  Other than this ""First World"" issue - a great all around activity tracking smart watch!', 'I had a Fitbit before this. Sleep monitoring is terrible in comparison - no idea when I’m awake vs light sleep. I’ll need to read instructions to do anything other than view data, it’s not especially intuitive. GPS takes a while to load before exercise and today it didn’t even know where I was, came up with a route I didn’t take! I suspect distance, pace, steps and VO2max more accurate than FitBit though - they are more conservative. Not unhappy with it, but not as happy as I expected to be ‘upgrading’ from a 3-4 year old Fitbit.', 'I wanted to love this watch as I was upgrading from a previous model. However I ended up getting a faulty unit because whenever I charged the watch as soon as it came off the charger it went dead. Every single time. It would then take me 20-30 minutes of trying multiple reset to get it to turn back on. I put up with it for almost a month until I finally have up and sent it back.', 'I am an ex Samsung Smart watch user. I recently switched to Garmin after my Samsung died out.  I bought this watch 1 and half week ago. I charged the watch as soon as I received it.  After fully charged the battery lasted for 7 days.  Compare this to the Samsung watch which needed charging every single day. The watch does everything a smart watch does and I am very pleased with it.I am in love with my new watch.', 'Have been using this Venu SQ Garmin for the last 3 months - it is an awesome health and fitness tracker but I do feel it can improve slightly on tracking sleep - but everything else is really great!', ""I have moved from a fairly simple Fitbit Charge 2 watch to this one, so I had great expectations. Being a golfer the golf app was something I was keen to use and was not disappointed. I am just starting to get a full understanding of how this watch works, but for now I'm very happy with it."", ""I bought this watch to replace a Samsung Active2 watch. The Samsung was very stylish but HR was inaccurate and it doesn't measure spo2. The Garmin has worked perfectly. The app is not as good as STEALTH, but overall I much prefer the Garmin."", 'The watch was really good but the screen stopped working in less than a month. Had to return it and buy a another one.', 'We bough this for my boss who has increased her fitness last year for her to track her workouts and reach her goals.  She absolutely loves it and recommends it to anyone looking for a product like this.', ""Brought it as a birthday present my wife loves the look and functionality and know doesn't know what it was like with out it."", 'I love my new watch. It provides me with all I data I need to track my goals, gains and health. Excellent cost vs benefits.', 'Looks great and my husbands now has no reason to complain that he is tired as watch shows ‘sleep scores’. Pretty amazing.', 'Bought the  Garmin for my wife.. We both had Polar sport watches, which kept failing to charge..My wife loves her new Garmin.  No complaints at all. !', 'It does everything as advertised. Great for the price. The OLED screen is nice. Battery lasts about two days.', 'Looks good on the website site but the software is like a toy watch. Disappointed purchase.', 'bought for my better half for Christmas, she has nothing but praise, cannot fault it.', ""It's amazing very happy."", 'Wonderful product and very accurate description', 'buttons would not work!!!!', 'no', 'Value for money. Working excellent', 'I owned several watches and this is my favourite. I owned a FitBit, a Polar Ignite an Apple Watch Series 3 and now this.This Garmin is a fitness tracker with some smart watch features. It does what a fitness tracker tends to do, i.e., track steps, heart rate, distance travelled and has GPS so you don’t need to bring the phone with you. It has some extra tracking features like stress tracking and period tracking. I am going to make a quick comparison with the other watches.Sleep tracking. For me the FitBit, Apple Watch and Polar Ignite all had better sleep tracking. The Garmin Venu SQ has issues with detecting when you wake up and when you fall asleep. There was a night where I got up for a few minutes and the Garmin did not register that as being awake. It might be a fit issue as sometimes it’s more accurate than others.So Garmin Venu Sq loses on the sleep tracking.Sport Tracking.It’s almost on par with the Ignite. You can view your training load with the Ignite (on the Polar website), whereas with the Garmin you can’t. Although it shows you your weekly average of activity, albeit it isn’t quite the same thing. Garmin has a few built-in walking/running/cycling challenges, akin to those of Strava, which the Ignite does not have. I haven’t used the coaching features on the watches so I can’t comment as I find them limiting and they are good for generic strength training or running. I follow my own programs.The Garmin app lets you make a note of exercises and reps, although if an exercise is missing you can’t add it to the app.The Garmin app notifies you with insights, like how many times you have hit your step goal, and it has a function to increase it automatically if you wish to. It also gives you badges for hitting activity milestones, which is more similar to what the Apple Watch does. They both attempt to gamify exercise somewhat whereas the Polar is serious business. The FitBit has activity and step tracking, but trying to view your routes is hidden behind a subscription. For the other Watches you don’t pay any extra for this.The Apple Watch default fitness app lets you track distance, steps, heart rate like the other watches and also offers trend insights. No built-in training load like this Garmin.Garmin Venu SW sport tracking is pretty good. It depends on what you look for in your sport tracking, but if training load is essential (without having to pay for third party apps), then the Ignite just inches ahead.“Health Tracking”I put it in quotes because all these watch companies add these features and then say they are not health features. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) tracking is done differently on all these devices.I prefer the Garmin and the Polar way. Polar tracks your HRV overnight and tells you if you are recovered the next day (together with sleep data). Garmin does it throughout the day, through a system called Body Battery. It uses HRV with other information to tell you whether you are stressed (physiologically or mentally) or whether you are resting during the day. It was able to detect when I was highly stressed after an argument and even sent me an alert in that case. It makes you aware of correlations between how you feel and what you did that might have caused it.For example, I had an ice cream fairly late in the evening. I thought I slept okay because I didn’t remember waking up but I didn’t feel rested. When I looked at the Body Battery I noticed that it wasn’t until 3/4 am that my body had actually started recovering. Given that I didn’t fall asleep any later than usual I wouldn’t have made the connection with the ice cream, but we ain’t having that in the evening anymore.HRV tracking on the FitBit requires subscription.HRV Tracking on the Apple Watch is not reliable. It tries to take readings when it sees you are relaxed or sleeping, an they are very short samples. With 3rd party apps and the use of Apple’s own Breathe app you can force readings and analyse them properly, but the Apple Watch at the moment is just a bit lacklustre in this department.So for HRV Polar and Garmin are a tie and the approach you have to HRV will be the deciding factor on who wins.Cycle tracking. They all do it quite well aside from the Ignite, which doesn’t have it at all. It’s quite a big omission for women, as it absolutely influences the way I train. It’s one of the main drivers of how I feel through the month. The Garmin also lets you add some extra notes, and not just some preset symptoms. so Garmin Venu Sq wins this one.Food TrackingFitBit wins this one as it has food tracking built in.Polar Ignite does not have it at all.Both Garmin Venu Sq and Apple Watch require and integrate with third party apps. The Venu however only works with MyFitnessPal.Pulse OximetryThe Apple Watch Series 3 and the Ignite don’t have it. The FitBit Versa 3 (which is of comparable price if I recall correctly) has it and so does this Garmin. That said, pulse ox on watches are unreliable, so you might as well not use it.Battery LifeFitBit and Garmin have similar battery life. Up to 5/6 days. The Ignite has around 3 1/2 and the Apple Watch Series 3 has 18 hours. I really love not having to charge my Garmin every day.Smart Watch FeaturesThe Apple Watch here wins by a mile. Many apps, granular control over notifications, Siri.Fitbit depends on what you buy, but even the cheap FitBits let you choose which app can send notifications to your phone. I haven’t seen the FitBit app store but I hear it has a limited amount of apps.Garmin Venu Sq has the ability to choose between phone notifications, message notifications and app notifications, but you can’t choose which apps. You can also turn off notifications during activity. It has access to a store but like the FitBit it has limited apps.The Ignite is only a sport watch. No apps and notifications are an all or nothing affair.ScreenI didn’t own a comparable FitBit so I can’t comment. The Apple Watch Screen is my favourite. The Garmin’s screen is decent but smaller. I really do not like the Ignite’s screen, it’s not very responsive.CONCLUSIONSo all in all, the Garmin Venu Sq is a jack of all trade watch that does most things decently and some quite well. The only other watch that has better flexibility is the Apple Watch Series 3, which is slightly more expensive and  has worse battery life. If you don’t have an iPhone the Apple Watch is out of the equation.Given it’s all around capabilities, how good Body Battery is, how the app presents the information in a way that is easy to make correlations and the longer battery life, the Garmin Venu Sq is my choice at this price range and I recommend it. Whilst the FitBit has good “health” tracking capabilities you have to pay extra for things like HRV tracking, so again the Garmin wins here.', ""Moin!=========Update=========Soooooo. Wir zwei haben nun eine ganze Weile miteinander verbracht. Sonst habe ich sehr gern meine Samsung Galaxy Watch getragen. Und? Ich habe mehrere Monate komplett drauf verzichtet. Das lag vor allem aber daran, dass mir der Smartwatch-Anteil eine lange Zeit nicht fehlte. Da überwog einfach der Wunsch nach einem Fitnesstracker. Der Bereich ist hier für mich auch weiterhin einfach überragend. Der Plan zum Joggen passt sich immer wieder individuell an und ist höflich zu mir, wenn mich dann doch mal über Wochen die Faulheit am Sofa festhält. Erstaunlicherweise funktioniert das Tracken hier tadellos und irgendwie scheinen die Satelliten sonst einen relativ großen Bogen um unser Gebiet zu machen. 😉 Zwischenzeitlich war ich für einige Wochen zu meiner Galaxy Watch zurückgekehrt. Warum? Hier ist einfach das Aufladen zu nervig. Man muss dies zwar selten machen, muss dann aber bei bedarf ein Kabel an der Rückseite reinfriemeln, welches in meinen Augen dazu viel zu kurz ist. Jedes Mal krieche ich dafür halb hinters Sofa, da es auf der Armlehne nicht liegen bleiben möchte. Mittlerweile bin ich wieder bei der Garmin, das Wetter passt und der Bewegungsdrang ist wieder da.Wer keine Smartwatch sucht, sondern einen Fitnesstracker, der ist hier absolut richtig! Auch nach längerer Nutzung und so einigen Updates würde ich diese Uhr noch immer nicht als Smartwatch bezeichnen. Nicht sehr smart aber viel watch und noch mehr Fitnesstracker.Ursprüngliche Rezension:Dies ist nicht meine erste Smartwatch. Recht zu Beginn bin ich 2014 mit der Moto360 von Motorola eingestiegen und dann 2016 auf die Moto360 2nd Gen. umgestiegen. Bei der Motorola war ich von Beginn an sehr begeistert vom Betriebssystem. Die Uhr war zwar nicht sehr eigenständig, hat jedoch alles gespiegelt, was auf dem Handy passierte. Nur leider hat Motorola nie ein schönes Design geschaffen und so bin ich dann 2018 auf die Samsung Galaxy Watch umgestiegen. Hier gabs dann eine wirklich großartige Optik, aber eine sehr begrenzte Funktionalität als Spiegel des Handys. Die Abteilung Sport war bei der Galaxy Watch schon recht ausgeprägt, nur leider hatte die Uhr bei mir beim Joggen immer Probleme mit dem GPS. Und nun? Eine Smartwatch von Garmin, die schon in der Werbung ein brillantes Display verspricht und noch dazu aussieht wie eine normale Uhr? Na dann mal los! 😉Diese Rezension wird vorlaufend weiterentwickelt, da die Uhr erst mit der Zeit zeigen wird, was sie alles kann.=========Design=========Die Uhr hat ein recht schlichtes Design und erinnert mich stark an die Samsung Galaxy Watch. Sie besteht komplett aus Plastik und hat eine optisch abgesetzte Lünette. Das Display ist leicht erhaben, was in meinen Augen der Garant dafür ist, dass man damit früher oder später irgendwo hängen bleibt und so ein Sprung droht. Ich habe mir jedoch bereits eine Schutzfolie bestellt und hoffe, dass so Schlimmeres verhindert wird. Das mitgelieferte Armband ist aus Gummi und riecht recht stark, lässt sich jedoch sehr simpel gegen ein anderes Armband tauschen. Rechts am Gehäuse befinden sich zwei Knöpfe.Im Vergleich zu anderen Smartwatches ist dieses Model doch recht leicht.=========Features=========Direkt von Anfang an zeigt sich, wofür diese Uhr eigentlich gedacht ist. Für mich zeigt sich diese Smartwatch weniger als Smartwatch, denn eher als Fitnesstracker. Es mag sein, dass ich in den Einstellungen noch nicht das Richtige gefunden habe, aber die Benachrichtigung vom Handy funktioniert entweder stark verzögert oder gar nicht.-Wecker – Ich habe einen leichten Schlaf und habe mich bei meiner Galaxy Watch daran gewöhnt, mich lediglich mittels Vibrationsalarm morgens wecken zu lassen. Dies funktioniert auch mit diesem Model wirklich großartig.-Werte im Alltag checken – Die Uhr konzentriert sich den ganzen Tag auf meine Bewegungsabläufe, Puls, gelaufene Schritte und lustigerweise auch mein Stresslevel. Erstaunlicherweise macht sie das auch wirklich gut. So bekam ich in einer mehr als nervenaufreibenden Vorlesung plötzlich die Info „Ihr Stresslevel ist zu hoch“. Das spiegelte in dem Moment genau mein Gefühl wieder! 😉-Sport – Das werde ich die Tage auf jeden Fall testen. Bei schlechtem Wetter finde ich einfach zu viele Ausreden.=========Funktionalität=========Der Akku macht bislang einen sehr guten Eindruck. Nicht wie bei anderen Smartwatches, muss diese Uhr nicht jeden Abend auf die Station. Da sind wir aber schon bei einem Problem. Statt die Uhr einfach auf eine Ladestation zu legen, darf man bei diesem Gerät einen Stecker in die Uhr frickeln, in meinen Augen nicht sehr zeitgemäß, das geht auf jeden Fall besser!Des Weiteren zeigt diese Uhr teilweise eine doch recht schwache Performance.  Die Smartwatch verliert immer wieder die Verbindung zum Handy oder es wird mir auf dem Handy eine Fehlermeldung angezeigt, dass die Android Benachrichtigung beendet wurde, was jedes Mal den Neustart meines Handys verlangt. Auch scheint der RAM-Speicher bei dieser Uhr nicht ausreichend zu sein, so wirkt die Bedienung oft ruckelig und es treten Latenzprobleme auf. Das Touchdisplay ist nicht sehr sensibel und so darf man öfter mehrmals wischen, ehe man das gewünschte Ergebnis erzielt. Ein kleiner Tipp am Rande. Nicht die App „Sleep with Android“ runterladen. Bei dieser App stürzt bei mir die Uhr jedes Mal ab und wünscht einen Neustart.Alles in Allem ist die Menüführung nicht sehr intuitiv, nicht innovativ und arg ruckelig. Die Smartwatch läuft ordentlich, da ist jedoch noch sehr viel Luft nach Oben.Ich hoffe, meine Rezension war Ihnen behilflich. 😊 Vielen Dank für's Lesen."", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Questa è la mia prima esperienza con Garmin, ho avuto in passato sempre altri smart e sportwatch, (fitbit, huawei, huami, amazfit e xiaomi) e questo Venu SQ è stata una bella sorpresa.Avevo bisogno di un prodotto che monitorasse la corsa in modo efficace e questo smartwatch è perfetto sotto ogni punto di vista senza dover spendere un capitale. Premetto quindi che questa mia recensione tiene in considerazione solo la corsa e non gli altri sport.Elencherò in modo sintetico cosa mi è piaciuto e cosa no:✅ E' molto elegante, abbastanza discreto, sta bene su qualsiasi polso ed è talmente leggero che non ci si accorge di averlo al polso. Utilizzato anche per dormire non da assolutamente fastidio.✅ Il display sfrutta la tecnologia LCD, ha una risoluzione di 240x240 px e non ha always on. Pensavo che questo sarebbe stato un problema ed invece lo schermo si vede benissimo in qualsiasi condizione, sembra di avere uno schermo oled, e la gesture per l'attivazione dello schermo è precisa, non sbaglia mai un colpo, veramente ottimo !!! Anche se lo schermo è piccolo rispetto ad altri smartwatch che ho avuto in passato si vede tutto benissimo.✅ Il sensore cardio è molto preciso e legge in modo veloce le variazioni, cosa estremamente utile nello sport. E' possibile impostare una lettura H24 con modalità intelligente oppure continua (ogni secondo). Queste impostazioni possono essere settate o da app oppure direttamente nell'orologio. E' possibile impostare degli avvisi di frequenza alta o bassa durante l'attività e anche durante la giornata intera. E' possibile disattivare il monitoraggio cardio H24.✅ Ha lettura dell'ossigenazione del sangue, SpO2, che può essere monitorata durante tutta la giornata oppure solo durante il sonno, oppure può essere disattivata e quindi la lettura può essere effettuata manualmente.✅ Il sensore GPS e veloce e preciso. Si può scegliere solo GPS, GPS + Glonass oppure GPS + Galileo. Tramite queste opzioni la triangolazione e quindi la traccia ottenuta è precisa e l'aggancio al satellite avviene in max 7 secondi.✅ Il monitoraggio della corsa è pressoché perfetto. Vi sono moltissime opzioni e parametri, è possibile aggiungere dei campi dati alla corsa, ogni schermata può essere modificata con i dati a proprio piacimento, c'è l'auto pausa, a corsa avviata è possibile modificare determinati parametri, insomma c'è tutto l'occorrente per anche il più esigente degli utenti. Fantastico !✅ E' presente anche un sistema di sicurezza di rilevazione incidenti, quindi se avviene una caduta viene mandato un messaggio di emergenza con la posizione GPS a determinati contatti preimpostati nell'app sul telefono. Ovvio che per usufruire di questa opzione è necessario avere con se il telefono.✅ E' possibile avviare un live track dell'attività sportiva svolta e condividerla con i propri contatti. In questo modo da remoto il vostro contatto potrà visualizzare in tempo reale la vostra attività. Anche in questo caso è necessario avere con se il telefono.✅ Finalmente uno smartwatch che opera veramente in multitasking. Se fate partire un'attività, tramite swipe a sisnitra, potrete tornare alla home e da li avere accesso a tutto i parametri, widget, app, ecc. dello smartwatch. La vostra attività rimarrà attiva in background. Potete inoltre ricevere anche ad attività avviata tutte le notifiche, impostazione settabile a proprio piacimento.✅ Cosa da non sottovalutare, questo smartwatch è affidabile ! Il software non si incarta, non lagga, il sistema operativo è ben studiato, funziona tutto alla grande.✅ Il punto forte di questo e di tutti i prodotti garmin è il software. Il migliore fino ad ora provato ! Garmin Connect gestisce in modo perfetto il sync tra orologio e telefono. Notifiche puntuali e precise, tra l'altro è possibile rispondere direttamente da orologio tramite messaggi preimpostati, e sync perfetto. L'app è veramente completa e ben fatta. E' possibile tramite garmin coach, avere degli allenamenti preimpostati oppure crearne nuovi a proprie esigenze. E' una funziona che non ho testato benissimo, ma è un valore aggiunto di non poco conto. Per aggiungere ulteriori funzionalità allo smartwatch, app, widget campi dati e watchface, bisogna scaricare un'altra app, uno store ogni giorno sempre più aggiornato chiamato Connect IQ, dalla quale è possibile aggiungere app e widget allo smartwatch, aggiungere e modificare watchface. Insomma, oltre ad avere un ottimo prodotto al polso è fondamentale avere un ottimo software a supporto e a mio avviso da questo punto di vista Garmin non ha rivali.✅ Durante la giornata viene monitorato lo stress e quindi viene calcolato il body battery, ovvero un'indicazione della carica energetica del vostro corpo, veramente utile per trovare il miglior periodo della giornata per effettuare un'attività. E' una funzione molto valida e utile, e funziona alla grande !!✅ E possibile controllare qualsiasi lettore audio in esecuzione sul telefono, quindi si può alzare il volume, play / pausa  e skip dei pezzi.✅ E' presente Garmin Pay, quindi associata la vostra carta di credito, potrete in tutta sicurezza effettuare pagamenti con il vostro smartwatch sfruttando la funzione contactless (NFC) integrata. Dovrete impostare una passkey che dovrete quindi inserire prima di effettuare il pagamento. Il sistema è super sicuro e funziona alla perfezione.✅ E' possibile settare sveglie, timer, aumentare o abbassare la luminosità automatica su 3 livelli (c'è un sensore automatico della luminosità che lavora in modo estremamente efficace e veloce), è possibile disattivare il Bluetooth (cosa non presente su nessun smartwatch che fino ad ora ho provato), ricercare il telefono e tutte le maggiori funzioni presenti in tutti questi device. E' possibile rispondere e/o rifiutare le chiamate in arrivo.✅ Il monitoraggio del sonno è preciso, vengono calcolati parametri quali sonno profondo, leggero e rem. Viene inoltre calcolato il numero delle volte che si respira ogni minuto (anche di giorno questo avviene), e quanto ci si muove nel letto. Unito al monitoraggio cardio e  dello stress si ha un quadro davvero completo del proprio sonno, molto utile dopo un'attività o durante un periodo di allenamento intensivo.✅ Ogni singola opzione, ad esempio gli avvisi cardio o altre impostazioni  sono attivabili sia dall'app del telefono che direttamente sullo smartwatch. E' possibile inoltre collegare, quindi fare sync e impostare vari settaggi, lo smartwatch al proprio PC, Win e Mac, tramite l'app Garmin Express.✅ Se siete super smanettoni Garmin mette a disposizione il pacchetto SDK per poter sviluppare tramite linguaggio prioritario, praticamente simile al C, app, widget, watchface in ambiente Clipper. C'è una community molto attiva in tal senso e quindi se vorrete cimentarvi alla creazione troverete un valido supporto e valida documentazione.  La possibilità quindi di poter collegare lo smartwatch al PC è fondamentale ed estremamente utile per testare le vostre creazioni, app, watchfaces o widget.✅ L'autonomia è quella dichiarata. Senza attività sportiva e quindi solo con notifiche, monitoraggio cardio H24 in modalità smart e senza SpO2 si fanno 6 giorni e mezzo. Con due attività di 1 ora si arriva a fare 5 giorni. Dipende poi dall'utilizzo, dalla watchface utilizzata (alcune hanno attività in bagkround che consumano di più). Il calcolo più o meno è un 10% circa di consumo con attività e opzione GPS+Galileo (solo GPS consuma un 2/3% in meno), e con un'utilizzo medio / intenso il consumo a giornata, incluso sonno, è circa un 15/20% giorno (smanettamenti, installare e disinstallare app e un discreto numero di notifiche). La ricarica avviene in modo rapido, quindi in circa 45 minuti si passa da un 15% a un 85%. Insomma l'autonomia non sarà un problema.✅ E' da circa 3 settimane che ho questo smartwatch ed ho già ricevuto 3 aggiornamenti software. Viene aggiornato anche il software dei sensori, e del gps. Insomma supporto totale da parte di Garmin.✅ Ho avuto molti smartwatch in passato ed ho una discreta esperienza in merito, quindi posso affermare che questo Garmin Venu SQ è un prodotto veramente completo sotto ogni punto di vista. Per quanto riguarda la corsa possono essere monitorati molti parametri. A primo impatto può sembrare difficile e complicato la sua gestione, ci sono 2 app da mettere sul telefono,  i parametri e le opzioni che sono presenti nello smartwatch sono molti, ma dopo qualche giorno vi renderete conto che il tutto in realtà è molto semplice e super funzionale, molto ben progettato e studiato alla perfezione per poter venire incontro anche all'utente più esigente. Per le funzionalità che ha e per  la fascia di prezzo che viene proposto  a mio avviso questo è il miglior e il più completo prodotto presente sul mercato !L'unica cosa che non mi è piaciuta è la lentezza della sincronizzazione tra smartwatch e telefono, ma è un dettaglio altamente trascurabile.Se siete quindi alla ricerca di un dispositivo per il monitoraggio dell'attività sportiva, da non spendere un capitale, questo è lo smart/sport watch perfetto. Brava Garmin ! 😀😀"", ""OverviewI have long been a loyal user of running watches produced by Garmin and my most recent (and previously much loved) watch is this Garmin Vivo Active 3. I have also road tested the Polar Vantage M, the Polar Ignite recently and now this new Garmin Venu. I typically run 50km to 60km per week (combination of trails and on road) and also use the watches for multi-sports such as weight training, spinning etc. My review below contains the detail but in summary I absolutely love this watch, its functionality and its high quality screen are exactly what was needed in this now quite crowded sports/activity tracking watch area. When combined with the Garmin app you really do have a 5* product which will help with monitoring health and performance.Set Up:- You can set up the watch with or without the Garmin App. It is recommended to use the app and therefore I did (I also love analyising my fitness data so a watch which isn’t syncing with an app is no fun for me).- The watch was easy to set up and both the watch and App were intuitive to use.Charging- The watch arrived with 52% battery power. It comes with a USB charger (note: no mains plug, you will either need to charge via a laptop or a mains to USB charger). The watch attaches to the charger via an each magnetic connection.- The watch went from out of box to being 100% charged in less than 1 hour (via mains).- The charger is a small clip in which attaches to the back of the watch. It attaches easily (it is the same connector as the Vivoactive, a watch with which I have had no charging mishaps in the past and therefore seems to be a robust and reliable system).Aesthetics, general wearability and day to day use- The Garmin Venu looks very good on my wrist, it is a nice size for day to day wear (it is slightly deeper than the Vivoactive 3 but the screen size is about the same size).- It is light and as a result it was easy to forget I was wearing it. It is only 46g (3g heavier than the Vivoactive 3)- The strap is soft and pliable (other running watches such as the the cheaper Polar watches have quite stiff straps).Ease of Operation:- The watch is operated largely by touch screen (there are two buttons on the side of the watch, one which starts/stops activities and can be used a a selector button, the other which is mainly used to access the main menu/settings). I really like the intuitive and easy to use touch screen ability – it feels modern and up to date but more importantly it is very quick to navigate.- To start training you select the top button on the device and then scroll to find the activity you want to start. You can set the watch up so your most frequently used activities are listed up front for a quick start. There are many pre-programmed activities but I have mainly used the running (outdoors), treadmill running, indoor cycling and strength training activities.- The activity is paused by pressing the same button and then the touch screen gives end and save options. I have found that the watch is quicker to start/stop/change activities than the Vivoactive 3 is.GPS log on- There is nothing more frustrating then your watch taking a long time to log onto the GPS signal when you just want to start running, I was concerned about this having read other reviews of this watch.- I had no siginifcant issues with the GPS link up. I have used the watch in a small town, a city, at the start of many races and in the countryside when trail running and the GPS log on was adequate in all locations (usually almost immediate but on rare and more frustrating occasions up to 1 minute).- It is worth noting that the Polar watch I have road tested often found GPS signal before the Garmin watches when I wear them side by side.Activities/Running/Distance Accuracy/GPS- As a runner this is what is most important to me.- The outdoor running accuracy appears to be incredibly good. IMy Vivoactive 3 has matched (with very small tolerances) with official race measured distances in anything from 5km to 30km races. When I tested this Venu vs the Vivoactive 3 (wearing both on the same two runs) they measured almost exactly the same.- On set up I selected automatic pause so when I stop running, for example at traffic lights, the device automatically pauses and then restarts tracking once I am running again. This feature worked well.- I like the strength training rep counter although I don’t always use it (unless I am wanting to deliberately slow down my work rate)Data screens- Along side the accuracy of data the availability of data whilst running is important to me.- Each data screen can hold 4 pieces of data (e.g. pace, distance, time etc.).- You can customise what data you have via the app.- The data was easy to see whilst running and gave me the information I needed to monitor and improve my performance.Display- The display graphics on the Venu and amazing compared to the Vivoactive 3, I am hugely surprised by the improvement. I have photographed the two watches side by side, the Venu on the top is so much better than the Vivoactive 3. It also looks much more modern in terms of what is displayed on the screen, the layout etc.- I really enjoy the fact that you can customise what data you have on your standard watch screen. I have mine set up to show digital time, date and step count. It did take a bit of time to work out how to do this but worth it once you have it working in the way you want it to.Interaction with other devices and apps- In common with all runners I know I like to be able to analyse my running data and look at details such as my heart rate, pace and so on over the course of a run.- The Venu uses the Garmin Connect app to do this (note you can have more than one Garmin device paired up with the app on your phone). The watch is quick to syncronise and does this itself after activities. It can also be forced via the app.- The have my Garmin App (and therefore the watch data) also syncronised to MyFitnessPal so that my calories burnt are sent over to MFP and calories consumed are sent from MFP to the Garmin (watch and app).As a training aide- Being able to pre-program workouts before setting off makes for much easier interval training.- I use the Garmin to write a training plan with specific work-outs (e.g. interval training) and these then become available in the watch on syncing the two together.- The data you get on the watch at the end of the run is not that extensive (the Polar watch may be better for you if you want this on the watch) but the data in the app is extensive and useful for a post race or run postmortem.Battery life- The battery life on the Venu is very good, but outperformed by the Polar by about 10% when both had the same features engaged (e.g. continuous heart rate monitoring). The increased screen quality is however worth the impact on battery life!- As part of my testing I charged it up and took the Venu out for a 3 hour trail jaunt, using GPS the whole time. I came back with just under 50% battery so happy enough with that and it ties into the 6 hours of GPS usage battery claim.Garmin App- The Garmin Connect App is what takes this watch from a very good 4* product to a 5* watch for me.- It is a real life tracker. I track my weight (and my BMI which is automatically tracks), my steps, my menstrual cycle, my calories in (and out, via a link up with MFP), I analyse my run and race results, set and monitor step (and other activity) goals – I must look at the App on average 10 times per day.- The App is easy to use, intuitive and I honestly believe it has contributed to me developing an even healthier lifestyle.- The app is the reason why I can’t see myself moving away from Garmin when I need my next running watch/activity tracker.- As an aside I find the 24/7 heart rate monitoring offered by Garmin devices to be incredibly helpful. I normally can work out I am going down will and illness about 12 hours before hand because of my slightly raised resting heart rate etc.Other features- The ‘sleep’ feature ion the Venu is more accurate than on the Vivoactive 3 which seems to think I’m asleep from the minute I get into bed and start reading until I get up in the morning.- I had the watch paired with my phone all day via the Garmin Connect app so I could receive message etc. notifications – a useful function but it does drain the battery more quickly.In summary the Garmin Venu is an amazing watch supported by a brilliant app and I would not hesitate to recommend it.Update 9th July 2021: After almost 2 years of daily usage, this watch has suddenly encountered a problem where it no longer charges up. I've tried various cables and chargers which work fine on other Garmin watches. After contacting Garmin customer services, they immediately acknowledged the problem and will take back the watch and send a refurbished replacement. This has now been posted back now. So far, first impressions of customer service is very impressive. I will update once matter is resolved.Update 14th July 2021: The refurbished replacement has arrived today, and as far as I can see, it's a in as good as new condition everything seems to work just fine including charging! setting it up was a breeze, just sync up to your phone app and all the settings are transferred across and all ready to go with minimum fuss. Impressive customer service!"", 'Ich bin wohl einer der ersten, die diese Uhr erhalten hat und möchte auf meine Erfahrungen mit ihr eingehen.Seit geraumer Zeit schon suche ich eine Alternative zur Apple Watch für Android User, vorzugsweise mit längerer Akkulaufzeit.Uhren, die ich bisher besessen oder getestet habe:- Android wear von sony (genutzt)- Amazfit verge (genutzt)- Amazfit BIP S (genutzt)- Amazfit GTR 2 (getestet und zurück geschickt)- Garmin Venu (1) (getestet und zurück geschickt- Amazfit GTS 2 Mini (genutzt)- Garmin Vivomove Luxe (genutzt, aktuelle Uhr)Und jetzt sollte nach meiner negativen Erfahrung mit der Venu 1, die Venu 2 (als kleine S) noch einen Versuch bekommen.Die Uhr wurde auf Herz und Nieren geprüft und hier die Pros, Cons und neutralen Punkte:Pro:- Herzfrequenzmessung ist merklich besser als die vorherige Generation von Garmin (Vivomove Luxe, Venu 1), aber nicht auf dem Level einer Apple watch. Dennoch ist die Venu 2 bisher die einzige Uhr, die HIIT einigermaßen verfolgen kann und kein Apple Logo besitzt. Deshalb gibt es hier zähneknirschend ein Lob.- die Größe, auch hier gibt es ein vorsichtiges Lob, weil die Uhr immer noch recht dick ist. Trotzdem, die S Version, verglichen mit den meisten anderen Uhren schön klein.- die Garmin Umgebung. Also App, Einstellungen, sync Möglichkeiten, das ist schon deutlich besser als der Abklatsch von Amazfit. Man merkt auch extrem, dass sich Amazfit hier an Garmin ""orientiert"", aber es eben nicht in gleicher Qualität kopieren kann.- Genauigkeit der restlichen Sensoren, also GPS, Barometer etc. Scheint allesamt besser zu sein als bei der vorherigen Generation. Wobei es jetzt nicht verlgleichbar ist mit dem GPS meines OnePlus 8 Pro, aber Smartphones haben generell ein besseres GPS als Uhren. Es ist auf jeden Fall genau genug und leistet sich wenige Fehler, der Barometer im Gegensatz zur Luxe brauchbar, passt.So die neutralen Punkte:- Display. Ja, Amoled, ja endlich mit dem Glas verklebt und besser als von der Venu 1, aber ganz ehrlich, so nebeneinander ist das Display der 90 Euro ""teuren"" Amazfit GTS 2 nicht schlechter. Wenn ich jetzt entscheiden müsste, welches subjektiv gesehen schöner ist, dann tendiere ich sogar zur billigen Amazfit. Bei einem Preis von 400 Euro ist das maximal ein neutral Punkt, weil ein schlechteres Display als das, wäre negativ.- Bedienung der Uhr. Die ist ok. Wischgesten werden nicht ganz zuverlässig erkannt, dafür ist sie einigermaßen durchdacht. Aber auch hier bewegen wir uns natürlich in einem Preisbereich, in dem die Konkurrenz, natürlich meine ich Apple, ganz andere Maßstäbe setzt. Aber man kommt zurecht, also neutral.- Akkulaufzeit. Ja, die ist jetzt auch ""ok"". Mit Blutsauerstoffmessung über Nacht und ab und zu GPS muss man sie spätestens alle 3 Tage laden. Wie Garmin auf die unrealistischen Werksangaben kommt wissen nur die Götter. Laufzeit also sehr verlgleichbar mit meiner Vivomove Luxe und damit noch ok. Dennoch muss man erwähnen, dass eine GTS 2 Mini problemlos über eine Woche MIT Always on Display kommt, das ist bei Garmin nämlich nicht aktiviert, dazu komme ich bei den Cons.Cons:- Gehäusequalität. Ganz ehrlich, meiner Meinung nach eine Frechheit für das Geld. Die oben erwähnte 90 Euro Amazfit Uhr wirkt hochwertiger, mit chinesischen Herstellern im 150€ Bereich braucht die Uhr sich gar nicht versuchen zu messen. Ja etwas Metall um das Glas aber dann ist es doch ein grenzwertig verarbeiteter plastik Klotz. Hätte ich eine Alternative zur Uhr für Android wäre das auf jeden Fall ein Ausschlusskriterium. Garmin kann es besser, die (auch überteuerte) Vivomove Luxe ist komplett aus Metall, sie wollen nur scheinbar nicht.- Garmins Produktpolitik. Ich mag es einfach nicht, wenn Funktionen, die die Uhr grundsätzlich problemlos ausführen könnte, der teureren Fenix vorbehalten sind. Reine Software Abgrenzungen um ein teureres Produkt zu rechtfertigen (das dann wiederum andere Dinge nicht kann). Find ich nicht gut, gibt ein con. Konkret geht es um Kartennavigation. Könnte die Uhr, kann Garmin, aber sie macht es eben nicht.- Akkulaufzeit bei Always on display. Ja was soll ich sagen, man kann das Display zwar Always on haben, aber die Nutzbarkeit der Uhr ist damit vorbei weil sie schneller leer ist als man bis 3 zählen kann. Andere können das VIEL besser.- Displayränder und Wertigkeitseindruck. Diese beiden Punkte gehen Hand in Hand. Was unterscheidet 2021 Smartphones optisch von 2015? Genau, die Displayränder. Viel Rand ohne Funktion wirkt alt und in einer Uhr, auf der das Display ohnehin generell zu klein ist, ist das wichtiger als im Smartphone. Und dann kommt Garmin 2021 mit einer Uhr die Rand über Rand hat. Damit meine ich erstmal Rand um den Bildschirm, dann nochmal die Metallumrandung, völlig ohne Funktion, dazu. Es wirkt einfach billig, es tut weh zu sehen welche Schmuckstücke man bei Apple fürs gleiche Geld bekommt...- Ladestecker. Ja was soll ich sagen, nichts ist nerviger als eigenartige Ladestecker die nur für die Uhr passen und sonst für nichts. Man muss immer das eine Kabel dabei haben, generell ist das eine Kabel verlegt, es ist nervig. Bei der billiguhr egal, aber eine 400€ Uhr in 2021 muss drahtlos laden können. Da gibt\'s auch keine Diskussion. Kann sie nicht, also con.- Softwarequalität dieser Venu 2. Ich hätte große Probleme. Sie hängt sich auf, Update funktioniert nicht, Apps laden funktioniert nicht, was ich mich alleine am ersten Tag herum geärgert habe. Unglaublich. Ich hatte hier schon ein 1 Stern review stehen, dass ich mittlerweile korrigiert habe. Ja, ich bin einer der ersten der die Uhr gekauft hat aber das war schon unter aller Kanone.Ja was ist also das Fazit?Ich befinde mich in der dummen Situation, dass ich die Uhr wahrscheinlich behalten werde, schlichtweg weil es derzeit keine Alternativen gibt für Android.- Samsung hat noch schlechteren Akku und der herzfrenzsensor ist mies- Polar hat noch mehr plastik und schlechtere Messung- amazfit baut schöne schicke Uhren aber die Qualität der Sportmessungen ist unter aller Kanone bei den top Modellen, software grenzwertig- Huawei ist so ein Mittelding aus Samsung und amazfit, auch da gibt\'s keine Uhr die man wirklich als Alternative zur Apple watch ansehen kann- sämtliche Android wear Uhren disqualifizieren sich durch die Akkulaufzeit und die, die es nicht tun durch Größe und messungenauigkeiten.Ich fühle mich als Android Nutzer als wie der amerikanische Wähler an der Wahlurne 2016, ich habe mich für die Venu 2 entschieden, aber eigentlich wünsche ich mir etwas anderes.', ""I bought this watch as a replacement for a Vivoactive 3. I wanted a newer watch with a nicer display, and better heartrate tracking accuracy. The Vivoactive 3 was never quite amazing at tracking my heartrate through the HIIT nature of powerlifting, and I could be out of breath to the point of needing to bend over to catch my breath after a heavy set of squats and my heartrate would register 99, with the Vivoactive 3 finally registering properly when my heartrate dropped to around 130 bpm.After doing some research on other brands in case I wanted to switch (investigated Fitbit, Amazfit and others), I decided to stick with Garmin for the better battery life, GPS accuracy, body battery feature, and the fact that you can put your own music on the Venu 2/2s whereas Fitbit has removed that feature in favour of streaming only. I use YouTube music, so only supporting Spotify/Deezer on the Fitbits was no deal for me. Amazfit's heart tracking is around as accurate as my Vivoactive 3 if not worse from the reviews I watched analyzing it, so that was also a no-go.In short, the display is lovely, the built-in watch face in the photo fits my preferences perfectly so going to the Connect store for one was not necessary, and the heart rate tracking keeps up with my lifts. Instead of the watch thinking I haven't hit my intensity minutes goals, it realises I do 200-300 per week with my training.The negative reviews here are mostly strikes against the cost of this device for the tracking and accuracy of the metrics vs other cheaper Garmin devices. Remember here that you are paying premium for a nice-looking AMOLED display. If the display type doesn't bother you much, then I would recommend waiting on the Vivoactive 5. If your main activity type is running, then a Forerunner is likely a better option. However, if you're like myself and your main sport is powerlifting or another, and/or you want a beautiful, sharp display on your watch coupled with great battery life, then this is for you."", 'Received the watch earlier than expected - great work, Amazon. The watch looks good, and the display - when it’s on - is pretty. However, that may be the extent of the upside. The problem is the ‘always on’ feature, which is what persuaded me to buy the Venu rather than the Vivoactive 4 (which is identical in function). I have had several Garmin watches, and I also have an Apple Watch 3. Despite its lovely display, the fact that it goes blank and you need to move your wrist to see it made it intolerable for me. The Vivoactive 3 I replaced it with has a less pretty display, but you can always see it - and its sports features are way ahead of anything you can get on the Apple Watch. So the Venu, with an ‘always on’ OLED display, should have combined the best of both, with some functional enhancements too. But the display is very uncooperative. It decides when it’s going to be on, and that often isn’t what you asked it to do! It may show the power-saving ‘always on’ face (basically just the time) for some of the time, but refuse to wake up and show the full display when you move it. Or it will just be blank. And resolutely stay blank until you hit it. Hard. No amount of playing with the screen settings has resolved this behaviour. I hope a firmware update will improve it (mine is on 3.4), but as yet I can’t recommend it.', 'Als die Venu angekündigt wurde wusste ich dass ich nicht wiederstehen konnte und von meiner Forerunner 645 Music umsteigen werde. Dank Vorbestellung von Amazon hatte ich sie schon vor Release und konnte sie schon gut testen.+Design: die Uhr wirkt sehr hochwertig, dezent und edel und kann sogar mit Silikonband zu schicken Outfits getragen werden. Die Verarbeitung lässt wirklich nicht zu wünschen übrig und sie lässt sich bequem den ganzen Tag tragen+Display: für mich die perfekte Größe und hier der erste deutliche Unterschied zur Forerunner: sehr schöne Farben, gestochen scharf und auch im Training immer gut ablesbar.Ich hatte etwas Bedenken wegen dem Touchscreen aber wurde überzeugt. Es lässt sich präzise navigieren, reagiert promt. Da Garmin ja ein sehr umfangreiches Menü hat, fällt es mir mit dem Touchscreen sogar deutlich leichter.+Training: für mich das wichtigste denn ich suchte keine SmartWatch mit Fitnessfunktion sondern eine LAUFuhr! Denn ich laufe 5mal Pro Woche im ambitionierten Marathontraining. Hier bietet bie Venu gleiches Potential wie die Forerunner mit einigen Verbesserungen.1. Das GPS findet deutlich schneller Signal2. Der Herzfrequenz Sensor ist sehr genau und reagiert schnell auf Änderung was für mich im Intervall Training sehr wichtig istDie Forerunner konnte ich hier nur mit Brustgurt verwenden, bei der Venu ist die Messung am Handgelenk so exakt dass ich den Gurt immer weniger benutze.+Akku: die Uhr kam mit gut 90% Akku an, ich habe sie nicht geladen und jetzt 4 Tage benutzt. Dabei war ich drei Mal trainieren und habe natürlich am Anfang viel an der Uhr gespielt. Aktuell haben ich noch 26% , die Akkuleistung scheint also sogar besser als von Garmin angegeben. Ganz klar ein Plus!Ich kann bisher nichts kritisieren. Der pulsoximeter ist nett, für mich aber eher eine kleine Spielerei. Die Funktion mit der Body Battery ist aber toll! Ich bin sehr zufrieden', ""I do a lot of running and wanted to be able to ditch my phone but still track my runs and listen to music. I did a lot of research before buying this watch and decided this was the best option. I got it for under £200.MUSIC: The built in Spotify app is a feature which the Apple Watch doesn't have. This is really useful and simple to sync music / podcasts (albeit note that Garmin / Spotify have a problem with syncing podcasts from BBC Sounds - I have taken this up with both of them and got a very disappointing response that they are not supported).ACTIVITIES: The Venu Sq tracks all activities. I use it to run and in the gym. It tracks my runs accurately and (once setup) links automatically to my strava. It tracks sets / reps relatively well in the gym automatically. You can amend the exercise / reps / weight in the Garmin Connect app after (although this does keep crashing when I amend the above which is annoying).PERFORMANCE: The touch screen is ok. I have always found Garmin a bit difficult to navigate. My father has a Forerunner and I struggle to use the buttons on that. But it's certainly no worse than any other Garmin.BUILD: I have scratched the side of the watch which is annoying. I have since bought a screen protector and that has helped avoid any scratches to the screen. But overall the build seems good. Put it to use; it doesn't matter if it gets a little scratched.OVERALL: Overall I'm really happy with the watch. It's great for what I wanted, i.e. to ditch my phone. I still think it's great to go out running with just my headphones and a key. The Apple Watch doesn't give you the links to Spotify. There are limited number of Garmin watches that do. This is the cheapest; but I think it does just as good a job at tracking activities as a Forerunner (not tried a Fenix)."", 'I bought this to replace my broken Fitbit charge 3. The data captured is much more useful for me to understand my body situation than my Fitbit. Charging it every day I take a shower, and it comes to 100% battery after that. Synchronization is fast and smooth (while my old charge 3 took a lot of time and sometimes not syncing for the whole day), the screen is clear to see, and the interface can be customised to very personal, friendly one.', ""I love a good watch.I think it's fair to say I've owned a large number of watches during my life, both standard and smart. Most smartwatches come with an array of functions, most of which are useless to me. I started getting smartwatches because I kept missing calls/texts and wanted something to help with that. The vibration motor on this watch is perfect for this; it's certainly not something you'll miss when you get called etc.Last year my wife suggested that I may be suffering from sleep apnea, so I decided to see what watches were around that could help prove that. It turns out that although there are a lot of watches out there with SPO2 functionality, the majority of them don't run a continuous trace, and instead just have an on-demand check. For someone looking to monitor sleep, this is useless. So I was down to just a few watches, and the price point meant that realistically it was down to this watch and the Fitbit Versa 3.I spent weeks researching the two watches, and was almost decided on the Versa; with a slightly larger screen and AMOLED at that, it seemed a no-brainer. Until I saw some posts on the Fitbit forums where everyone was complaining that to analyse SPO2 results required a monthly fee. All the posts contained people's wish they'd gone for this watch instead. My mind was made up.So here we are.There is a lot of functionality in this watch, most of which I've not used. It seems accurate enough in my step count and can tell me how far I've walked on the off-chance I've walked anywhere.The sleep monitoring is on a par with other watches but can give me not only the information about what type of sleep I've had at various points during the night, but also how many breaths per minute I'm managing, and of course the all-important SPO2 graph.The stress monitoring I'm not totally sure about; it shows I get very little stress during the night, but it can get quite high during the working day. I do have a stressful job, but it's not something I've really thought as affecting me in any negative way. Something to keep an eye on I guess.The app (android) gives you all the information you need about all functions offered and is very easy to understand (with information pages where needed).The screen is easy to read inside and outside - I've yet to try it outside on a sunny day, but we don't get many of those and aren't allowed outside anyway. It's small though, which is a small issue for me as I wear glasses for up-close work like reading and using computers, but don't wear them otherwise; making the watch hard to see. You can change the watch face, however, and with a large selection to choose from (and the option to make your own), there's certainly something for every eye strength.It'll be hard for me to pass judgement on the battery life; for my use, it lasts 6-8 days which is great, but I do very little exercise at the moment and appreciate that the battery life will be far less if I'm running all over the shop every day.Overall, I'm really happy with this watch; the only thing I'd change would be to have a larger screen.I might keep this one the longest."", 'Ich habe von einer Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music auf die Venu gewechselt.Für mich war das Mip Display der Vivoactive 3 Music optisch ein Graus, hat aber seine Arbeit bei allen Lichtverhältnissen anstandslos getan.Da ich meine Uhr 24h trage und auch gerne zu feierlichen Anlässen, kommt mir die Venu mit dem Amoled Display gerade recht.Das Menü der Venu ist etwas anders aufgebaut als bei der Vivoactive, aber dafür auch mit zwei Knöpfen zu bedienen.Ich denke ein Knopf hätte es hier auch getan.Habe die Uhr erst seit sechs Tagen in Gebrauch, musste sie aber auch erst zweimal laden.Dazu zählen 16h always on Display, ständiger Pulsmesser, gelegentliche Benachrichtigungen, 2,5h Indooraktivität ohne GPS sowie eine Outdooraktivität mit GPS.Das Armband der Vivoactive konnte ich wieder verwenden (20mm Stegbreite) und auch so macht die Uhr einen optisch schönen Eindruck.Sie liegt gut am Handgelenk und ist für ihr Format sehr leicht.Das Ladekabel ist mit der Vivoactive identisch.Im IQ Store findet man zur Zeit leider noch nicht so viele Watchfaces.Aber ich denke das legt sich bald.Als Umsteiger bin ich letztendlich vollkommen zufrieden, auch wenn ich bei der Ablesbarkeit in der prallen Sonne im Gegensatz zur Vivoactive Abstriche machen muss.', 'Possédant actuellement une Venu 2S et une Venu SQ je vous livre mon comparatif de ces 2 montres étonnantes.Points communs : les deux modèles tournent sous l\'OS propriétaire Garmin qui est intéressant car peu gourmand en ressources, ce qui garantit une autonomie de 5 à 8 jours en utilisation normale pour les 2 modèles. En revanche, l\'activation en continu de la fonction de lecture des musiques réduit l\'autonomie à un jour.Les deux modèles ont la même interface mais la présence de l\'écran AMOLED et une meilleure réactivité rendent l\'usage du modèle 2S bien plus agréable à l\'usage. Tous les capteurs classiques sont disponibles : GPS (+ GLONAS+ GALILEO), boussole, Oxymètre de pouls, Fréquence cardiaque, compteur de pas, etc. La 2S propose en plus un baromètre qu\'il faudra étalonner mais qui permettra de calculer notamment le nombre d\'étages parcourus en cours de journée.Principales différences :La Venu SQ est une montre à cadran rectangulaire et écran LCD. Elle existe en version basique ou en version ""musique"", cette dernière permettant de jouer des morceaux enregistrés ou en streaming vers un appareil Bluetooth sans passer par un smartphone. Aucune des deux montres ne dispose d\'un haut-parleur ou d\'un micro. Par contre elles sont équipées d\'un vibreur très efficace pour vous alerter.La finition est correcte mais les boutons en plastique et le bracelet font un peu ""cheap"". Mais, à moins de 200€, le tarif reste imbattable par rapport aux fonctionnalités proposées.La Venu 2S est une version plus évoluée qui inclut un écran rond AMOLED 1,2 pouce haute résolution, un cerclage en acier inoxydable, et des animations des exercices sur l\'écran. Ce modèle est non seulement plus qualitatif mais il est aussi plus réactif, donc je suppose que le processeur embarqué dans la 2S est plus puissant.Esthétiquement je trouve le modèle 2S beaucoup plus réussi et, malgré une taille identique de 40mm, il apparait plus discret et plus élégant sur un petit poignet.Capteurs de santé communes aux 2 montres :Une Venu/Venu2 se porte toute la journée et toute la nuit, de sorte que la montre affiche les scores de vos constantes physiques. Ceci ne pose aucun problème vu la légèreté et l\'autonomie des 2 appareils qui dépasse 5 jours sans problème. De plus ces deux modèles sont également étanches.Fréquence cardiaque : mesurée au poignet elle est très précise sur les 2 montres. Elle peut s\'afficher à la demande ou même apparaître en permanence sur l\'écran d\'accueil (le ""cadran de montre""). C\'est le même capteur pour les 2 appareils.Oxymètre de pouls : mesure le taux d\'oxygène sanguin. Cette mesure est sensible au mouvement ou à la position de la montre sur le poignet. Contrairement à d\'autres montres, on peut ici demander le calcul de la SpO2 à tout moment (ça prend une dizaine de secondes) sachant que l\'appareil peut l\'enregistrer à intervalle régulier pendant que vous dormez, ce qui peut être très utile si vous soupçonnez une apnée du sommeil.La Venu 2S bénéficie d\'un capteur plus récent que la SQ et j\'ai effectivement constaté des mesures plus précises pour la 2S par rapport à un capteur à l\'index que je possède par ailleurs et qui a été correctement étalonné.Respiration : il s’agit du nombre de respiration par minute. La donnée est mesurée en temps réel en permanence et participe au score de votre sommeil.Fonction de synthèse :L’aperçu santé donne un aperçu de votre état de santé général à un moment donné. Le score est basé sur plusieurs paramètres : fréquence Cardiaque (FC), variabilité de la FC, taux d\'oxygène sanguin, respiration et stress.Le moniteur d\'énergie donne votre « réserve » d\'énergie tout au long de la journée (échelle de 1 à 100). Un nombre plus élevé signifie que vous êtes prêt pour une activité ; un nombre plus faible signifie que votre réserve d\'énergie est déchargée et que vous avez besoin d\'une pause.Suivi du stress : c\'est un indicateur composite calculé à partir des efforts réalisés et des temps de repos. Tout est pris en compte y compris le nombre de pas ou le nombre d\'étages parcourus.Suivi de l\'hydratation et des calories : ces deux indicateurs demandent votre participation puisque la montre ne peut pas savoir ce que vous absorbez en liquide ou en calories. Par contre elle connait vos dépenses à partir des efforts réalisés et de vos paramètres physiques (âge, taille, poids). Ceci permet au final de savoir si vous êtes en excédent ou en déficit de calories ou d\'hydratation.Suivi du cycle menstruel : non testéSuivi de la respiration : mesurée en permanence et en temps réel. Je n\'ai aucune idée sur la méthode employée par ces appareils pour mesurer la respiration, mais les chiffres annoncés me semblent réalistes et viennent compléter les statistiques de suivi.Suivi du sommeil : les 2 montres sont capables de détecter quand vous vous couchez et quand vous dormez. Vous définissez un objectif pour l\'heure de coucher et l\'heure de réveil, et un score est calculé sur la base de la durée et de la qualité de votre sommeil, sachant que les 3 phases (léger, profond et paradoxal) sont détectées et suivies. L\'historique de votre taux d\'oxygène pendant le sommeil est également géré.Fonctions généralesActivité : Les montres Venu sont des montres de Fitness orientées vers le sport et la santé. De nombreuses activités sont gérées pour tous les types de sports, y compris la natation ou le ski. Une activité peut être déclenchée manuellement mais aussi automatiquement car la montre détecte vos mouvements et vos déplacements. Ainsi, si vous démarrez une balade, la montre le détecte et déclenchera le suivi de l’activité après un temps que vous définissez mais à partir du moment exact de votre départ. Elle détectera aussi toute interruption pendant votre marche et la décomptera de votre activité. Pour les activités en salle, la montre peut se connecter à différents capteurs extérieurs pour améliorer le suivi.Notifications du téléphone : vous pouvez décider via l\'application Garmin quelles notifications seront transmises à votre montre. La communication s\'effectue en Bluetooth et non en Wi-Fi ce qui signifie que la montre doit rester à proximité du téléphone.Suivi et réponses aux messages (SMS, WhatsApp...) : comme pour les notifications, votre montre et votre smartphone peuvent partager les messages et les réponses pour la plupart des applications de messagerie. La montre ne disposant pas d\'un clavier, on enregistre des réponses courtes (Oui, Non, Je te rappelle plus tard, etc.) que l\'on sélectionne avec une liste déroulante et que l\'on peut envoyer au correspondant sans passer par le téléphone.Livetrack : cette fonction permet d\'informer des proches sur sa position pendant une activité. La fonction peut se déclencher manuellement ou automatiquement lorsque la montre détecte le démarrage d\'une activité (course, marche, vélo, rando...).Alerte temps réel vers un proche : il est possible de définir jusqu’à trois contacts pouvant être alertés (par SMS et email) en cas d\'urgence en appuyant pendant 5 secondes sur le bouton supérieur de la montre.Musique : La Garmin SQ simple ne possède pas de lecteur intégré et peut juste piloter le lecteur de musique de votre smartphone via Bluetooth.En optant pour les modèles SQ ou 2S avec fonction musique, vous disposez de 8Go de mémoire pour stocker vos MP3 dans la montre, soit par transfert de fichiers via USB (mp3 à copier dans le dossier MUSIC de la montre) soit en utilisant l\'application Garmin. Il est sans doute possible de transférer des fichiers depuis le smartphone vers la montre en utilisant un câble OTG mais je ne peux le garantir.Les Venu 2S/SQ avec fonction musiques sont également capables d\'accéder à Internet via Wi-Fi et donc d\'utiliser les services de streaming, comme Deezer, Spotify ou Amazon Music. Il manque à l\'appel YouTube Music.Garmin Pay est disponible sur les 2 modèles et fonctionne parfaitement, si votre banque supporte le service. Un paiement s\'effectuera directement sans contact avec la montre à présenter sur le terminal de paiement, après introduction de votre code secret configurable au moment de l\'association du service avec votre carte de paiement.L’application Garmin doit obligatoirement être installée sur votre smartphone pour faire l’appairage et l’initialisation. Elle permet de faire le lien entre la montre et votre smartphone, soit pour le paramétrer, soit pour afficher des statistiques. L\'application est très bien conçue et je n\'ai eu absolument aucun problème pour l\'utiliser, y compris en synchro avec les 2 appareils en même temps.Cloud :Le site connect.garmin.com permet de gérer tous les appareils Garmin enregistrés et d\'accéder aux tableaux de bord détaillés de votre activité.La boutique ConnectIQ vous permet de télécharger des centaines d\'activités, widgets ou cadrans de montres, sachant que pour ces derniers, la plupart sont modifiables directement depuis la montre.L\'écosystème n\'est évidemment pas aussi étendu que Wear OS mais on trouve ce qu\'on veut, y compris des boussoles, des logiciels de navigation, etc. Et la plupart de ces applications sont gratuites.Conclusion :Un critère important pour une montre connectée est l\'autonomie, et de ce point de vue, les deux modèles sont très bons, avec entre 10 et 15% de batterie consommée par jour avec une activité d\'une heure utilisant le GPS. Vous pouvez vous contenter de recharger ces montres une fois par semaine.Autre critère important, la précision du GPS. Et là encore c\'est très bon avec quasiment aucune déviation avec un GPS de smartphone.Au final, à moins de 200€ la Venu SQ est une super affaire pour celui qui veut s\'initier à l\'usage d\'une montre de fitness connectée. Avec la 2S on est clairement sur un modèle beaucoup plus élégant et qualitatif, qui conviendra mieux aux petits poignets. Pour ma part j’opte pour la 2S couleur gris clair et cerclage acier que vous voyez sur les photos.', ""Ok hardware, but software makes very poor use of the new high-resolution AMOLED display.The Venu seems rushed to market to me. It has a nice, bright high resolution display. However, other than a handful of pretty (but mostly featureless) watch faces, the Garmin software makes absolutely no use of the display. Most of the UI and many of the watch faces look pixelated and rough. Whilst Garmin get away with this on the MIP display used on their other always-on smartwatches - the higher resolution display of the Venu just exposes how bad the UI is. If you are expecting the Venu to be a polished version of the Vivoactive you will be very disappointed. This is no Apple/Samsung watch competitor.Added to this, in my copy of the watch, the touch screen display was often unresponsive. It was so bad at recognising left/right swipes that I found it almost impossible to change watch faces.As-is I can't recommend the Venu - the software just isn't fit for purpose. Which is a shame."", '(Unten sind 2 Update)Aktuell trage ich, zum Vergleichen, mal eine 120€ Huawei Watch GT active und die neue Garmin Venu.Ich habe mich wie Sau auf die Garmin gefreut, bin aber auf dem Boden der Tatsachen angelangt. Aber von vorne.Vor Jahren trug ich eine Forerunner 235 und war sehr zufrieden. Dann machte ich den Fehler eine Vivoactive 3 zu kaufen. Nachdem ich diese zurückgegeben habe bin ich über Samsung und Amazfit bei der Huawei Watch GT gelandet (auch bei Amaz. gekauft). Nach der Ankündigung der Venu konnte ich es kaum erwarten endlich wieder ein gutes Device zu haben. Zudem, und das sollte man nicht unerwähnt lassen, ist das Garmin Webfrontend wirklich gut.350€ will Garmin für diese überaus leichte Uhr. Die Leichtigkeit hat mich positiv überrascht.Bis heute kann die Garmin-App unter Android scheinbar keine Widgets. Ansonsten ist sie sehr aufschlussreich und detailliert. Als Beispiel im Anhang ein Screenshot des Dashboards. Um kurz vor 10 der letzte Sync um 05:50, autoamtisch wird bei mir nichts gesynct. So machen dann natürlich Widgets auch keinen Sinn.Ich hab dann gleich mal nen Track ausprobiert. Einen Ausschnitt sieht man im angehängten Bild. Die Huawei trackt diesen Gang genau so blöd. Also quer über die Straße und dergleichen. Ich bin natürlich straight gegangen. Herzfrequenz und Co stimmen halbwegs überein. Zumindest gibt es kein Device welches sich jetzt irgendwie besonders auffällig anders verhält. Wo hier 350€ zu verantworten sind? Mir ist das nicht ganz klar.SchlaftrackerHier sind die Daten durchaus unterschiedlich. Aber das liegt an den unterschiedlichen Logiken mit denen die Firmen auswerten. Fair Deal und nachvollziehbarABER: Garmin schafft es auch mit dem neuen Device nicht Nickerchen zu erfassen. Die Huawei macht das mit traumtänzerischer Sicherheit. Zudem MUSS ich, wenn ich das alles richtig sehe, noch immer ""Nicht stören"" Zeiten einrichten an die sich die Garmin hält. Bei der Huawei wird dies aufgrund der guten Schlaferkennung überflüssig.Der Blutsauerstoffsensor hält sich exakt an die eingestellte Zeit die man angeben muss um zu definieren wann man ungefähr schläft (wenn man den Sensor nicht ganztägig aktiv lässt, ist aber überflüssig). Das wiederum bedeutet das ich in der Woche um 5 aufstehe - am Wochenende aber bis 9 schlafe. Somit trackt der Oximeter Sensor NUR von 21:30 bis 5 Uhr.Klar, ich könnte das erweitern. Ich frage mich aber wo Garmin die Entwicklung verpasst hat wenn Huawei das mit seiner 120€ Watch GT Active (nicht Watch GT 2) problemlos kann.Das Display.Ist absolut einwadfrei. Als negativ Beispiel sei hier die Amazfit Verge genannt. Die hat selbst im hellsten Modus kaum die Sonne ausgehalten.Allerdings ist das Display der Venu durch den Klarlackplastikring (wie bei der Vivoative 3 Music) künstlich klein gehalten. Es geht aber noch und ist soweit OK. Gefühlt ist kaum eines der Watchfaces die man im Hauseigenen Store (kostenlos) anbietet wirklich angepasst.Das Design:Ist schon OK. Wenn ich die Watch GT sehe wirklich diese einfach etwas maskuliner, erwachsener und ""stärker"".Was mir so gar nicht gefällt ist der Umgang seitens Garmin mit den Kunden. Man betreibt ein eigenes Forum, liest aber (nach Supportaussagen) dort gar nicht mit. Kümmert sich gar nicht drum. Die Venu scheint ein ziemlich problematischer Launch zu sein. Firmware 3.50 ist derzeit 3 Wochen alt und im Venu/Vivoactive 4 Forum häufen sich Probleme. Die VA4 und die Venu sind, bis auf das Display, identisch.Bitte nicht falsch verstehen. Die Huawei hat genügend Schwächen. Aber die kostet auch kein kleines Vermögen.Aktuell sehe ich keinerlei Grund bei der Venu zu bleiben. Das großartige Webfrontend wäre tatsächlich der einzige Grund dazu. Ich werde noch eine FW abwarten und sehen welche Änderungen Garmin denn nach X Wochen doch dem Kunden noch an die Hand gibt. Ansonsten geht die Venu weinenden Auges zurück. Applepreise mit dieser Qualität bin ich nicht bereit zu zahlen. Alleine das der GPS Sensor so ungenau wie der von Huawei ist enttäuscht mich massiv.Ich frage mich da schon ob veraltetet strukturen und ""festhalten an bekannten Dingen"" dazu führt das es scheinbar im Softwarebereich so wenig Fortschritte gibt. Schlaftracker? Naps? Widgets? Auto-Sync der Daten von der Uhr zum Handy? Alles Teufelszeug oder so gewünscht? wenn ""Gewünscht"", vom wem? Zu alten Entwicklern oder Firmenentscheidern?------------------------------------------------------------------------>>--->> Update vom 15.11.2019Die Venu geht zurück. Sehr sehr schweren Herzens muss ich mir eingestehen das es so keinen Sinn macht. Ich werde Garmin und die Uhr vermissen.Stresslevel/Body Battery.:Garmin ist scheinbar nicht in der Lage Nickerchen zu erkennen. Das macht die ""Body Battery"" zum Witz. Ich würde erwarten das sich meine Batterie aufüllt wenn ich mich mal ausruhe. Nix da. Geht weiter runter. Parallel füllt sie sich auf wenn ich im Stau stehe und mich ärgere.Schlaftracker:Kaputt wie eh und je. Ich hab, nach der VA3 2018, ein paar Dinge ausprobiert. Samsung, Amazfit, Huawei usw und sogar diese seltsame Nokia Matratze. Sobald ich ein Garmindevice um tue sind meine Shclafwerte komplett im Eimer. Tiefschlaf? Mit viel Glück mal 30 Minuten, eher weniger. Der starre SPOx Sensor, der (scheinbar) nicht OnDemand gestartet werden kann misst in der Regel ~5% weniger als ein 20€ Fingersensor.GPS Tracker:Im letzten Bild (ich weiß das die Auf Amazon zu klein und unscharf sind) ist als Beispiel ein Walk zu sehen. Einmal die Strasse hoch und wieder runter. Natürlich MIT Jacke, wir haben Herbst.Genau das macht meine 120€ Watch GT ebenso mies, oder gut.....der kann ich das verzeihen. Einer 370€ Garmin Venu eher nichtFür mich ist hier Ende. Ich sehe mich nicht in der Lage das weiter zu unterstützen. Die 3.60 FW, die gestern kam, verbessert dahingehen auch nichts. Wenn Garmin den Betastest an den Käufern zu Applepreise durchziehen will? Bitteschön. Sollte die Venu mal unter 250€ fallen bin ich wieder dabei. Ich muss halt leider selber kaufen.------------------Update 18.11.2019Sucht man sich in einem Videoportal das Vergleichsvideo von Pocketnavigation zur Fenix 6 so sieht man sehr schnell wie ungenau der GPS Chip ist. Das ist quasi das gleich wie bei dem einfachen Track von mir festgestellt. Da ist so viel daneben.', ""I've previously owned the Vivoactive 3. When the Vivoactive 4 came along I had no doubt whatsoever that I was going to get it.Then I discovered the Venu which was marketed as a Vivoactive 4 with a better screen.The one (tiny) gripe I always had with my V3 was that the screen colours were not very good and quite flat (even though it's very good in bright light).The Venu changed all that. Very deep colours on a 390 x 390 AMOLED display (vs the 240 x 240 on the V3).The watch has a great number of features and options, but most of them will be familiar to Garmin users. The Body Battery is a neat feature, as is the Pulse Ox, even though I haven't had the chance to test this thoroughly yet.I find the device quite responsive and the battery life (so far) seems very decent.The Venu is very light but looks and feels like a premium product.One difference with the V3 (in the V3's favour) is that the Venu is doesn't have an 'always on' feature, i.e. you have to double tap the screen or press the top button to view. Not an issue though and I can see why they've done that as it would be a huge drain on the battery.All in all I'm very happy with my purchase. There have already been several software updates and I'm sure there will be more going forward to dial in this new product.If functionality comes first and display quality is less of a consideration, go for the Vivoactive 4. If you want the functionality and also enjoy a great display, go for the Venu."", 'Okay, da ist sie. Man was war ich scharf auf das Teil. Aber leider ist nun, weitgehend, Ernüchterung eingekehrt.Zunächst zu mir: meine erste SmartWatch war eine Garmin, danach kamen diverse andere Modelle,ua. von Fitbit, Mobvoi Ticwatch und Huawei.Schon damals war die Garmin irgendwie umständlich, bzw. unlogisch zu bedienen. Irgendwie finde ich keine klare Linie auf dem Weg durch die Menüs. Das hat sich leider in meinem Augen noch verschlimmbessert.Die dazugehörige App(s) sind etwas besser, aber meiner Meinung nach immer noch schlechter als die anderen Hersteller.Es dauert sowohl auf der Uhr, als auch in den Apps etwas länger, sich zurecht zu finden.Zur Hardware: ich wusste, dass ich hier kein Schmuckstück bekomme, dafür steht Garmin einfach nicht. Ist halt ein Plastikbomber, aber der ist gut verarbeitet, kann man tragen.Die Datenerfassung scheint recht gut zu sein, aber das muss ich noch ein paar Tage beobachten, bis ich mir hier eine endgültige Meinung bilden kann.Ich werde diese Rezension weiter aktuell halten und berichten, ob das Dingen hier bleibt, oder zurück gehen muss.Wie gesagt, aufgrund der unnötig umständlichen Software bin ich immo noch sehr enttäuscht.Update 2.9.:Ich mag sie .., irgendwie. Bildschirm ist toll, sie ist gut zu tragen!Aber das Teil nervt.Zum Beispiel Schlaferfassung: geht quasi nur zu den vorher eingestellten Zeiten, von selbst merkt dass Teil nichts. Morgens muss man der Uhr sogar sagen, das man wach ist. Kann zB. Huawei deutlich besser.Beispiel Training: Habe mir über die App zwei Krafttrainings ausgesucht und auf die Uhr übertragen lassen. Glaubt mal nicht, dass die dort irgendwo zu finden sind.Überhaupt: die Bedienung ist dermaßen unlogisch, warum macht man das nicht so aufgeräumt und logisch wie die Mitbewerber?Okay, ich überlege noch 2 Tage, tendiere aber stark dazu, sie zurück zu geben! Schade Garmin...Update 12.10.Tja, da ich immer noch hin und her gerissen war, habe ich Depp den Rückgabezeitpunkt verpasst. Selbst schuld.Eigentlich hat sich für mich nichts verändert, ist ne Art Hassliebe geblieben. Garmin hat leider noch keine, für mich entscheidende, Updates gebracht. Werden sie wohl auch nicht mehr, ist scheinbar Firmenpolitik, die Benutzer mit Software, sowohl in der App als auch auf der Uhr, ohne Sinn und Verstand zu ärgern.Warum z.B. ist der untere Bedienbutton nicht mit einer Funktion belegbar? Oder bin ich zu blöd, das zu finden...???Außer der Schlafüberwachung (wieso lebe ich eigentlich noch?) überzeugen mich jedenfalls die Messwerte. Der GPS-Fix dauert in der Regel leider sehr lang. Die angegebene Akkulaufzeit stimmt ungefähr.Garmin, da wäre so viel mehr drin gewesen!', 'Pros:- Sieht ganz gut aus- Heart-Rate tracking sehr akkurat- Gutes GPS trackingCons *Tief Luft hohl*:- Physische KnöpfeDiese sind rechts was beim tragen von Wrist Wraps/Straps beim Bodybuilding/Krafttraining zu versehentlichen auslösen führt. Das ist super nervig- Sleep TrackingEinschlaf, Aufsteht und Wachzeiten sind zwar ziemlich gut, das war es aber auch schon.Vorallem die Tief, Leicht und REM Schlafphasen sind jenseits von gut und Böße. Pro nacht habe ich nur eine Tiefschlafphase welche nahezu direkt nach dem einschlafen liegt und zwischen 10 und 30 minuten liegt, das wars.Bei review videos auf youtube habe ich nahezu identische aufnahmen gesehen.Das wirkt fast so als würde Garmin zufällige werte wählen und diese nach einem gewissen schema anzeigenHierbei handelt es sich jedoch nur um Vermutungen. Ob die Daten vll. doch korrekt sind kann ich leider nicht 100% sagen.Koffein konsumieren ich ggf. 8 std. vorm schlafen gehen das letzte mal (12 mittag) und oftmals (Wochenende) sogar ca. 12 std. zuvor. Darn kann es also nicht liegen.Auch trotz Schlaftabletten (das erste mal das ich welche genommen habe, heißt ich konnte noch keine Toleranz bilden) haben sie die werte nicht verändert.- Automatisches starten von Gehen/LaufenDa ich kein Läufer bin habe ich nur gehen ""verwendet"". Als Hundebesitzer bin ich hier öfter draußen und das automatische starten funktioniert einfach gar nicht.Initial habe ich etwa 20-30km (über mehrere Tage) manuell getracked und dann das automatische tracking angeschalten.Dieses startet entweder gar nicht oder nachdem ich bereits wieder zurück bin und gerade durch die Haustürewieder rein gehe.- VibrationSelbst auf niedrig ist es noch fast zu viel wobei das größere problem die dauer der vibration ist.Je nach gewähltem training löst der untere Knopf eine bestimmte Aktion aus (Gehen/Laufen = Neue Runde, Krafttraining = Neues Set).Hier vibriert die Uhr dann für gefühlt 2 Sekunden. Das mag nach einer Kleinlichkeit klingen aber treibt mich in den Wahnsinn.- Rep-Counting bei ""Kraftsport""Liegt einfach immer gewaltig daneben und das obwohl ich meine Übungen sehr bewusst und kontrolliert durchführe.Da mich aber hauptsächlich Herzfrequenz interessiert (da ich Übung/Sets/Reps anderweitig pflege) würde ich dieses feature einfach ausschalten......wenn das denn möglich wäre- App (Android)Auch wenn diese so ziemlich alles anzeigt was man benötigt ist diese ein absolutes Chaos und benötigt ein dringendes Redesign am besten auf Basis der Material Guidelines.Das ist aber das kleinste Mako und vertretbar wenn man sich ein-/zweimal intensiver mit der app beschäftigt.- ArmbandHier handelt es sich um ein ziemliches Standard Armband und das nervt. An und Ablegen der Uhr dauert mir einfach viel zu lange und die Schlaufe, wo man das ende des Armbands einfädelt, ist sehr schwer verschiebbar.Hat man die Uhr nun schon 50% angelegt und merkt das diese Schlaufe falsch positioniert ist, heißt es entweder wie ein blöder ""reisen"" um es zu verschieben oder die Uhr nochmal abnehmen.Wieder eine Kleinigkeit aber trotzdem nervig.Wenigstens eine Sache die man mit 3rd-Party Armbändern lösen könnte- ChargingKudos an Garmin dafür das sie scheinbar immer den gleichen Ladestecker verwenden und nicht wie bsp. Fitbit mit jeder version einen neuen raus bringen.Nichts desto trotz würde ich mir hier wireless charging wünschen auch wenn die Uhr sehr schnell über Kabel lädt.Auch wieder eine Kleinigkeit über die man hinweg sehen kann.Fazit:Da für mich Sleep-Tracking genau so wichtig ist wie das tracking von Training oder sogar noch mehr da Recovery extrem wichtig ist und ich wissen muss wen mein Schlaf WIRKLICH schlecht war um den vortag zu reflektieren und ggf. Anpassungen zu machen, muss ich mich von Garmin leider verabschieden.Sleep-Tracking ist wohl noch nie eine Stärke von Garmin gewesen und auch wenn Sie einen Blog-Post haben der darüber Spricht das es ziemlich Akkurat sein soll kann ich das einfach nicht glauben.', ""I've had my watch for a few months now and I would now feel naked without it. I didn't wear a watch before so it took some getting used to. Firstly having something on your wrist and then the fact that you can shower with it on as well. It's so easy to use and lightweight.  I only charge the battery once a week which is great and it charges really quickly so I only have to be without it for less than an hour. It's really helped with tracking my activity levels, my calories, my steps but one of the features I love the most is the body battery.  It is so useful to know when I need to slow down, get more sleep and maybe skip the gin and tonic in order to get to 100% the next day. I don't think I could be without this watch now. It's the first smart watch I've had and I love it! No buyers remorse at all!!"", ""<><><><><>𝙍𝙚𝙘𝙚𝙣𝙨𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙗𝙧𝙚𝙫𝙚<><><><><>Questo smart/sport-watch⌚️ della Garmin è un'ottima alternativa ai vari Amazfit e company se si vuole un orologio di media gamma che offre tutto allo sportivo amatoriale e perché no anche agli sportivi più seri.Design molto gradevole, di solito me lo scambiano per un (ben più costoso) Apple Watch, le funzioni che offre sono davvero tante: quasi ogni sport, pulseOx, analisi del livello di stress con conseguente suggermineto di esercizi di respirazione e tanto altro tutto visibile sulla pagina di presentazione del prodotto.Parlandovi dell'utilizzo giornaliero: ti scordi di averlo al polso, leggerissimo, unica nota dolente (se proprio vogliamo) è la batteria che siu consuma più velocemente di quanto promesso.Sinceramente a me non cambia molto perché avendo momenti morti durante la giornata mi è possibile caricarlo.Se volete saperne di più la recensione continua sotto! Buona giornata e spero abbiate Utile il mio parere!<><><><><>𝙍𝙚𝙘𝙚𝙣𝙨𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙚𝙩𝙖<><><><><>ESPERIENZA PERSONALE: Dopo averci pensato davvero tanto ho iniziato a mettere da parte dei soldi ogni qualvolta andavo a correre per sostituire il mio amatissimo Amazfit Bip, dopo 2 anni poverino ha iniziato a cedere; non mentirò: Garmin è stata la mia prima scelta come sinonimo di qualità dei sensori e serietà dell'azienda.La mia prima scelta era il Vivoactive 4 ma trovavo il prezzo proibitivo (mi rendo conto che siano 50€ in più ad oggi) quindi ho continuato ad aspettare che andasse in sconto, poi lui ... neanche a farlo apposta esce questo meraviglioso Venu SQ Music con un form a me più affine (la forma quadrata) e tutti i sensori che volevo (è assente il barometro ma serve a ben poco a me personalmente).L'applicazione non è subito immediata ma devo dire che la trovo graficamente molto gradevole e completa (basta perderci un po' di tempo nel cercare di capirla).L'orologio ha un software molto immediato su di esso e la possibiltà di cambiare la watchface apre un mondo di porte per non stancarti mai del tuo look.Ovviamente non ho potuto testare ogni sua funzione, queste sono quelle che ho provato:- 🏃\u200d♂️Camminata/Corsa all'aperto🏃\u200d♂️: gps preciso e battiti conformi vicini a quelli misurati con una fascia cardio di fascia media- 🚶\u200d♂️Camminata su tapis roulant🚶\u200d♂️: chilometri errati di circa 100 m ma sinceramente non so nemmeno come faccia a calcolare con precisione una cosa del genere! In ogni caso meglio attenersi al proprio tapis!- 🏊\u200d♂️Nuoto🏊\u200d♂️: Sono decisamente un amatore in questo campo, posso solo dirvi che tiene il conto correttamente delle vasche- 💨Esercizi di respirazione💨: piacevoli, durata a scelta e devo dire che li ho trovati abbastanza rilassanti- 🎶Musica🎶: lato musica perfetto, personalmente non ho avuto nessun problema a configurare le playlist, Spotify comodissimo e ha individuato le mie cuffie bluetooth in un attimo. Finalmente posso andare a correre senza il fastidio di dover tenere il telefono in tasca/mano/attaccato al braccio!- 💳GarminPay💳: non c'è molto da dire, funziona perfettamente!Lo ricomprerei senza alcun dubbio!TARGET: Volete avere qualche dato in più sulla vostra attività fisica? Volete avere uno smartwatch carino a vedersi senza spendere 500€? Allora questo è l'orologio che fa per voiCONTRO: Solo la batteria che si scarica in fretta ma devo ammettere che si carica anche piuttosto velocemente quindi 1 oretta in cui state alla scrivania lo potete attaccare e trovarlo al 100%, a me dura circa 3 giorni ma non lo faccio mai arrivare allo 0%"", 'ca fait maintenant 1 semaine que j\'ai cette nouvelle Garmin et j\'ai essayé aussi la VIVOACTIVE 4 juste avant pendant une semaine aussi.au premier coup d’œil, l’écran de la VENU n\'a rien a voir...a coté, la Vivo4 est fade et sans profondeur de couleur.les fonctions sont les meme et le cercle de la montre est plus grand sur la Vivo4 (45 cm contre 43 sur la Venu)Pour moi qui ai un petit poignet, ca compte...Le bracelet aussi est plus petit, 22 mm contre 20 sur la Venu.bien sur, un bel écran comme ca a des défauts notamment sa consommation: je tiens environ 3 jours (etteinte la nuit) en mode ""connecté"". c\'est a dire que la montre est couplée au TPH et les notifications s\'affiche sur la Venu.A noter que je suis aussi en mode always on: l’écran affiche en mode minimaliste l\'heure tout le temps et affiches les autres paramètres quand je tourne mon poignet. ca consomme plus mais je trouve ca plus fun.Avec la vivo4, je tenais 4 jours dans le meme mode. enfin pas tout a fait car l\'always on n\'existe pas mais les pixels sont toujours presents mais non eclairés par le retro éclairage.j\'ai aussi pris un bracelet cuir non Garmin.Il est bien pour tous les jours meme s\'il se détache de temps en temps quand la montre est un peu stressée (quand le poignet bouge fortement et déplace la montre). je pense que le système d’accroche rapide est un poil trop petit et la tension créée a ce moment la fait sauter le bracelet.Il n\'y a pas ce problème avec le bracelet plastique d\'origine.', 'Good features:Screen - the standout feature and the main reason to go for this watch rather than any other Garmin offeringsBattery life - surprisingly good (4-5 days continuous use without always on display) and in any case it charges up really quicklyGPS tracking - rock solid and finds signal very quickly.  It probably gives you at least 10 hours without music.Appearance - looks very goodMobile app - excellent for data vultures like meConnectivity - no problem staying connected to my smartphoneWeight - very light and comfortable to wearActivity tracking - all aspects work well, including plausible step and floor countingPulse Ox tracking - not sure what the point is but it is a lot of funNot so good featuresSleep tracking - doesn\'t do a good job, as it thinks you are sleeping all the time you are in bed.  However, this is common to all Garmin devices.  The Fitbit does a much better job here. This means that the body battery reading which is based partly on sleep data is highly suspect tooNotifications - OK but doesn\'t display icons consistently and there\'s not much possibility of interaction. The Fitbit does a better job hereNo microphone or speaker - Personally I don\'t care but it might be an issue for someScreen bezel a tad on the large side though not noticeable if watch face with dark background selectedPrice - high but you are getting a very good watch for your moneyI\'ve owned many smart and not so smart watches, including Garmin, Pebble, Huawei, Samsung, TicWatch and Fitbit offerings. This is the best one I\'ve owned.  In my opinion, for what it\'s worth, the good massively outweighs the not so good and therefore 5 stars is justified.Possible (cheaper) alternatives:Fitbit Versa 2 - also very good display and sleep tracking is excellent. Notification handling much better. Steps tracking is appalling though and it only has ""connected GPS"". There are also many connectivity problems.Huawei GT Watch 2 - phenomenal battery life and good display but notifications handling is even worse than Garmin, sleep tracking is also suspect and, although workout tracking with GPS is excellent, it cannot be shared with Strava.Garmin Vivoactive 4 - almost the same as the Venu but with transflective (i.e. always on) display and it\'s a bit cheaper.', ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Da parecchi anni ho smartwatch Garmin al polso, soprattutto i modelli Vivoactive che acquisto fin dalla seconda versione. Questa volta volevo provare il tanto decantato schermo amoled del Venu.Lo smartwatch arriva al 100% della carica, quindi ci si può dimenticare della fase di full-charge iniziale perché è già tutto pronto.La configurazione è pressoché immediata se si dispone già di un account Garmin e dell'app Connect installata.In questo caso viene anche proposta la fase di sincronizzazione dei dati (informazioni anagrafiche, attività, obiettivi, etc...).Rispetto a Vivoactive si può scorrere tutte le informazioni in un'unica schermata, mentre sul Vivoactive ogni funzionalità occupava tutto il quadrante. Non sono sicuro di apprezzare questa organizzazione ma usando l'orologio mi ci abituerò in qualche modo.L'interazione con l'interfaccia è molto fluida tranne nel passaggio tra un quadrante e l'altro, quando si seleziona il prescelto tra le opzioni disponibili: poco male.Una delusione sono i quadranti disponibili di default: sono davvero pochi e non particolarmente interessanti visivamente anche se ovviamente si può attingere allo store di Garmin. Oltre a questo,  i campi dei quadranti non possono essere editati.L'editor parte invece da un quadrante vuoto al quale aggiungere tutte le varie componenti: dati, lancette, sfondo e così via.Mi sono bloccato inizialmente nella prima sincronizzazione con Garmin Connect perché dopo qualche secondo si interrompeva andando in errore. Il motivo dell'errote era che ildisplay del telefono android andava in standby dopo 15 secondo e questo bloccava la sincronizzazione.La soluzione è tenere il display sempre attivo per 15-20 minuti in modo che la procedura si chiuda senza intoppi.Il punto debole di questo smartwatch, come riportato anche i molti siti specializzati è il fatto che la durata della batteria è veramente bassa con il display always-on. Si può però utilizzare il l'orologio in modalità Vivoactive:  col display sempre attivo ma con i gest disattivati.In questo modo il quadrante sempre attivo in modalità molto soft e in risparmio energetico.Il cinturino ed il quadrante (quello fisico) sono ottimi, eredità del modello precedente.In generale il mio consiglio personale è quello di aspettare il Vivoactive 5 perché lo schermo amoled non giustifica una durata della batteria così bassa ed un prezzo così elevato.Dopo anni di evoluzione degli smartwatch, dover ancora fare mille trucchetti per risparmiare batteria sa tanto di amarcord degli anni '90-2000 quando la tecnologia c'era ma era ancora molto acerba."", 'Generally a good all round product. Only discovering half of what this watch can actually do.  Everything apart from the sleep cycle is reasonably accurate. And works incredibly well under waterHowever my biggest gripe is the materials used to make the watch. Both the screen and watch surround are showing more scratches and general  wear after several months than my old apple watch series 1 did after several years, which is unacceptable for a premium product.', ""I deeply regret buying this. The battery life is so short so a day's readings can never be accurate and unless you display the heart rate on the watch face (which uses even more battery) you can't even see the reading whilst exercising. This is bad for older people who need to make sure their heart rate is not being exceeded on something like a treadmill - the watch face just goes blank after seconds and the touch screen often does not respond. For such an expensive item I found the cheap plastic wrist strap hard on my wrist and to even get a reading it has to be worn quite tightly which causes discomfort. I would return it for a refund but stupidly threw the box away before really testing the product properly - I assumed it would live up to all the hype."", 'Had this watch for a week. Brought as update for vio fit. The only thing better on this watch is the display so paid 350 for a screen upgrade.Battery life about 3 days if you use GPS a lot which I do for running and other activities.

The app store is effectively useless with this watch.Because of this and limited pre loaded apps this not a smart watch. You can get a fitness tracker that will do all this for £50 with a good display I am seriously considering returning as not fit for described purpose 😡😡', 'Fratello minore del Venu tondo, perde delle funzioni a mio avviso superflue per chi vuole la sostanza, nonché lo schermo amoled a favore di un LCD, ma c\'è differenza nell\'uso quotidiano? NO, il primo ha sicuramente un impatto visivo maggiore, ma il secondo è ben più che visibile e definito. Perde il barometro questo fattore è soggettivo se utile o meno, come lo è il fatto di non essere completamente in acciaio inossidabile, questo significa che è delicato? NO, al tatto si percepisce la solidità. Il touch risponde molto bene al tocco in linea generale. Non c\'è lo schermo sempre acceso, indispensabile? NO se l\'orologio ha un buon sensore del movimento, e questo ce l\'ha. Per il resto la sensoristica è la medesima, qualità Garmin quale non ha bisogno di descrizione. Il GPS è rapido nella recezione del segnale, le notifiche arrivano puntuali ed è facile rispondere(al momento nei gruppi WhatsApp NON si può rispondere). L\'estetica è soggettiva ma, a mio avviso, sembra che l\'azienda non l\'abbia affatto trascurata. Traendo le conclusioni, un ottimo sportwatch con funzioni smart, al polso è leggerissimo, ottimo anche per chi si approccia per la prima volta in questo mondo, l\'azienda ha voluto alleggerire su quello che poteva pensando più alla praticità che alla forma, questo lo porta ad avere un prezzo \'leggero\' per le potenzialità offerteAGGIORNAMENTOdopo 3 mesi di utilizzo ci sono stati diversi aggiornamenti, tra cui la possibilità di rispondere sui gruppi Whatsapp vedendo chi ha scritto cosa, è migliorata l\'usabilità generale, ma una cosa che ancora mi ""pesa"" è la scarsa adesione con le banche per GarminPay. Al di là di questo neo, ad oggi sono ancora soddisfatto dell\'acquisto', 'Ich habe relativ lange nach einer für mich passenden Smartwatch gesucht. Das bedeutet für mich: Eindeutiger Fokus auf Sport und Gesundheit, ansprechendes Design und nicht ""nur ein Fitnessarmband, ein Akku der mehrere Tage durchhält und ein ordentliches Display. Mit der Venu hatte ich den perfekten Fit gefunden - dachte ich zumindest.Für mich konnte ich eindeutige Stärken und Schwächen feststellen. Die möchte ich nun einmal in Bereiche unterteilen.==================Design & Tragekomfort==================Natürlich ein sehr subjektiver Punkt. Ich finde die Uhr optisch sehr ansprechend. Auch den Tragekomfort fand ich sehr angenehm, was für eine Uhr, die man auch beim Schlafen trägt durchaus wichtig ist. Teilweise kritisiert wurde, dass die Uhr zu großen Teilen aus Plastik ist. Das stimmt und bei rund 380€ kann ich die Kritik teilweise nachvollziehen. Wenn jedoch bedacht wird, dass die Uhr eine Sport-/Allrounderuhr ist, finde ich die Prioritäten gut gesetzt. Den Punkt Design & Tragekomfort würde ich als klare Stärke einordnen.=======Akku=======Der Akku ist auf jeden Fall ein Punkt, bei dem diese Uhr der Konkurrenz voraus ist. Allerdings zehrt auch jede kleine Einstellung am Akku. Niemand stellt die Uhr auf die dunkelste Helligkeitsstufe und deaktiviert fast alle Features. Display etwas heller gestellt -> Akku runter, Auto-Synchronisation -> Akku runter, SpO2 Sensor nicht dauerhaft aus -> Akku runter. Von den beworbenen 5 Tagen bleiben realistisch ca. 3 Tage. Mit nachts aktiven SpO2-Sensor, 5 Aktivitäten pro Woche und 3/4-Displayhelligkeit geht es auf ca. 2 bis 2,5 Tage runter. Ich würde den Punkt als kleine Stärke sehen. Man hätte die Marketing-Keule aber etwas realistischer ansetzen können.=========Funktionen=========Insgesamt wie gesagt ein Sportallrounder. Die Features sind hauptsächlich Sportfokussiert mit kleineren, alltagstauglichen Smartwatch-Funktionen. Einiges ist jedoch eher Spielerei. Der SpO2-Sensor ist z.B. nicht so in der App implementiert, dass er spürbaren Nutzen bringt. Als bisher non-Garmin-Nutzer fand ich auch die Body Battery Funktion sehr spannend. Auch die hat sich für mich persönlich jedoch eher als Spielerei entpuppt. Mit den Funktionen war ich insgesamt zufrieden. Die Aktivitätsaufzeichnung ist gut und detailliert. Was ich mir gewünscht hätte, ist eine Verarbeitung der Details zu einem Score, ähnlich wie es Fitbit macht. Da bin ich mir nicht sicher, ob ich stets zu blind war das zu finden oder ob es keine simple Zusammenfassung gibt.Insgesamt für mich ein solider Punkt, allerdings nichts, was die Uhr ausmacht.=========Sensoren=========Dieser Punkt ist in meinem Fall die absolute Achillessehne der Uhr. Den mäßig sinnvollen SpO2-Sensor habe ich bereits erwähnt. Allerdings sind auch restliche Messungen bei meiner Uhr absolut Katastrophal gewesen. D.h. die Uhr hatte eine sehr seltsame Interpretation meines Schlafes. Oft soll ich schon um 19:00 Uhr eingeschlafen sein. War ich um 02:30 Uhr wach, war das egal. Je nachdem habe ich dort angeblich leicht oder in der REM-Phase geschlafen. Das hat sich dazu entwickelt, dass nicht die Uhr meinen Schlaf, sondern ich die Uhr überwacht habe. Treppen wurden inkorrekt gezählt. Ich habe mich einen Tag nur im Haus bewegt. Sprich jede Treppe nach oben = Treppe nach unten. Gemessen: 16 Treppen hoch, 22 runter. Beim Stress war ich bei einer anstrengend Innenstadt-Autofahrt absolut tiefenentspannt, aber beim Abend vorm Fernseher war ich wohl panisch gestresst. Bei bisherigen Fitnessuhren hatte ich einen Ruhepuls von 49-53. Damals habe ich noch mehr Sport gemacht. Trotz heute weniger Sport attestiert mir die Venu einen Ruhepuls von 42-47.Diese Fehler haben mich dazu bewegt, die Uhr zurückzusenden.======Fazit======Die Uhr ist ein passender Allrounder, mit noch einigermaßen akzeptablen Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis. Das wäre mein Fazit, wenn die Messungen funktioniert hätten. Ich weiß nicht, ob es nur an meinem Gerät lag. An mir sollte es nicht liegen, bei allen bisherigen Uhren hatte ich zumindest nie derartige Probleme. Mit dem absoluten Totalausfall in Sachen Sensoren ist die Venu meiner Erfahrung nach eine schlechte Wahl. Soetwas sollte bei dem Preis auch nicht im Ausnahmefall vorkommen.', ""Do yourself a favour and avoid the seller I used (they were (likely still are) in Spain) so I got hit for import tax, I tried to cancel once I realised but they were extremely unhelpful.

The Garmin App is also great and links to my fitness pal app so I can check my calorie intake etc. The battery life is OK but does depend on how you set the watch up based on the setting I have the watch will last around 3-4 days .I would recommend this watch', ""J'ai reçu cette montre connectée il y a deux jours .

En parlant de musique ce qui m'a fait écarter la Fitbit c'est qu'on ne peut télécharger des listes musicales qu'à partir de Deezer ou Amazon et seulement piloter Spotify sur votre portable  et que je suis abonnée à Spotify . Avec la Venu sq musique vous pourrez télécharger des titres à partir de Spotify , Deezer Amazon entre autres et votre propre musique ( semble t'il , j'ai pas encore essayé ) . Sinon la montre est très complète avec plein d'exercices qu'on peut surveiller dont l'elliptique , le tapis en salle , et le vélo en salle ( à condition de disposer d'un accessoire compteur de vitesse ou de cadence à fixer sur le vélo , j'attends le mien ) . Sinon au niveau des paramètres physiologiques , c'est très complet avec des choses amusantes comme le niveau de stress ou le compteur d'énergie interne . Dans ce qui compte vraiment les pulsations sont  justes ( j'ai controlé ) et le sommeil aussi dans la mesure ou on se couche pour dormir et qu'on se lève d'un bond d'un seul , sans flemmarder , ni lire , ni surveiller tristement les statistiques du Covid sur sa tablette .... l'oxymétrie nécessite une immobilité absolue pour bien fonctionner .Une chose est sure c'est que cette montre  occupe , meme avec une grosse habitude des logiciels informatiques la régler pour l'adapter à vos possibilités sportives est quand meme un peu compliqué et le manuel d'utilisation téléchargeable aide mais n'explique pas tout . Ceci dit j'ai eu un petit souci avec un écran de veille dont je n'arrivais pas à me débarrasser , un petit coup de chat avec  Garmin et c'était arrangé . Donc vous n'etes pas seul !! Il y a aussi le site IQ Connect ou vous pourrez télécharger des cadrans et des applications dont Spotify  , la plupart gratuites . Coté esthétique , elle est vraiment élégante meme si un peu grosse pour mes petits poignets , mais l'écran est bien lisible . Coté batterie c'est comme de tout , si vous la sollicitez beaucoup il faudra la charger souvent . Je suis donc satisfaite de mon achat , mais pour les personne peu habituées aux méandres des logiciels informatiques  mieux vaut à mon avis opter pour des modèles plus simples."", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Como resumen en el vídeo comento lo siguiente:- Es la versión en azul granito, aunque es más gris que otra cosa.- Tiene 43 mm de esfera, el tamaño perfecto.- La pantalla AMOLED le da un plus de calidad, siendo más interesantes los watchfaces.- Ciertos watchfaces cargan lento, algo que fastidia la experiencia.- Autonomía de unos 4-5 días sin problema.

There are three separate app launchers.The button functionality is a mess e.g. for media controls the top button is Back, the bottom button is Forward, the middle button is Close. Why is the middle button Close!? Why isn\'t it Play/Pause!?There\'s a heap of bloatware apps that you can\'t uninstall. There\'s also invisible apps that you can uninstall, but you can\'t run those apps.WTF is the Fossil app?? I think it might actually be a broken app because it literally does nothing.

Slightly disappointed with battery life else everything is good', ""The latest Gen 5 Carlyle smartwatch from Fossil is by far the most attractive & comfortable smart watch I have owned. Being light with a slimline profile, it's ideal for wearing with both casual or formal attire - something that cannot be said for some of the chunkier smart watches on the market today. It’s an elegant watch, especially when paired with the leather straps, however the straps are interchangeable, so can be easily swapped for a silicone or metal strap of some sort to suit ones style. It's also waterproof up to 30M, so you don’t even need to bother taking it off when having a shower afterwards.The watch is running WEAR 2.0 which includes all the standard WearOS features we're familiar with, however a few additional points standout on the Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle:•They have provided customisable battery use management options; There are 3 pre-set modes, plus you can customise which features are turned on/off, and when. I’ve had it running with most features turned on (GPS, heart monitor, wifi, Bluetooth, etc), but generally keep “Always On” off. By the end of the day there is between 20-30% battery life left. There’s also a “Time Only” function if battery life gets critically low.•The charging disk is all multi-directional, so as long as it is in contact with the back off the watch, it will charge it. No need to line up connection points, etc which is very handy. Also charges from 0% to 100% in around an hour.•The Tiles feature is also a nice addition to the WEAR OS experience, allowing to customise which tiles are shown when swiping left. The OS only supports a handful of tiles such as Google Fit, calendar, calculator, etc so will be interesting to see how this feature develops as new tiles are added.Finally, the performance is top notch, with no glitching or latency when navigating the menus or apps, which has been a problem with other smart watches I’ve owned. It's capable of pairing and fully functional with both Android and iOS smartphones.Overall, I’m very pleased with the Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle smartwatch and would highly recommend it to both seasoned smartwatch owners and new smart watch converts alike."", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Es un buen reloj es elegante y sencillo a la vez, la batería dura alrededor de 17 horas con un uso mínimo, pero con la pantalla siempre encendida.

Also have google assistant in it,Never wanted Bixby hence did not go for a samsung gear.I dont like wearing my watch while working out and find it distracting hence never searched for a Fit watch.So i suggest prior to buying or investing your money , make a list of your requirements and see if you actually need it or not.Pros about the watch-Call Quality - perfect.wifi Bluetooth Connections - Great - found no issues.looks Rich and quite big.Get an 8Gb storage in it and can store music, Also download playstore apps for it which i loved although its all due to WEAR OS.Google assistant works smoothly in it.at 1st it had some glitches so i had to reset the watch and after that it's now working fine.Its like a phone on your hand simple.Cons -Battery life - that's a little too harsh and drains quite quickly. but that's if your apps installed are running, or the other features are kept on.The firmware- got a software update instantly but found that there's a minor slowdown there in the fluidity of the watch interface but nonetheless it hardly is noticeable. Other than this i found it to be perfect and worth it's money.if you have the money go for it, dont think twice.Samsung gears offer much lesser festures in this price so think about it🙂"", ""The watch looks elegant on hand. Display is amoled and is smooth and clear. Below are the the pros and cons.ProsLook. - You will fall in love with this design at first sight.Wear os - This is one of the budgetary watch which runs on googles wear os.Watch faces - Multiple and multiples of watch faces and most of them are classy.Microphone - Works good and sound from speaker is also good.Notifications - One of the good and most usable feature. We can reply for all the notifications as same as how we can do it on phone.Light weight.Cons.Wear os - Software is too buggy that some time connectivity cracks. Wifi disconnects frequently . While we are on call microphone works smoothly but speaker cracks. That makes other ends voice barely audible for me.Battery back up - Battery back up is very poor. You can only use it for mx. 7-8hrs with moderate use.Fitness tracking - Not at all accurate and it will never remind you to move if you are sitting idle for long time.GPS - GPS is built in only but it works smoothy only when connected with phone.Play music - The main thing I have purchased this watch is for that I don't need to bring phone to hear music while going for jogging and I can directly connect to my Bluetooth headset with smart watch and play music. But I have struggled sync local downloaded music with Google's play music app and at last i have downloaded some third-party app and done it.Verdict - This watch is perfect for people who are using android phones and looking for apple watch kind of feeling.For 21k it worth it only when google fixes their buggy wear OS. Only software part and battery back up needs improvements."", 'Great product , battery lasts for one day with moderate use. Fonts are little small even if opt for large. Elegant look .Can manage with wear OS mobile app.', 'It has been 3 days i am using this. Lets talk about only the cons:There is only one i saw i.e btterybackup.In daily mode it works 8 hours. Its only when you are not opening th watch means ideal condition everything is open in daily mode.If you are using it and searching anything on it then hardly 3 to 4 hours. So it is not for those who use it heavily.Pro:If it is tight on your hand with always on display the very first impression you get that its really a watch its not like samsung and other watch which look like toy in hand.All feature is amazing.UPDATE: Fossil update their OS now their is no fuzzy sound while you are on call with watch you can listen clrystal clear voice of other and you too can talk without issue.I really loved that watch the only thing is that battery backup if that will be taken care off then it will beat all watches of other brands including apple too coz the named watch is really suit on it coz its a watch not a phone and smart watch means all features of phn in it.You will really not dissappointed if you take it i am 100% sure . The only issue is battry backup but the good thing in it is that its charge also quickly so really good for those who travels in a car they can opt the charging there. All feature of phn is in it. So highly recommend it dor those who didnt care about battry backup.Other modes are also their they will extend your battry upto 2 days and also 4 days if you set time only mode than it will work like ordinary analog watch so its depend on you what type of user you are. Whats app other message n all things you can control through it. Google assistant and even you can type through watch its really easy due to dragging method.

Google assistant will only work when your PHONE is connected to WiFi, so please note that.- Feature-Rich(ish) - Watch capabilities are up there, you can do a lot with it.

Had to re pair the damn thing every two hours, which leaves you at a disadvantage. This is the sole reason/purpose that I have returned my product. Waste of money (and time) for me.- Some watchfaces are really out there and make it hard to read the time. What the damn were they thinking? That's the priority for a watch. But okay, the regular watchfaces make it easy to do that, but the collaborations they made for watchfaces really didn't turn out very well.- Google Assistant (yes, both a pro and a con) - Sadly assistant would misinterpret voice commands. maybe that is saying more for the mic than google assistant, you decide.- Doesn't reflect events made in calendar, notifications amiss (iPhone) and scheduled alarms don't really go off all the time (?) which I don't understandHope this helps.

Either this is a clone or something has happened! 23k spent and this I recieved!! Just amazing work!! People who don't know will definitely get fooled! Please look into it Amazon"", 'Unfortunately I only owned this watch for three weeks before I had to sell it on my company\'s ""Buy and Sell"" forum. The watch itself is beautiful, and WearOS is solid, but besides using the device as an everyday watch, I also had planned on using it for my fitness needs. I run and swim multiple times a week, and from what I had read online the Fossil Gen 5 should have easily met my needs. However, after my first run with Google Fit I discovered that this app (the default for running activities) does NOT track split/interval times. This should be a very basic requirement for any running watch. So, instead, I downloaded a number of different apps. First, Strava... but Strava only tracks runs if tethered to a phone, and I am not going to bring my phone with me on my runs. Over the course of many days I tried Nike Run Club, Ghostracer, MyRunning App, MapMyRun and Adidas Running, and either these apps did not use the watch\'s built in GPS, or would inexplicably stop recording my run in the midst of the run!In regard to the swimming, Google Fit does not have a swim tracker at all, so I had to download a couple of alternatives. Swim.com was the better of the two, but it did not do a great job of accurately counting my lengths, and then trying to stop the timer at the end of my swim was ridiculously complicated.Something else I did not mention above, when I do run I like to listen to music. On my current watch (which I have gone back to) I can listen to my Spotify playlists, even when offline. The Spotify app on the Fossil Gen 5 does not have an offline option, so again, to listen to Spotify I would have to bring my phone with me. It does allow offline music from Google Music, but since that is not where my music lives, that did not do me any good.So, in the end I had to sell the watch. It just did not work for me, but if you were looking for a great smartwatch, and the fitness aspects are not a priority, I would say the Fossil Gen 5 would be good for you. If, on the other hand, fitness tracking is important, I would look elsewhere.', ""The battery is absolute garbage. It's unable to do everything it says it can while also lasting for over 8 hours.

The build quality, the screen quality, the buttons, the crowns, the chain, everything which is tangible is exceptional.The fault is of Google and its Wear OS. Google has totally abandoned Wear OS and not launching any updates.

It is crisp, vivid and bright, so you can still see your time out in the sunshine.Lots of amazing watch faces to choose from, really customizable except for the 5 tiles restriction.Fully compatible with all Android phones unlike flagship watches from Apple or Samsung.The software is a bit buggy, but still feels smooth and the stock experience is unreal.The battery (if you configure your watch effeciently (no continuous heart rate monitoring, no wifi, no nfc, all time Bluetooth on)) will last you one day and a half unless you use the watch constantly (in which, you\'ll go from 100 to 0 in 3-4hrs)The speaker is decent, the microphone is also decent.Overall I\'m glad I bought this watch at the right time. Hopefully things will get better in the future with the upcoming graphene batteries and better smartphone-flagship chipsets.', ""Hi,I purchased a Fossil Gen5 watch which was delivered on 20th June and right from.the start there have been consistent issues with the product.1. The package that I recieved already had the watch out of the grooves.2. The watch stopped working in the middle of an update (for 2 days)3. The battery drained out in 30 min (from 70% to 0)4. Now the watch has stopped working beacuse it just won't charge.I have tried multiple power sources but it still doesn't seem to be working.This incompetence in product quality control or vendor verification baffles me. The only reason I did not return this product is the fact that reviews said the OS takes time to stabalise but this is just a defective product from an unreliable vendor that needs to be checked right away.I would have been ok to take this watch to the Fossil service station but the lockdown has made this impossible and the date of return on the app seems to have eneded.I'm requesting for a complete refund on this product since there's no point suffering with a high value defective product.Request your immediate attention"", 'Well, to start with I just moved over from the iOS ecosystem to Android world, and love my new, shiny Samsung Galaxy Note 10. So, this Fossil Gen 5 release date was Godsend to coincide with my decision to switch to Android and Note 10 release as my old Apple Watch won\'t work with my new Android phone.Absolutely floored by the slim design of Fossil Watch, how easily it connected with my Note 10. Aesthetics wise I like it more than my Apple Watch; even got praises on how well it looks.And the fascination just stopped there. I wish the screen could be more brighter. I have set the brightness at 5 (maximum) and I still thinks it\'s not bright enough. And the battery life. Within just 6 hours of use, my watch came down from 100% to 24%! Well, the watch boasts of ""Extended"" and ""Time Only"" modes in addition to the ""Daily"" mode (with all the smart features enabled). I looked at the ""Extended"" mode setting to find out that all the features are set to OFF in the watch except you can hit the crown to wake up your watch, notifications and vibrations are On, and the Bluetooth is available from 6 AM - 10 PM only. All the cool options, such as Speaker, WiFi, Touch-to-wake, Tilt-to-Wake, NFC, OK Google detect options are disabled.Come on; I bought a smart watch for a reason. Otherwise, $295 would have fetched me a very stunning and performant non-smart watch.Let\'s not even imagine what the third, ""Time Only"", option would turn my watch into. Perhaps, every time I needed to see time in my watch, I had to call Fossil customer care and then they would have either enabled the display for 10 seconds or just told me over the phone what I wanted to know from my watch!Perhaps, I am being harsh but I can\'t help it when I am coming from a perfectly fine smartwatch (Apple Watch) that won\'t work with Android phones, and you\'re just left to this.Fossil, I urge you to work on the battery drainage and brightness things as the top-priority things to fix in this watch. Otherwise, you will just end up with customers like me who are not all happy with this purchase. I won\'t recommend this watch, at least not until Fossil fixed the battery issue at the minimum!', ""I bought it as a gift. Unfortunately the battery life is extremely bad. After charging 100% and not even using it, it gets discharged within 5 hours. And it doesn't come with warranty. We have to go to the fossil retail showroom to get the warranty which is not convenient. Worst part is battery life .

If u want to get it, better go to a proper showroom and get it"", ""This Watch is great wear os watch, but the battery life is just bad..It could not even last 12 hours (Always on display, Bluetooth, Notification on rest all off).Also just want to put it there, in wear os you could not find native sleep tracking, had to use 3rd party apps.. which aren't great."", 'Slightly overpriced, just ""slightly"" because it still has a cheap-ish feel to it especially with some of the bands which you wouldn\'t have expected them to skimp out on but arguably one of the best you can get for WearOS as an overall...so ultimately can\'t complain and that\'s why I gave it 5 stars, massive step up from other WearOS watches I\'ve owned. Though the battery life is a lil underwhelming initially but I\'ve been told it gets slightly better over time as the watch calibrates itself. Will update further down the line if I end up having issues with the charging ring, because those were the main concerns I\'ve seen from most reviews and people who\'ve owned the watch for a longer time they noted the battery life and the charging ring wearing out quickly.', ""I guess i can rate something below 1 star.This is the worst product from fossil.

There are numerous watch faces available and I found one that is large and enables me not needing my reading glasses to see the time (still need them sometimes for other functions but that speaks more to my 60+ eyes and is no reflection on the watch). I have been using it to track my gym workouts. I like to mix in a mixture of strength training with different types of cardio and the workout function on the watch provides a long list of possible activities to track. So far I am happy with the look and functionality of the watch but a little disappointed with the battery life. Unless I leave it on extended setting, which doesn't provide the time without depressing the centre button, it barely makes it through the day without needing a charge."", ""What a beautifully designed watch! I had to force myself to return this due to ONE single flaw: Wear OS! After Tizen with 2 days battery life, this one is simply horrible. I tried every trick in the book and every suggestion and even reset the device twice since I didn't want to return it. Alas! It lasted 4-5 hours before turning off many features. Absolutely pathetic OS. So, sorry for Fossil with such great design and features but the OS just became its Achilles heel. If you are patient, there's an update (Wear OS 3) promised for end of 2022 but it's anyone's guess if that would even satisfactorily address this battery issue. Moved on to the impeccable and gorgeous Withings and never looked back.

Google Assistant kept crashing, and after hours of Googling, the problem turned out to be that my phone was set to ""English (US)"" while my watch had defaulted to ""English (Canada)"". Even after fixing the crashes, I was never able to get basic functionality like reminders working. Notifications are hit or miss, and many of the Wear OS apps I\'d been excited to try had critical problems. Heart rate tracking is inaccurate to the point of being useless, and either I\'ve taken up sleep-jogging or the activity tracking also has some issues.

Takes about an hour to charge from 0 to full.3. The excercise mode is great and tracks the movements well.4. The alarm and vibration are sufficient, not too high but just right and noticable.Tracks your daily activities well. Also you get a good amount of pre-installed watch faces which look quite premium.The battery life isn't equivalent to a few other smartbands but it compensates well with faster recharge and other functionalities. Connects well with Android. A good watch to have in your collection."", 'Bought it with very high hopes, and doesn\'t disappoint, until you are well a few hours into it.First, the OS is very well built, clean, and light, takes a bit of a learning curve but is actually pretty decent once you get used to it, and it does lag a bit when you are downloading firmware and software updates but that\'s almost about it.Secondly, the design is minimalistic but very very charming, there is a ""new toy"" charm when you first buy it,  but considering how quick I lose interest in things, it was very surprising that I kept finding reasons to just look at it, not fiddle, not play, just look, the display is crisp and vibrant and it took me a while to actually register that the call that I\'ve connected to is on my watch speaker and not the phone speaker, so kudos to that on the hardware front, that along with swim resistance makes you feel a lot like your hand is in a good watch.Third, the watch faces are not limited by any means, I\'ve yet to find fully customizeable watch face with my very own choice of wallpapers, but that\'s about the limit of what isn\'t there, or quite possibly what I haven\'t found yet, even so, the watch faces available are customizable to some extent which keeps things from getting monotonous.Fourth, and this one is important, at first it\'ll feel like there is a bit of a connectivity issue with the wifi and the bluetooth, there isn\'t, once on your home wifi, turn the bluetooth off on the watch and the primary connection goes to wifi and you can keep using the watch as you were, helps save battery, god knows you\'ll need to do quite a bit for that. If you turn bluetooth and wifi on at the same time, primary connection remains at bluetooth and as soon as you leave the wifi setting, it\'ll disconnect from it, don\'t worry if that happens, there is nothing wrong with your smartwatch.Lastly, and the only sort of a bummer here. It burns through battery at any mode which isn\'t aimed specifically at power saving, even on the ""extended"" mode, I lost about 15% charge in under an hour, with little to no usage, it helps that it charges at a decent pace, not too slow, not too quick, but it does make you feel sometimes like it should have been quicker.Considering how wide a brand Fossil is, it\'s one of the safest bet to buy in the budget of around 20K as you can take it to any fossil brand store, and there are plenty around the country, should you face any factory problems, which is very unlikely to begin with, around 5-6 people in my peer group have been using fossil smartwatches from the gen 3 to now gen 5, and no complaints that you wouldn\'t have gotten with regular wear of a smartwatch of any other brand to begin with.', ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0After update, cannot contact with internet first, and after update so many 3rd party app installed automatically and i can't un-install them.

I don't know if these are problems with Wear OS or only on that watch, but these problems and a few more can make the experience quite a bit painful sometimes.Now, an aspect that most reviews talk about, the battery. Unless you turn on the battery saving mode or disable some features that are enable by default and that shouldn't drain that much battery, the battery most likely won't last the entire day, and even less if do workout tracking with it. That is one of the worse aspect of the watch since a smart watch is made to follow you in your entire day and help you with all you want during that day, not to have some wanted features turned off to have enough battery or have it turned of or charging a part of the day. At that price point, I expect to have at least a decent battery that lasts the entire day.Otherwise, everything goes pretty well with that watch as long as it's not part of the few problems of the software that the watch has. It is equiped with decent technology (excluding the battery) and is pretty fluid. It also does mostly what you would expect from a smart watch.In conclusion, the watch is pretty much well equiped and is fast, but the few bugs there are and the bad battery life just makes this watch not worth it. It's battery life and the few other problems are just pretty basic things that should definitely not have it's place on a smart watch that is at that price point. I wouldn't recommend this watch to people who asks me about it. At the end, it's your decision, but you should think about it before buying."", ""The biggest drawback is the limitation in features. Right now, the price is ₹22,995 but features are not at all enough for that price. It has NFC but useless as Google has not added Google Pay yet in Wear OS in India. It's kind of illogical that we use Google Pay on our phones in India but Google thinks Google Pay in smartwatch is not needed yet by Indians. If you are even thinking to buy this... JUST STOP... I am a fan of Fossil watches but this smartwatch let me down. Just compare it with Samsung Galaxy Active 2 smartwatch. Almost the same price but way more loaded with features even in Galaxy watch App.Wear OS application doesn't have anything in them.Battery life was a huge disappointment for me in this watch. Even with smart battery modes, you can't even think of using your watch without charging for complete 2 days.Many a times I also faced pairing issues with this watch. I noticed many times I am getting a call on my phone but watch is not notifying me.To conclude I would just say don't waste your money and time on this, istead if you have this budget, go for galaxy watches which offer much more in this price range.All the best!"", ""So I'll jump straight into the pros and cons which I felt after using the for one weekPros:  1. Display and Touch Response : The display looks  and feels great. Only in direct sunlight the  visibility gets bit of compromised even with  sunlight booster enabled. Touch response is  also very nice but you have to be precise about  your touch as you are not dealing with a  smartphone screen :P  2. Features: Google's Wear OS brings in alot of  nice features to this product like google fit,  meditation exercises etc. Plus it is easy to  configure this device by using your phone with  the help of Wear OS app. 3. Battery Life: the previous Fossil smartwatches  had lots of issue with the battery life and I  guess Fossil has finally been able to solve it.  The watch runs for almost 2 days straight after  getting fully charged( Daily normal usage). 4. Build Quality: ok you are spending more than  20k for a watch so it is absolutely a necessity for  the watch to look and feel premium. And it  does. The build quality is supernice with metalic  circular dial, sharp clear screen and also the  rubber strap is feels great( I was sceptical about  the rubber strap as I am a fan of leather ones  but trust me it is of super quality, when you touch  it you can literally feel how good the rubber quality is.Now coming to the CONs1. Connectivity: The bluetooth connectivity is good  but faced some issue with the Wi-Fi. Takes a bit  of time to connect to the wifi and flactuates  very often( Gets disconnected).2. Google Assistant not responding: Faced this  issue quite a lot. Out of 10 times only twice or  thrice get the response from GA but maximum  of times it showed some error like Assistant is  not responding, there were some issues  connecting you etc.3. Battery Life: You might think I have put the  battery life in pros then why I am putting it on  Cons again. The reason is with comparison to  previous edition Fossil smartwatches this watch  has much better battery life but in this price  range most of it's competitors are having  greater battery life. So this is down point for this  product.4.Bad Speaker: The most irritating thing of this  watch is the speaker quality. It almost sounds  terrible. No clarity whatsover and the volume is  low too. An area to improve for later generation  Fossil smartwatches.All in all a decent product to have but what I would suggest is to go through different products as well like apple, samsung etc because it is better to search and find a product ehich best suits you when you are paying a hefty amount."", 'Worst Product I have ever bought in amazon.Look wise fossil lives up to its standard. 5 star for it.Other than that there is no positive in this product.Battery drain in 3 Hrs in Daily use mode.Quality of the charger is pathetic.Sound clarity on the speaker is horrible.Fossil should stop manufacturing this product, rather than spoiling its name & brand image.', 'Very bad product.

By noon it was at 27%. It’s a shame because Wear OS is excellent, just not on this watch. I had the watch running on the bare minimum of functions, still the battery was draining quickly. What is the use of having a smart watch when you are not able to use all the functions due to the absolutely terrible battery. Please don’t waste your money on this watch.', ""Had to return the watch after the screen broke for no apparent reason (I am very careful with my technology. I did not do anything with it that should have damaged the screen). The battery life was also complete garbage for a watch that costs this much money. Didn't even last half a day.

Me animé por la actualización para las llamadas, por los análisis de sueño que ahora se iban a incluir en la versión no premium de Fitbit y por la rebaja de más de 4000 pesos. Total, lo compré, la primera opinión es que es un smart watch bonito; repito sabía todo.Que muchas de las carátulas te cuestan. Cierto.Que mucha gente se quejó del botón. No me importó, y es muy cierto que tienes que desactivar la función de dejarlo apretado, de otra forma vas a iniciar lo que programaste porque se inicia a cada rato cuando presionas la muñeca..Que no se puede guardar música y que se requiere una cuenta premium de Spotify para que sirva. Cierto.Que su sistema operativo no es tan ágil como otros. Muy cierto.No me importó nada.Hasta que un día me levanto con la noticia que había recorrido mil pasos durante la noche, pensé que había sido una falla del sistema, hasta que empezó a pasar todas las noches.Empiezo la investigación, encuentro que más gente reporta lo mismo, que no hay una forma de borrar los pasos y la quema de calorías ficticia, ah, y que probablemente sucedería lo mismo mientras manejo.A ver, un reloj que te cuesta 9000 pesos, ni siquiera puede hacer esto bien. Tienen una aplicación frustrante, de verdad, y nunca pude hacer funcionar el asistente de google.Total, si buscas un reloj «diferente» que se vea bien, pero con el que batalles para las cosas más esenciales, no busques más. Este es para ti.', 'La verdad es que ha sido una auténtica decepción, adquirí uno para un familiar y otro para mí y al final he tenido que devolverlos. Paso a enumerar todos los problemas que he tenido:1. El botón háptico a veces no funciona.2. A veces no recibes las notificaciones y si las recibes correctamente se van almacenando, pero llega un momento en el que se borran y ya no puedes responder ningún mensaje.3. Solo puedes responder a los mensajes, pero no puedes enviar ningún mensaje sin que previamente no te hayan enviado uno.4. Hay momentos en los que falla buscar el móvil, y cuando lo busca y suena el teléfono, permanece apagado, por lo que a veces tienes el móvil delante y aunque suene no lo ves. Para que pare de sonar tienes que darle a ""parar"" en la pantalla, no sirve poner la mano para que cese la búsqueda.5. No puedes acceder a ciertas apps de mensajería, solo las prefijadas por fitbit, por lo que es una restricción bastante importante para aquellos que usamos varias aplicaciones de mensajería.6. Fitbit te dice que puedes responder llamadas con este smartwatch, pero no es así, solo puedes descolgar, pero no puedes usar el micrófono del smartwatch para hablar, lo que hace esta característica es ponerte el móvil en función manos libres, que si lo tienes guardado en algún lugar cerrado, tampoco te escucharán.7. Alexa es muy restrictiva en este dispositivo, no puedes enviar un mensaje o llamar, solo sirve para hacerle preguntas del tiempo o quién es el presidente del gobierno.8. Muchas aplicaciones están en inglés, como la meditación guiada, que no es que no me defienda con el inglés, pero fitbit debería haberse tomado cierto interés con los idiomas.9. Y ya por último decir que de momento no trae el asistente de Google ni la función electrocardiograma que dicen que integra, lo implementarán más adelante, pero a día de hoy no están disponibles.Lo único bueno de este smartwatch es la duración de batería que dicen que tiene (unos 6 días), el diseño y su calidad, que con su acabado con bordes en metal y el cristal gorilla glass lo convierten en un wearable bastante elegante.', ""Fitibit sense dovrebbe fare un sacco di cose, promesse nella pubblicità e nelle caratteristiche riportate, ma....non le fa.E' uno sport watch, assolutamente non smart. Infatti, acquistandolo a prezzo pieno, si ottiene un orologio ricco di aspettative che nel pratico, non sono eseguibili. Prima fra tutte, l'ecg non ancora abilitato. Poi abbiamo google non ancora presente. La messaggistica è pessima, dato che non appena si riceve una notifica, questa sparisce appena la leggiamo senza restare in archivio. Non c'è ancora modo di immagazzinare musica per ascoltare solo con smartwatch, ma si deve utilizzare spotify oppure un altro programma a pagamento.Il gps con me non ha mai funzionato.C'è un parco app che non è ancora disponibile, e non capisco come abbiano potuto mettere il prodotto sul mercato se ancora non è attivo in tutte le sue sfacettature.Una cosa che mi ha motlo infastidito sono i grafici della app, incompresibili. Ossigenazione e temperatura si calcolano solo di notte e non si riesce  aleggerne i valori reali, ma solo percentuali assolutamente ignote.I passi sono soprastimati, poichè in mezza giornata raggiungi diecimila passi anche stando fermo e muovendo solo le braccia.Le attività sportive bloccano qualsiasi utilizzo dell'orologio, perciò non si può nemmeno uscire dalla schermata per cambiar musica o fare altro.Ci sono troppe cose che ancora non vanno e per il prezzo, direi che non ne vale ancora la pena. Bocciatissimo."", ""It took me 2 weeks to decide whether to buy the Sense or not. I read uncountable reviews and was very hesitant. Since I own a smartwatch but wanted a really good health tracker in addition I thought I just chance it and try the Sense 4 weeks ago,At first I had problems setting it up. It just wouldn't connect to my phone. I tried for hrs and googled. After midnight I found out that I cannot have 2 watches paired with my phone. So there was nothing wrong wit the Fitbit Sense, I just had to unpair the other watch, I then reset the Sense (long press and hold of the button/indent for more than 10 secs) and voila, it worked a treat. In the meantime I had already started return of the item and printed all documents ;-)After 4 weeks I have now cancelled the return because I am 100% happy with my purchase.If you are a serious runner, you wouldn't go for a Fitbit anyway,right? You might go for Garmin or Polar. The Sense is ideal for those you want to track steps, sleep, HR, ECG and so much more. The SpO2 will only be measured during the night so you can see the value next morning. This is important for me because I have slight sleep apnoea and I like to know if it goes below 90%.Yes, in order to see the SpO2 you need to choose a certain watch face, I don't see a problem with that. If you need SpO2 monitoring all day you can buy an SpO2 metre to clip on the index finger.When you use this special watch face you can tap on the screen and it switches from SpO2 to  HR, another tap to steps, next tap to active mins, another tap to floors ( the only one I switched off. I don't use it )I have no problems with the indent /button at the side. It is just a matter of getting used to it. I have NEVER experienced that by bending my hand I accidentally would have hit the button. That never happened.The HR is very accurate, I compared it with the HR my Samsung watch showed at the same time(not connected to phone)The sensors have been very reliable .Some complain about lagging. I have no problems with that. It is a new watch with new sensors , there will be updates soon and I am positive that this point will be addressed. I do believe it depends on the phone the Sense is connected to and the firmware version of the watch. I had an update 2 days after set up and my watch works perfectly fine.Battery life is amazing. with 3 x 30min jogs with GPS every week and many notifications from several apps and even accepting phone calls my Sense last about 4 1/2 days. The charging speed is outstanding, it'll blow you away. 10 mins from 4% to 25% keeps me going all day if I forget to charge in time. I don't have to charge over night and miss out on sleep tracking. I charge when I'm watching telli. The charger is a strong magnetic one that attaches easily to the watch and doesn't fall off.The wristband is like most others : the silicone-sweaty-sort-of-thing. This is one thing I don't like but I found an elastic fabric one on Amazon.com and I just love it. I am hyper sensitive to all rubber/silicone so the elastic one is brilliant for me.What I also don't like is that to some of the features in the app you have only access to with Fitbit subsciption. This is included in the purchase for 6 months. I will not renew it and will be happy to read the stats, after 6 months I'm sure I know what they tell me.So as you can see , I am happy with the Sense and am confident that with future updates it will be even more exiting. We should be a bit patient, everything new can have hickups. I only encountered one: after changing the watch face, suddenly there were no data on my watch screen, it showed the symbol for steps but no figure, yet in the app all steps were shown. A simple reset of the watch (press button for more than 10 secs, hold and wait for Fitbit sign to appear) solved the problem.At last: I live in Ireland and my Sense already has the ECG feature which works a treat. Some countries will get this feature with a next update, as I understand."", ""E' il quarto fitbit che acquisto , ma il sense e' veramente una delusione.Non c'e'l'ecg promesso, la misurazione della temperatura corporea non esiste , c'e' una misurazione della variazione della temperatura cutanea notturna che non serve a nulla se non si conosce la temperatura puntuale, la saturazione non funziona, il gps si aggancia dopo tre minuti quindi i report degli allenamenti sono sballati, la batteria non dura più di tre giorni e non sei giorni come promesso, infine ci sono difficolta' ad accendere alla schermata home, occorre scuoterlo più' volte. Il cinturino e'pessimo : ho lo stigmate sul braccio. Non vale 329 euro. Se non fanno gli aggiornamenti entro il16 ottobre lo restituisco ad Amazon. Sconsigliato!"", ""Ok so i have been a active user of Fitbit for many many years and this is myost favourite device yet! The battery life is very good and I think I maybe getting 3 to 4 days (can't be 100%) as one of the apps on the watch was in use without me knowing due to a short cut I created!😂 Changed now. The mobile app has NOT changed but has new additional information because of the additional info the Sense can collect. The accuracy seems the same as my versa except I seem to be sleeping better! Overall it's clean with a beautiful screen and doesn't appear any heavier on my wrist than my versa. The onboard gps is a great addition but don't add the walking exercise to the shortcuts as it will pick you up running round the house! A few tiny glitches but these will get sorted over time. There is no onboard music storage who h is a complete disappointment as I used to load up my versa and use it in the gym leavingyibile iny locker. But again, my most favourite Fitbit device yet."", ""So I got this delivered on lauch day (25th September) and have worn it every day and night since.I have had many fitbit trackers in the past and the last one was the Ionic. I gave up on the Ionic after a year because I had so many issues with it, the worst being it would loose connection with my phone for no reason and then I had to unpair, delete and re install time and time again.I have been using the Samsung galaxy watch active 2 since and it was an excellent smartwatch but its fitness tracking was not good mostly because of the calories burned during exercise which was so off.I was excited to see the Sense on the fitbit website before it launched and I decided to treat myself. I always buy from Amazon because their customer service and aftercare is excellent.Putting it simply I love this watch. It looks great, feels premium and the screen is bright and clear. I'm fully used to the haptic button and prefer it to an actual button as it means that the watch will be better protected from water.My only problem is that when doing strenuous exercise like spinning the heart rate sensor takes a while to register the high heart rate reached, sometimes my heart rate slows a bit before the watch catches up which meand I miss out on the top range readings of my heart rate. Also the watch seems to think my heart rate drops down into the 110 to 120 bpm after an intense interval but my heart rate is definitely still really high in between hard efforts so this does bother me.  My Ionic did this when I first got it but it seemed to improve over time so I'm hoping that the Sense does too. My guess is that it is something software related which can be fixed. Also when weight training the watch puts my heart rate at 110 to 120 bpm when I know that after doing squats for 6 solid minutes with a weights bar my heart rate is way higher, my Samsung puts my heart rate at 140 to 150 bpm for this. Walking seems accurate as does martial arts and kick boxing. Maybe fitbit could fix this with an update.All of the features of this watch are great and I love it. I'm looking forward to seeing what updates come in the future to improve things. I'm especially looking forward to being able to answer phone calls on the watch as this was a big feature I enjoyed with my Samsung. The new os is nice and the connection to the phone is way more stable but it did drop out once so far and I had to unpair, delete and re install then it worked. I think that fitbit might be working on stability now as it needs to be better to be able to take calls on the watch so I'm guessing that's why we don't have that function yet.All in all I'm happy despite the niggles. I find this watch exciting.Update!My sense had to be sent back to fitbit today as it was faulty.  I'm very happy with fitbit customer service so far as they are replacing my sense with very little effort to action this.Unfortunately though Amazon now don't replace faulty products after the 1st 30 days. They used to replace faulty products up to a year after purchase which is why I bought it from them. I will just buy from the manufacturer in the future now. I have to say the Amazon customer service lady was excellent,  not her fault that the procedure has changed. Just thought this might be an important point to make incase anyone else buys from Amazon because of the returns policy which has now changed."", ""This is my review of the Fitbit sense after wearing for 2 monthsPros: -battery lasts a long time and is quicker to charge than other models, the actual charger is much better as it works as a magnet to the device rather than the clip style Fitbit are most known to have- updated HR sensors, the ones on my old fitbits were very temperamental especially during sweaty workouts they would just cut off entirely at points, this watch does not have this issue, versa 3 also has the updated sensors.-looks very sleek compared with other models, other than it being a fitness tracker aesthetically speaking it is a nice watch.-fitness bands are much, much easier to switch between compared to other Fitbit models that use a pin type mechanism- screen display is clear, easy to read, options for always on mode so you don't have to manually turn on the display to view the time or your steps etc. The display feels a lot less clunky when swiping through your stats in comparison to previous watch models.-mobile app is useful and one of the reasons I'm loyal to the brand as it's very user friendly.-6months free premium in app subscription with purchase-google assistant and Amazon Alexa compatible-ability to take calls and read notifications and texts as they appear on your phone-sleep tracking much like on other models is useful and helps me aim to get more sleep each night, the daily sleep score is also a good indicator for improvementCons: - the price and the features you get Vs the versa 3 probably isn't worth an extra £100 in my opinion.-ECG feature seems quite gimmicky and I have only used it a couple times-stress sensoring features are not accurate in my opinion, I've had panic attacks wearing this watch and it has never alerted me of a raised hr as it's supposed to and my stress score has been good regardless of this so I would say this is either very buggy or just novelty.- just like all other official Fitbit straps I've experienced, I got a really bad rash. I highly recommend the adepoy third party brand of straps if you have this issue, steer clear of cavn (which was the most widely advertised straps when I initially went searching for a replacement) as they are made terribly and will snap inside your watch which is more than slightly alarmingOverall I am happy with my purchase but there is room for improvement and I definitely feel like the versa 3 would be just as good if you're not into the ECG features."", ""Received in early evening. By bedtime I had reactivated my old fitbit account and paired the Sense with my phone. Wore both my old tracker and Sense overnight to compare sleep tracking. By the morning I could not sync my phone and Sense, pairing had gone. Tried to set it up again, didn't work. Followed the on line help, no joy. After 2 long calls to fitbit support during which bluetooth was off and on, the sense was off and on, a factory reset for the sense, fitbit app uninstalled and reinstalled no success. Also installed fitbit app on a tablet and the same happened. Pairing disappeared and could not get it to work again. During this time I was asked to use the Sense button several times, it worked about 1 in 5 times. This should not happen with a £250 smartwatch so it was returned. Thanks to Amazon for their prompt service."", 'Looks and comfort great. Usability not so good! Once connected to phone, it diverts the notifications etc to watch,WHICH HAS NO NOTIFICATION SOUNDS. It was supposed to handle phone calls and have ECG capability,  but neither work. Its gestures and touch response were very poor and intermittent. I SENT IT BACK!!', ""I bought this as my first Fitbit was an Inspire 2, but the strap caused severe irritation and wasn't as fancy, it wasn't something I could proudly wear while on my weightloss journey. The strap in the Sense is the latest and most premium strap I've ever used, it uses a different mechanism of attaching to the wrist and is much softer.Regarding the watch, for the first day I found it not to be tracking my heart rate that much, I'm not sure if it was simply postional error on my wrist or that the watch needed to get used to being on my arm as I have tattoos. It now tracks my heartrate all the time, although some nights I've found it has said it didn't get a consistent read and therefore never gave the more accurate sleep reading which tells you amount of REM sleep amongst other factors.I find the watch is more accurate in measuring my steps, perhaps due to GPS, and additionally it tracks floor climbed which the Inspire 2 does not. It's much easier to track and start exerc than the Inspire and the Versa is probably similar, so if you don't need EDA or heart rhythm than it may be a better purchase. I decided to get the most premium watch Fitbit produced as I prefer the Fitbit app in terms of tracking moreso than the Samsung watch I've used before. It is very useful and the premium is worth it in my opinion.Battery life for me is 4 days with dim screen brightness and not being always on, and with using the sleep mode at night which stops the screen turning on as you move in bed. Overrall I highly recommend the watch, but if you don't need some features I'd say the Versa is good enough.Edit: Small movements like moving up a flight of stairs or slightly moving in bed cause the watch to not read my heart rate until I remove it and put it back on, therefore leading to inconsistent sleep data and a lot of hassle. For £300 this is incredibly inconvenient, therefore like a lot of reviewers I returned this watch. If it worked I would've kept it, and if it does work for you, keep it."", ""At first I was really pleased with my fit bit. It looks smart and it takes lots of measurements. However within a few weeks the flexible watch band came loose and the watch dropped off my wrist and landed on the floor face down.  The screen has smashed and cracked across. For a sports product I would have thought they would have made it more durable than this. Be warned there is no way of getting the screen repaired once it breaks unlike a phone or Apple watch. So you will have £300 of useless plastic. I am actually still paying for mine too. Also to say I got eczema from the band in my wrist which must contain latex or similar and really flared up my allergies. As a final point many of the good features such as ECG you have to pay a subscription for after a few months. Won't bother with a Fitbit again!"", 'Having had and used a Fitbit since the start, my last Fitbit Versa needed an upgrade....I reviewed many other smart watches from all makes, but, finally to stick with Fitbit and purchased the Fitbit Sense.....Big mistake...PROSLovely strap and fixes into place far more easier than any other Fitbit I had previouslyBigger screen and much clearer to readI liked the push to get it going...despite some reviews, I had no problems operating itGreat Apps and I loved the 6month free premium albeit draining of battery if had all onSO..... apart from that I have nothing else to recommend THE Fitbit SenseCONSBattery life shockingly very short...longer if you took off all the apps that monitor your exercise health and fitnessConstantly not synching, apps not workingAND FOR me the worst thing about it was, it was not registering the correct steps/miles ECT from my runs on Treadmill and/exercisesI did sought advice from Fitbit help/community forum, to no avail, I felt I was fobbed off regarding the accuracy of mile sand/steps ran was down to GPS....sorry, but I did not have any of these problems with my Versa, which i have had for 3yrs....It was after several times uninstalling and reinstalling the Sense and still not working as advertised that I reluctantly had to send back.At £245, I expected the Sense to be working as advertised and yes I know they did do an operating upgrade to sort out glitches, it was obviously not enough.I for one am very very disappointed in the Fitbit Sense because if it was working as well as advertised, I could have enjoyed using it as my upgrade fitness smart watch.I have now gone back to my trusty old Versa where, at least, my miles and steps are in synch along with everything else', ""Bit of history I've had fitbits for years now.. they've survived through, house renovations.. Crossfit and well even me getting run over!  Got the sense back in May, had it only 2 months and accidentally dropped it.... not from great height on to my kitchen floor the screen smashed.  Which amazed me because all my old ones (the last being the Versa 2) have been so robust.... I thought no worries I'm clumsy I'll get a screen... much to my despair they don't do replacement screens!!!!  a £300 watch and you can't repair it! I'm devastated.  It worked for about a week after but now wont even charge.The actual watch was good and I want another but I'm really worried it won't last me. Some of the apps aren't great but it's improving all the time.  I'll agree with a lot of the reviews about the strap... I have sensitive skin and had to replace it within a week.So I'm currently debating if to buy another and get a screen protector... (ironically I had one in the draw but thought it made the watch look ugly/bulky.. and all my others didn't need it so went without) or continue with my Versa 2.  I'm missing the GPS and the in-depth sleep functions etc. but just can't bring myself to shell out another £300 ... well £279 as they are at the moment.I even contacted Fitbit and I have to say they weren't overly hopeful at all and didn't really get that I was upset I couldn't get spares not the fact I couldn't claim on the warranty.. I knew that from the start I dropped it!"", ""This Sense would have been my 5th Fitbit watch however changing to the longer strap I noticed one of the easy release tabs was extremely stiff and I broke a nail on it. Eventually I was able to release the short strap and replace it with the longer one. Within FOUR days the easy release catch would not hold the strap and it fell off onto the couch. No fiddling would get it to hold the strap fitting.I am extremely disappointed with Amazon's customer service as they tried to fob me off to Fitbit rather than meet their legal requirements under Consumer legislation. They refused me a replacement and best I could achieve was a full refund.As a secondary example of amazon's terrible service to customers is the two additional straps I've ordered for the Sense are no longer required as amazon refused to replace the Fitbit, their solution is to demand over 50% of the purschase price of the straps to return them, the second one I have even received yet.Defintiely avoid this Fitbit Sense and purchase from amazon.I doubt they will publish this review because it is so damning of both Fitbit and Amazon!"", 'Had a few of these, first one would not connect (Ebay)., second had a faulty pixel (Amazon), so as headline, third time lucky.Bought for wife so she is really impressed, especially with Amazon doing the replacements / refunds.

And that's exactly what I got.The fitbit app is easily the best app I've used, it links with myfitnesspal to give me a real time calories in vs calories out (CICO) and the free trial of premium means I also have easily digestable articles and recipes to support my weight loss.I love that there are so many faces to choose from and you can design your own in a separate app. The EDA stress tracker with guided meditation is also excellent if you can take 2 minutes a day for some mindful breathing and meditation.Is it worth the extra £100 over the Versa 3? I'm still not sure. After a month I think I've used the ecg maybe 3 times and the skin temperature is useful only because I have a neurological condition that's affected by my body temperature and I'm hoping it will give me an early warning before flare ups.

Dentro de los monitores también representa uno de los más baratos y con el diseño más lindo. Cambié al fitbit Sense, pues mi monitor anterior, el Versa, dejó de funcionar. Ese es el único tema con el que me he enfrentado con la marca Fitbit; sus devices no me duran más de 2 años, y encuentro que no son tan impermeables como se presume, pues cada que dejan de funcionarme es porque nadé con ellos varios días (en mar, albercas, cenotes). Me parece que el Sense podría ser distinto al no tener botones como tal, sino un tipo de sensor que funciona como lo hacían éstos y así no hay manera de que se cuele agua en el monitor.Me parece también que el soporte técnico es muy bueno, pues como lo conté en las líneas anteriores, mis devices dejaban de funcionar y fitbit se encargaba de apoyarme e incluso enviarme nuevos monitores. Esto es lo que más me ha convencido de la marca; están comprometidos con el usuario.Dentro de los assets adicionales que Fitbit tiene; hay rutinas de ejercicio que puedes ver desde el monitor o la app del celular; tiene foros de discusión; cuenta con una versión premium para tener acceso a contenidos para cuidar tu salud, más entrenamientos, etc (yo no la he usado)En cuanto a sus funciones; El Sense trae nuevos assets: medición de temperatura en sueño, medición del estrés, a partir de tocar con la palma entera el monitor durante un minuto. Sesiones de meditación o respiración. Rutinas de ejercicio, métricas promedio de todos tus signos vitales; consejos para mejorarlos. erc,La batería me está durando un poco más que el sense, siendo que no estoy registrando todos mis entrenamientos, por lo que mi uso es muy pasivo.

Mis entrenamientos no se trackean automáticamente, tengo que activar la función de manera manual, cuando antes no tenía que hacerlo en el Versa, el monitor lo identificaba solo. Si lo comparo con monitores como Garmin, me parece que fitbit es mucho más amigable y es para personas como yo, que no somos atletas pero cuidamos mucho nuestro cuerpo y estamos al pendiente de nuestras funciones vitales. En el caso de Samsung, estos son excelentes monitores, pero tienen un precio mayor y te atan a tener un celular de su marca, de Apple ni hablo, porque es una grosería lo que cuestan y no son tan exactos.Espero les haya ayudado mi reseña.', 'The most amazing watch, worth every penny.

The Amazfit is a good watch but I found it a little too clunky.....I have very small wrists.

It did look better and the Display was much brighter that my Amazfit, and I liked that it had a Sp02 monitor.  However, I was disappointed with this watch.  First of all, the display would just randomly fade in and out and sometimes the swiping action would not work....It took me 3 min one time to change the watch face.  And the watch faces are all made for round faces and look kind of funny on a square watch.  Also the Sp02 monitoring was not accurate....it was constantly giving me low readings.  I think the other measurements were fairly accurate, but I didn't keep the watch long enough to thoroughly test those out.  The other negative thing about this watch is that it was very difficult to navigate its options....not at all intuitive.  I ended up getting the Amazfit GTS 2 mini which is nicer looking, works much better and is so much easier to use, at almost half the price.....there is no comparison.

If youre looking solely for a fitness tracking watch, this leaves a lot to be desired.You can view message previews, get call alerts and set alarms. Music can only be controlled if you are using the phones defult music player not a streaming service (spotify, audible, ect.)Fitness tracking is limited to the modes listed in the description and there is no defult general workout mode. Heart rate is inaccurate, even when worn above the wrist bone as directed. The step counter works like a normal pedometer so any rapid arm movement or jumping counts as a step.In my case i walked 700 steps in a 20min drive.GPS also seemed to have trouble working out distance.For those with sensitive skin keep in mind it comes with a silicone band.

LOVE IT!', ""It is inevitable that most smart watches (this one included) will be compared to 'that' brand-name watch and that is simply not fair. What this watch does, it does it well. While not mind-blowingly so, it does it at a fraction of the cost. It's design is simple and unobtrusive yet stylish. You can wear this with practically anything and it won't look off. It is light and comfortable to wear and I easily sleep with it on, something I find hard to do with other watches.Screen:The screen is well-designed screen with easy to understand menus and very bright colors to help you see the different functions and status of each one in particular. It’s really cool. The display of the BPM is large and colors indicate the levels of intensity of your work out. I think the colors of each menu are a great help to understand your activities and goals in a clear visual way.I wore it overnight a couple of times to see what the sleep tracker reported. Interesting to see that I really do sleep as soundly as I thought!I bought this primarily as a fitness tracker to help track my heart rate when I’m on the treadmill. As a test I measured my resting heart rate with a pulse ox monitor, my phone and the Watch1 and the results were all very consistent. Additionally, comparing my mileage against my phone and as measured on the treadmill the results are again very consistent. I like that it has a reminder to get up and get moving thru out the day. I don’t think I realized exactly how long I tend to sit at my desk during the work day.All in all a great watch/fitness tracker, especially for the price. Would recommend without reservation.Added bonus, it looks great! First time I wore it out in public the very first person that saw it commented on my new slick watchBattery life is good, I haven’t made it to 10 days, 7 days seems more like it but since this is my first fitness tracker I think I tend to check it more frequently than normal. I’ve run it down to around 10% charge, connected it to the charger and been back to 100% in a couple of hours. Main take-away here is that I don’t have to worry with charging it every single night.To say that this watch is packed with features would be an understatement and all this managed by a very intuitive app. I love it, especially when you consider you're getting all this for that shockingly low price! I would heartily recommend this to anyone.Again, it's an incredible value, but if I want to be nit picky, here is what I would say needs improvement:1. Display doesn't go all the way to the edge.2. Notifications. As I noted, it only displays texts and calls, nothing else. Wish it gave my Ring and email notices too.3. Music. It only controls tracks, not volume. No music storage. Personally, I always wear ear buds when I exercise, but I hate bringing my phone. Having music storage would be nice.4. Display doesn't have an always-on option. I know that it would really bite into battery life, but I wish I had the option to have always-on display in lieu of longer battery life."", 'This product is amazing. Easy connectivity - it took no longer than a couple of minutes to connect and set up the app. The watch tracks all the vital data ie steps, calories and distance travelled.

You can also receive notification on the watch, from messages to emails. Highly recommend!', ""Arrived quickly. Light weight, and comfortable. I have small wrists and it still fits comfortably.

I like the size and based on the options and features would have expected it to cost a lot more.  My only downside is the size of the font when getting txt message alerts and the inability to change the sedentary reminder to 45mins but that's not a deal-breaker either.

For running, Heart Rate, Charts the breakdown of the run is incorrect showing most of the time in Fat Burning and Warm up where as the watch correctly show Extreme, Anaerobic & Aerobic time missing from the Health App.  Why even when fully synced this critical data is incorrect in the Health App?Will test with an updated version of the Health App.  Google Play for some reason are distributing an older version??Huawei support were very helpful and very fast to respond and offer assistance but have no solid solutions. Subsequent use has exposed further serious bugs and limitations widely reported but apparently unresolved by Huawei technical support.']"
Ticwatch E3 Smart Watch Wear OS by Google Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100 Platform Health Monitor Fitness Tracker GPS NFC IP68 Waterproof iOS/Android Compatible ,https://www.amazon.com.au/Ticwatch-Qualcomm-Snapdragon-Waterproof-Compatible/dp/B0953PW1MD,"[""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Ticwatch E3 ticks most of the boxes when it comes to features. Minimalist design with latest snapdragon 4100 at a budget friendly price. From step counting to O2 level monitoring this watch is packed with features. Silicon strap that comes with the watch is good quality. Even though the watch feels a bit bulky at 12.6mm, it is very comfortable to wear. I haven't tried all the workout modes but normal step counting, sleep tracking seems to work fine.Snap 4100 chip paired with 1gb ram makes the watch work without any issues. I haven't faced a single lag yet. Battery seems to last good with 24hr Heartrate and O2 level monitoring, fully charged last day and after 20 hrs of normal usage still got 40% left.Calls can be answered straight from the watch and the speaker is loud enough for an indoor environment. Mic quality is decent no one complained about my voice being distorted or too low.LCD display is one of the drawbacks of the watch but it is sharp and colours are good. Sunlight legibility is not an issue but the brightness needs to be increased manually since there is no ambient light sensor present. Double click on the top button increases the brigntess to maximinum for a small amount of time which helps under direct sunlight.Overall for the price this watch is very good. Considering the fact that Google will be releasing the wear OS 3.0 in early 2022, Ticwatch E3 will be one of the watches to get it."", 'Design and Build:-impressive design , stylish frame, which makes the watch look amazing, has a good build and light weight but there’s one flaw that it’s design makes its screen extremely prominent to damage while use .Features and OS:- The google wear OS works very fine on this beautiful watch along with its connectivity features ( nfc, Bluetooth,wifi), first watch I have seen with Google pay at this price point, it makes payment convenient efficiently. Watch faces offered by Mobvoi are a big bonus😍.It has many workout modes, I have tried 4 of those and they worked out pretty accurate with your workout and health details. It has swim workout tracker that is a very extraordinary feature as it lets your track your activity and health details while swimming( so amazing 🤯 ). It can even track your sleep 😴.Battery and charging:- The charging speed of this watch is impressive( it charges at an amazing speed). Battery life is good, lasts 2 days on normal mode but it drains very quick while tracking any workout or if you use it while connected to wifi.CONCLUSION:- an all rounder attractive looking smartwatch with an extremely affordable price tag. There are some minor flaws though, but they can be ignored by that extremely affordable and competitive price tag. Rest everything about this watch is beautiful.💯💯💯', ""Honestly a great all round budget smart watch, if you're worried about future proof of this watch, no need to. The snap dragon 4100 built into this watch is more than capable of scrolling through the apps and notifications super smoothly. Was very surprised of the performance. With Samsung and Google's collaboration this year, wear os (the operating system) is due to get a revamp which has already been confirmed for this watch, which I can't wait for. The battery life is OK... If you have a watch face that doesn't show too much you'll have more than a day of use. Style of this watch is one thing I was kinda disappointed about. The big bezzels are distracting to the eye as well... But if you're looking for a smart watch that does everything a $400 Samsung watch 4 does, and your on a budget? This is a pretty damn good option for the price."", 'This definitely is the coolest smartwatch I’ve owned so far.Looks - 5 stars - I’ve always admired watches with a round dial against the square, rectangle ones.It was easy to set-up. Really cool watch faces available and can be changed with a single tap and is updated within seconds.Looking forward to set-up Google pay and use other features such as being able to respond to texts and taking calls from the watch.Very reasonably priced keeping in mind the features it offers in comparison to other brands. Will definitely recommend.', 'Bought this watch, arrived on time, maybe not my lucky day.. :(. Sadly my wife not very happy when she saw green vertical lines on the lcd screen after she switched On.We end up to return it back and choose another brand instead.']"

It works well, and Im pleased with the data it provides. The app useful and informative, but it is annoying to have to keep going between ""device"" and ""health"" tabs to do different things, which I suppose is how they organise it to cater to people with multiple devices. It just makes it more troublesome for those like me with only one. The reason I give tyhe product and overall 2, however, is because os the unforgivable app permissions. The app outright cannot be used without putting in my personal phone number, so that it can confirm who I am. Why the F does it need to know who I am? And given this is Huawei we are talking about, you\'d think they\'d know better than to go sticking their nose into people\'s privacy. The app also continually asks for permissions that it doesnt need, and it keeps asking and asking. I will never give in; I just say no every time. So, great device, if you dont mind the mindset of the the company, which wants to know ALL about you.', ""This smart watch is great. You can change your watch faces by downloading via the Huawei health app. There are 96 workout modes to choose from. You can check your pulse, amount and quality of sleep, oxygen levels, stress levels. It has a cute reminder cartoon which tells you to get up and move around. It displays the weather. You can read text messages sent to your mobile, but can't reply using the watch. It also has the ability to let you reject calls (but not answer them). It has a stopwatch, timer and alarm. I am very happy with the quality of this watch."", ""Not the best but great. I find the size being the down side because it's designed to fit both male and female. It really doesn't and especially you're a more slim or petit female it really wouldn't fit nicely. The watch face part and where it bends over your wrist is too long. So if you have thick bone or thick wrist it's great. Otherwise it's not."", ""While it's pretty and comfortable... it doesn't work accurately at all. Measured against medical equipment often, the data was wildly off. According to the watch I was at 81% oxygen in my blood... official testing at the time said 99%, that quite the difference. Watch said my heartrate was 105, medical testing said 62... another huge difference. Said I was asleep an hour before I even tried to get to sleep. There is no point to buying this for health monitoring. It's just a pretty watch."", 'Huawei has done justice to this product. it does what it say from monitoring heart rate, sleep and distance etc.the most what I liked its the battery life. it gave me 6 days on a full charge. I have Samsung Gear 2 which only lasted a day, with notification may be half day. I got 6 days with notifications which is very impressive.I would have given a 5 star rating but the charging of the band is not as per the description, it has a separate charger, I would have like if it was like Band 4 - USB type as it would be easier to charge if battery goes low at work.apart from that I would recommend this band any time. its the best on the market at very good price.', ""I've been using it for about 1 week and overall it was a good buy for an entry-level health band.  It does lack some of the key features of the more expensive alternatives.Pros:-Has 24hr heart rate monitor (simpler version) and customisable-SPO2 measurement-A reasonably detailed sleep tracker-Integrated GPS-Aesthetically pleasingCons:-The heart monitor doesn't have heart rate variability (HRV) which is used to measure stress levels. If that's important to you, don't buy it.-Integrated GPS uses a lot of battery. If you have 24/7 Heart rate turned on and GPS and notifications, the battery will last 3 days max.-requires wifi for the app to analyse the data which is strange? (not sure if this is standard)-There may be a privacy issue given it requires wifi when it probably shouldn't.So if you just want to try a health band this is a good buy but if you are serious about detailed measurement to improve your health or monitor your condition, this is not the right item for you, go for a 200+ dollar smartwatch."", 'I have waited 1 month before reviewing this product,For the price this is an amazing product, i get around 10-12 days battery life with this watch (amazing).The USB charging is a great idea, no need to buy anything additional.I have a large hand, so it looks nice and small for my hand. However those with a small hand may find it slightly bulky.Great Buy 100% Recommend', 'I have another Huawei watch (man size) which I received when I bought my phone.  Love that one but it is big and a bit heavy.  This one is so much lighter and with more features and is so much more comfortable for sleep tracking.  Can hardly wait until I can buy a Velcro band for it but the silicon one is quite comfortable for the moment.', ""HUAWEI Band 4 Pro, Built-in GPS, Workout Guidance - Pink GoldI deliberated for a while about getting a fitness tracker for running. I wanted to be able to see my route with a reliable GPS, heart rate monitor and sleep analysis. It was very easy to set up following the instructions. There is a detailed manual under the help menu on the app. I was very impressed with the GPS. Selected outdoor run and it locked onto me in 3 seconds and then mapped the route perfectly. Great post run analytics with graphs of heart rate, pace and cadence that overlay each other as an option. Tried the option for outdoor walk for mowing the lawn but this didn't work so well (the map was out a bit) but I didn't really expect it to. Some options are listed on the app but not part of the device (e.g., climbing of stairs, stress). The sleep measure is perhaps a little inaccurate saying I'm dreaming when I'm actually still getting back to sleep. The app gives handy tips though for improving sleep quality. Lastly, the look of it is really stylish. I have a narrow wrist and was worried it would look bulky but it has heaps of holes in the band so fits perfectly and I've had lots of comments on how good it looks."", 'I was looking for a watch with some basic functions of my exercise needs. I did quite a few researches on Fitbit, Garmin and then finally selected this one. This watch covers most of the functions that other types of watch got: heart rate, oxygen rate, types of workout and even message review function.  i have an iphone, and i can still receiving phone calls from this watch and decline the phone call. Will try the GPS function for the outdoor running. but definitely, this watch is very recommended to buy.', 'I got my Huawei Band Pro 4 exactly one week ago. During this week, I was trying a little bit of everything. It has a nice design, it’s easy to navigate, the app also has no secrets, the display is also good, GPS track also worked very well, and the sleep monitoring is very interesting with good suggestions to improve the quality of sleep.However, I am disappointed about the battery, which I had to charge FOUR TIMES in one week. I understand that using some tools would require a bit more of my battery, but I used my GPS only once in a 3 hours bike ride, I turned of notifications ao notifications, checked oxygen levels only twice and other than that I used it only to check the hours. I would understand if I had to charge it twice during this week because of the 3 hours activity with GPS, but no 4 times. That’s too much.Another thing that I didn’t like, but no really relevant, is that I have only 3 options for the background of its screen.', 'Love the features and different workout features available in this band and the price is really good. Very sleak, stylish and a true work-out companion. Seamless connectivity with both iOs and Android. However, please download the latest version of Huawei Health App from Huawei App Gallery.', ""The phone interface is easy to use and efficient. It connects through bluetooth and doesn't require the internet to transfer data. The many free watch faces are attractive and there is something to suit everyone. I have mine synced to my Huawei phone and all notifications come through the watch. It's so good for the price!"", 'I just got it and so disappointing with the battery life. I  am just using this watch because my skin seems to be ok with it. I am yet to experience skin burns like my previous watch. This seems to be the only advantage.For a watch cost almost 100$, i never expected the battery life to be such a disaster.', 'I use it a few times a week and the battery lasts and lasts. I only count steps, distance walked and heart beats per minute but I am sure I will start to use the few other features it has. You do need a magnifying glass to read it whilst out and about. The app on my phone works OK.', ""Never thought of using huawei but give it a try, you wont regret it.Battery last 7days with 10% leftScreen is great, quality band, tracking is spot on, sleep track does what its meant too.I've compared them all and the only comes close is fitbit."", ""Great watch! Was a little tricky figuring out the apps and setting it up, but eventually got there. Was a great gift for my sister. The band 4 wasn't listed on the device list of bluetooth when setting up, I'm still not sure why it eventually worked, but it did! An hour later :)"", 'Would not fit band to small! Mighty ape your supplier will not accept return as package has been opened . Not impressed!', ""I think this is a great prodcut but be aware, if you register the app with a non-chinese mobile phone, you won't get the watch face store"", 'Nothing to dislike, works as well as could be wished and the SpO2 feature is a pleasant bonus. The battery life is surprisingly good, 5 or 6 days, even with the Heart rate monitor running all day.']"
