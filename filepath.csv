"Garmin Venu 2, GPS Fitness Smartwatch, Slate Stainless Steel Bezel with Black Band ",https://www.amazon.com.au/Garmin-Fitness-Smartwatch-Slate-Stainless/dp/B091ZXYQXF,"[""Overall this is a great fitness watch.  It has a range of activies to choose from including run, walk, strength, cardio, (pool) swim (I think you'd need a higher spec for ocean swim), yoga, pilates and many more!It's easy to access all the menus using buttons on the side of the watch or swiping the watch face.The watch links seemlessly to your smartphone via the Garmin Connect app where you can upload all of your workouts and monitor progress at a glance.  You can track your goals, monitor heartrate and stress levels and you can even sign up for a personlised coach to take you to your first 5km, 10km or half marathon.The watch is lightweight and looks good enough that you could wear it all day.  It has a range of features designed to negate the need for carrying cards/ phone, like Garmin Pay - add bank cards to the Garmin Connect app and away you go!The watch also has the capacity to upload about 500 songs using Spotify, Amazon or other music apps and listen to them via bluetooth headphones. With phones getting bigger & heavier, who wants to carry them on your walk / run??The main reason I gave it 4 stars, not 5 was due to how hard it was to sort out the music.After synching my Spotify playlist + bluetooth headphones, I did a trial and every time I started the running app, my headphones disconnected!  After about 20 attempts and a lot of Google searching, I was able to remedy the issue, but it involved a full reset.  GRR!In my case it's because the headphones actually have a heartrate monitor in them and this was interfering with the watch's HRM.  If you have standard bluetooth earbuds, you might not have this issue.Now that I've got everything working, it really is a great watch that I enjoy using and I would highly recommend it.The price point makes it a lot more affordable than some other smart watches with similar features."", ""Beautiful looking display, but boy where's the rest of it? There's a 3mm ring of black nothing around the tiny 31mm display wasted. My old Ticwatch E (on the left in photo) is the same size watch, but it's display is much bigger.I haven't used much of the software yet, but I'm not mad on the GUI (Graphical User Interface). Thinking of returning it due to the display. Doesn't connect to my Oppo Find X2 Pro either."", 'The watch gives enough data with much better accuracy to track my daily activities and health status. The stress, sleep, and heart metrics have a higher accuracy rate.  It gives you the trend which can be interpreted according to individual.The battery life is awesome. I charge only once a week.Garmin Connect app could have a bit better.Overall this is a perfect daily use alternate smartwatch for Apple & FitBit. I loved it.', 'I bought this to monitor my sleep apart from normal activities, after a month use, I can recommend it to others. Initially, the body battery was going a bit unusual but it improved itself with time. Watch size is good for thin wrists as well. In Australia, the product price was too much so I bought it from Amazon Uk with a very competitive price, but I had to wait for a couple of week for the delivery, so be ready to wait a long time if you order from outside Australia. Lastly, the battery life is around 5-6 days, but if you use it to listen to music then get ready to charge it frequently. Overall a very good fitness watch.', ""Functions well (3rd day), power runs down quicker than expected, but probably would last six days, if not using it.  If you don't look at the screen the power will last longer.  Easily connected with my phone.  I was able to connect with my speed/cadence on my bike with no problems.  Also used in the pool for swimming."", 'Really think that Garmin has a good product in the Venu.  I understand the battery life has also been improved on the Venu 2 - which from my perspective in using the Venu now for a few weeks is a necessary thing!  Love the music and Pay functions but have reservations with use of the Golf function.  This is perhaps the only let down point as the Golf shot tracking is overly sensitive and logs shots of 0 metres on just about every hole.  These can be deleted later on with editing - but as I\'m tracking shots and club distances - this is now impacting on accuracy of measurements.  Hope this can be fixed with software tweak??  Garmin??  Other than this ""First World"" issue - a great all around activity tracking smart watch!', 'I had a Fitbit before this. Sleep monitoring is terrible in comparison - no idea when I’m awake vs light sleep. I’ll need to read instructions to do anything other than view data, it’s not especially intuitive. GPS takes a while to load before exercise and today it didn’t even know where I was, came up with a route I didn’t take! I suspect distance, pace, steps and VO2max more accurate than FitBit though - they are more conservative. Not unhappy with it, but not as happy as I expected to be ‘upgrading’ from a 3-4 year old Fitbit.', 'I wanted to love this watch as I was upgrading from a previous model. However I ended up getting a faulty unit because whenever I charged the watch as soon as it came off the charger it went dead. Every single time. It would then take me 20-30 minutes of trying multiple reset to get it to turn back on. I put up with it for almost a month until I finally have up and sent it back.', 'I am an ex Samsung Smart watch user. I recently switched to Garmin after my Samsung died out.  I bought this watch 1 and half week ago. I charged the watch as soon as I received it.  After fully charged the battery lasted for 7 days.  Compare this to the Samsung watch which needed charging every single day. The watch does everything a smart watch does and I am very pleased with it.I am in love with my new watch.', 'Have been using this Venu SQ Garmin for the last 3 months - it is an awesome health and fitness tracker but I do feel it can improve slightly on tracking sleep - but everything else is really great!', ""I have moved from a fairly simple Fitbit Charge 2 watch to this one, so I had great expectations. Being a golfer the golf app was something I was keen to use and was not disappointed. I am just starting to get a full understanding of how this watch works, but for now I'm very happy with it."", ""I bought this watch to replace a Samsung Active2 watch. The Samsung was very stylish but HR was inaccurate and it doesn't measure spo2. The Garmin has worked perfectly. The app is not as good as STEALTH, but overall I much prefer the Garmin."", 'The watch was really good but the screen stopped working in less than a month. Had to return it and buy a another one.', 'We bough this for my boss who has increased her fitness last year for her to track her workouts and reach her goals.  She absolutely loves it and recommends it to anyone looking for a product like this.', ""Brought it as a birthday present my wife loves the look and functionality and know doesn't know what it was like with out it."", 'I love my new watch. It provides me with all I data I need to track my goals, gains and health. Excellent cost vs benefits.', 'Looks great and my husbands now has no reason to complain that he is tired as watch shows ‘sleep scores’. Pretty amazing.', 'Bought the  Garmin for my wife.. We both had Polar sport watches, which kept failing to charge..My wife loves her new Garmin.  No complaints at all. !', 'It does everything as advertised. Great for the price. The OLED screen is nice. Battery lasts about two days.', 'Looks good on the website site but the software is like a toy watch. Disappointed purchase.', 'bought for my better half for Christmas, she has nothing but praise, cannot fault it.', ""It's amazing very happy."", 'Wonderful product and very accurate description', 'buttons would not work!!!!', 'no', 'Value for money. Working excellent', 'I owned several watches and this is my favourite. I owned a FitBit, a Polar Ignite an Apple Watch Series 3 and now this.This Garmin is a fitness tracker with some smart watch features. It does what a fitness tracker tends to do, i.e., track steps, heart rate, distance travelled and has GPS so you don’t need to bring the phone with you. It has some extra tracking features like stress tracking and period tracking. I am going to make a quick comparison with the other watches.Sleep tracking. For me the FitBit, Apple Watch and Polar Ignite all had better sleep tracking. The Garmin Venu SQ has issues with detecting when you wake up and when you fall asleep. There was a night where I got up for a few minutes and the Garmin did not register that as being awake. It might be a fit issue as sometimes it’s more accurate than others.So Garmin Venu Sq loses on the sleep tracking.Sport Tracking.It’s almost on par with the Ignite. You can view your training load with the Ignite (on the Polar website), whereas with the Garmin you can’t. Although it shows you your weekly average of activity, albeit it isn’t quite the same thing. Garmin has a few built-in walking/running/cycling challenges, akin to those of Strava, which the Ignite does not have. I haven’t used the coaching features on the watches so I can’t comment as I find them limiting and they are good for generic strength training or running. I follow my own programs.The Garmin app lets you make a note of exercises and reps, although if an exercise is missing you can’t add it to the app.The Garmin app notifies you with insights, like how many times you have hit your step goal, and it has a function to increase it automatically if you wish to. It also gives you badges for hitting activity milestones, which is more similar to what the Apple Watch does. They both attempt to gamify exercise somewhat whereas the Polar is serious business. The FitBit has activity and step tracking, but trying to view your routes is hidden behind a subscription. For the other Watches you don’t pay any extra for this.The Apple Watch default fitness app lets you track distance, steps, heart rate like the other watches and also offers trend insights. No built-in training load like this Garmin.Garmin Venu SW sport tracking is pretty good. It depends on what you look for in your sport tracking, but if training load is essential (without having to pay for third party apps), then the Ignite just inches ahead.“Health Tracking”I put it in quotes because all these watch companies add these features and then say they are not health features. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) tracking is done differently on all these devices.I prefer the Garmin and the Polar way. Polar tracks your HRV overnight and tells you if you are recovered the next day (together with sleep data). Garmin does it throughout the day, through a system called Body Battery. It uses HRV with other information to tell you whether you are stressed (physiologically or mentally) or whether you are resting during the day. It was able to detect when I was highly stressed after an argument and even sent me an alert in that case. It makes you aware of correlations between how you feel and what you did that might have caused it.For example, I had an ice cream fairly late in the evening. I thought I slept okay because I didn’t remember waking up but I didn’t feel rested. When I looked at the Body Battery I noticed that it wasn’t until 3/4 am that my body had actually started recovering. Given that I didn’t fall asleep any later than usual I wouldn’t have made the connection with the ice cream, but we ain’t having that in the evening anymore.HRV tracking on the FitBit requires subscription.HRV Tracking on the Apple Watch is not reliable. It tries to take readings when it sees you are relaxed or sleeping, an they are very short samples. With 3rd party apps and the use of Apple’s own Breathe app you can force readings and analyse them properly, but the Apple Watch at the moment is just a bit lacklustre in this department.So for HRV Polar and Garmin are a tie and the approach you have to HRV will be the deciding factor on who wins.Cycle tracking. They all do it quite well aside from the Ignite, which doesn’t have it at all. It’s quite a big omission for women, as it absolutely influences the way I train. It’s one of the main drivers of how I feel through the month. The Garmin also lets you add some extra notes, and not just some preset symptoms. so Garmin Venu Sq wins this one.Food TrackingFitBit wins this one as it has food tracking built in.Polar Ignite does not have it at all.Both Garmin Venu Sq and Apple Watch require and integrate with third party apps. The Venu however only works with MyFitnessPal.Pulse OximetryThe Apple Watch Series 3 and the Ignite don’t have it. The FitBit Versa 3 (which is of comparable price if I recall correctly) has it and so does this Garmin. That said, pulse ox on watches are unreliable, so you might as well not use it.Battery LifeFitBit and Garmin have similar battery life. Up to 5/6 days. The Ignite has around 3 1/2 and the Apple Watch Series 3 has 18 hours. I really love not having to charge my Garmin every day.Smart Watch FeaturesThe Apple Watch here wins by a mile. Many apps, granular control over notifications, Siri.Fitbit depends on what you buy, but even the cheap FitBits let you choose which app can send notifications to your phone. I haven’t seen the FitBit app store but I hear it has a limited amount of apps.Garmin Venu Sq has the ability to choose between phone notifications, message notifications and app notifications, but you can’t choose which apps. You can also turn off notifications during activity. It has access to a store but like the FitBit it has limited apps.The Ignite is only a sport watch. No apps and notifications are an all or nothing affair.ScreenI didn’t own a comparable FitBit so I can’t comment. The Apple Watch Screen is my favourite. The Garmin’s screen is decent but smaller. I really do not like the Ignite’s screen, it’s not very responsive.CONCLUSIONSo all in all, the Garmin Venu Sq is a jack of all trade watch that does most things decently and some quite well. The only other watch that has better flexibility is the Apple Watch Series 3, which is slightly more expensive and  has worse battery life. If you don’t have an iPhone the Apple Watch is out of the equation.Given it’s all around capabilities, how good Body Battery is, how the app presents the information in a way that is easy to make correlations and the longer battery life, the Garmin Venu Sq is my choice at this price range and I recommend it. Whilst the FitBit has good “health” tracking capabilities you have to pay extra for things like HRV tracking, so again the Garmin wins here.', ""Moin!=========Update=========Soooooo. Wir zwei haben nun eine ganze Weile miteinander verbracht. Sonst habe ich sehr gern meine Samsung Galaxy Watch getragen. Und? Ich habe mehrere Monate komplett drauf verzichtet. Das lag vor allem aber daran, dass mir der Smartwatch-Anteil eine lange Zeit nicht fehlte. Da überwog einfach der Wunsch nach einem Fitnesstracker. Der Bereich ist hier für mich auch weiterhin einfach überragend. Der Plan zum Joggen passt sich immer wieder individuell an und ist höflich zu mir, wenn mich dann doch mal über Wochen die Faulheit am Sofa festhält. Erstaunlicherweise funktioniert das Tracken hier tadellos und irgendwie scheinen die Satelliten sonst einen relativ großen Bogen um unser Gebiet zu machen. 😉 Zwischenzeitlich war ich für einige Wochen zu meiner Galaxy Watch zurückgekehrt. Warum? Hier ist einfach das Aufladen zu nervig. Man muss dies zwar selten machen, muss dann aber bei bedarf ein Kabel an der Rückseite reinfriemeln, welches in meinen Augen dazu viel zu kurz ist. Jedes Mal krieche ich dafür halb hinters Sofa, da es auf der Armlehne nicht liegen bleiben möchte. Mittlerweile bin ich wieder bei der Garmin, das Wetter passt und der Bewegungsdrang ist wieder da.Wer keine Smartwatch sucht, sondern einen Fitnesstracker, der ist hier absolut richtig! Auch nach längerer Nutzung und so einigen Updates würde ich diese Uhr noch immer nicht als Smartwatch bezeichnen. Nicht sehr smart aber viel watch und noch mehr Fitnesstracker.Ursprüngliche Rezension:Dies ist nicht meine erste Smartwatch. Recht zu Beginn bin ich 2014 mit der Moto360 von Motorola eingestiegen und dann 2016 auf die Moto360 2nd Gen. umgestiegen. Bei der Motorola war ich von Beginn an sehr begeistert vom Betriebssystem. Die Uhr war zwar nicht sehr eigenständig, hat jedoch alles gespiegelt, was auf dem Handy passierte. Nur leider hat Motorola nie ein schönes Design geschaffen und so bin ich dann 2018 auf die Samsung Galaxy Watch umgestiegen. Hier gabs dann eine wirklich großartige Optik, aber eine sehr begrenzte Funktionalität als Spiegel des Handys. Die Abteilung Sport war bei der Galaxy Watch schon recht ausgeprägt, nur leider hatte die Uhr bei mir beim Joggen immer Probleme mit dem GPS. Und nun? Eine Smartwatch von Garmin, die schon in der Werbung ein brillantes Display verspricht und noch dazu aussieht wie eine normale Uhr? Na dann mal los! 😉Diese Rezension wird vorlaufend weiterentwickelt, da die Uhr erst mit der Zeit zeigen wird, was sie alles kann.=========Design=========Die Uhr hat ein recht schlichtes Design und erinnert mich stark an die Samsung Galaxy Watch. Sie besteht komplett aus Plastik und hat eine optisch abgesetzte Lünette. Das Display ist leicht erhaben, was in meinen Augen der Garant dafür ist, dass man damit früher oder später irgendwo hängen bleibt und so ein Sprung droht. Ich habe mir jedoch bereits eine Schutzfolie bestellt und hoffe, dass so Schlimmeres verhindert wird. Das mitgelieferte Armband ist aus Gummi und riecht recht stark, lässt sich jedoch sehr simpel gegen ein anderes Armband tauschen. Rechts am Gehäuse befinden sich zwei Knöpfe.Im Vergleich zu anderen Smartwatches ist dieses Model doch recht leicht.=========Features=========Direkt von Anfang an zeigt sich, wofür diese Uhr eigentlich gedacht ist. Für mich zeigt sich diese Smartwatch weniger als Smartwatch, denn eher als Fitnesstracker. Es mag sein, dass ich in den Einstellungen noch nicht das Richtige gefunden habe, aber die Benachrichtigung vom Handy funktioniert entweder stark verzögert oder gar nicht.-Wecker – Ich habe einen leichten Schlaf und habe mich bei meiner Galaxy Watch daran gewöhnt, mich lediglich mittels Vibrationsalarm morgens wecken zu lassen. Dies funktioniert auch mit diesem Model wirklich großartig.-Werte im Alltag checken – Die Uhr konzentriert sich den ganzen Tag auf meine Bewegungsabläufe, Puls, gelaufene Schritte und lustigerweise auch mein Stresslevel. Erstaunlicherweise macht sie das auch wirklich gut. So bekam ich in einer mehr als nervenaufreibenden Vorlesung plötzlich die Info „Ihr Stresslevel ist zu hoch“. Das spiegelte in dem Moment genau mein Gefühl wieder! 😉-Sport – Das werde ich die Tage auf jeden Fall testen. Bei schlechtem Wetter finde ich einfach zu viele Ausreden.=========Funktionalität=========Der Akku macht bislang einen sehr guten Eindruck. Nicht wie bei anderen Smartwatches, muss diese Uhr nicht jeden Abend auf die Station. Da sind wir aber schon bei einem Problem. Statt die Uhr einfach auf eine Ladestation zu legen, darf man bei diesem Gerät einen Stecker in die Uhr frickeln, in meinen Augen nicht sehr zeitgemäß, das geht auf jeden Fall besser!Des Weiteren zeigt diese Uhr teilweise eine doch recht schwache Performance.  Die Smartwatch verliert immer wieder die Verbindung zum Handy oder es wird mir auf dem Handy eine Fehlermeldung angezeigt, dass die Android Benachrichtigung beendet wurde, was jedes Mal den Neustart meines Handys verlangt. Auch scheint der RAM-Speicher bei dieser Uhr nicht ausreichend zu sein, so wirkt die Bedienung oft ruckelig und es treten Latenzprobleme auf. Das Touchdisplay ist nicht sehr sensibel und so darf man öfter mehrmals wischen, ehe man das gewünschte Ergebnis erzielt. Ein kleiner Tipp am Rande. Nicht die App „Sleep with Android“ runterladen. Bei dieser App stürzt bei mir die Uhr jedes Mal ab und wünscht einen Neustart.Alles in Allem ist die Menüführung nicht sehr intuitiv, nicht innovativ und arg ruckelig. Die Smartwatch läuft ordentlich, da ist jedoch noch sehr viel Luft nach Oben.Ich hoffe, meine Rezension war Ihnen behilflich. 😊 Vielen Dank für's Lesen."", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Questa è la mia prima esperienza con Garmin, ho avuto in passato sempre altri smart e sportwatch, (fitbit, huawei, huami, amazfit e xiaomi) e questo Venu SQ è stata una bella sorpresa.Avevo bisogno di un prodotto che monitorasse la corsa in modo efficace e questo smartwatch è perfetto sotto ogni punto di vista senza dover spendere un capitale. Premetto quindi che questa mia recensione tiene in considerazione solo la corsa e non gli altri sport.Elencherò in modo sintetico cosa mi è piaciuto e cosa no:✅ E' molto elegante, abbastanza discreto, sta bene su qualsiasi polso ed è talmente leggero che non ci si accorge di averlo al polso. Utilizzato anche per dormire non da assolutamente fastidio.✅ Il display sfrutta la tecnologia LCD, ha una risoluzione di 240x240 px e non ha always on. Pensavo che questo sarebbe stato un problema ed invece lo schermo si vede benissimo in qualsiasi condizione, sembra di avere uno schermo oled, e la gesture per l'attivazione dello schermo è precisa, non sbaglia mai un colpo, veramente ottimo !!! Anche se lo schermo è piccolo rispetto ad altri smartwatch che ho avuto in passato si vede tutto benissimo.✅ Il sensore cardio è molto preciso e legge in modo veloce le variazioni, cosa estremamente utile nello sport. E' possibile impostare una lettura H24 con modalità intelligente oppure continua (ogni secondo). Queste impostazioni possono essere settate o da app oppure direttamente nell'orologio. E' possibile impostare degli avvisi di frequenza alta o bassa durante l'attività e anche durante la giornata intera. E' possibile disattivare il monitoraggio cardio H24.✅ Ha lettura dell'ossigenazione del sangue, SpO2, che può essere monitorata durante tutta la giornata oppure solo durante il sonno, oppure può essere disattivata e quindi la lettura può essere effettuata manualmente.✅ Il sensore GPS e veloce e preciso. Si può scegliere solo GPS, GPS + Glonass oppure GPS + Galileo. Tramite queste opzioni la triangolazione e quindi la traccia ottenuta è precisa e l'aggancio al satellite avviene in max 7 secondi.✅ Il monitoraggio della corsa è pressoché perfetto. Vi sono moltissime opzioni e parametri, è possibile aggiungere dei campi dati alla corsa, ogni schermata può essere modificata con i dati a proprio piacimento, c'è l'auto pausa, a corsa avviata è possibile modificare determinati parametri, insomma c'è tutto l'occorrente per anche il più esigente degli utenti. Fantastico !✅ E' presente anche un sistema di sicurezza di rilevazione incidenti, quindi se avviene una caduta viene mandato un messaggio di emergenza con la posizione GPS a determinati contatti preimpostati nell'app sul telefono. Ovvio che per usufruire di questa opzione è necessario avere con se il telefono.✅ E' possibile avviare un live track dell'attività sportiva svolta e condividerla con i propri contatti. In questo modo da remoto il vostro contatto potrà visualizzare in tempo reale la vostra attività. Anche in questo caso è necessario avere con se il telefono.✅ Finalmente uno smartwatch che opera veramente in multitasking. Se fate partire un'attività, tramite swipe a sisnitra, potrete tornare alla home e da li avere accesso a tutto i parametri, widget, app, ecc. dello smartwatch. La vostra attività rimarrà attiva in background. Potete inoltre ricevere anche ad attività avviata tutte le notifiche, impostazione settabile a proprio piacimento.✅ Cosa da non sottovalutare, questo smartwatch è affidabile ! Il software non si incarta, non lagga, il sistema operativo è ben studiato, funziona tutto alla grande.✅ Il punto forte di questo e di tutti i prodotti garmin è il software. Il migliore fino ad ora provato ! Garmin Connect gestisce in modo perfetto il sync tra orologio e telefono. Notifiche puntuali e precise, tra l'altro è possibile rispondere direttamente da orologio tramite messaggi preimpostati, e sync perfetto. L'app è veramente completa e ben fatta. E' possibile tramite garmin coach, avere degli allenamenti preimpostati oppure crearne nuovi a proprie esigenze. E' una funziona che non ho testato benissimo, ma è un valore aggiunto di non poco conto. Per aggiungere ulteriori funzionalità allo smartwatch, app, widget campi dati e watchface, bisogna scaricare un'altra app, uno store ogni giorno sempre più aggiornato chiamato Connect IQ, dalla quale è possibile aggiungere app e widget allo smartwatch, aggiungere e modificare watchface. Insomma, oltre ad avere un ottimo prodotto al polso è fondamentale avere un ottimo software a supporto e a mio avviso da questo punto di vista Garmin non ha rivali.✅ Durante la giornata viene monitorato lo stress e quindi viene calcolato il body battery, ovvero un'indicazione della carica energetica del vostro corpo, veramente utile per trovare il miglior periodo della giornata per effettuare un'attività. E' una funzione molto valida e utile, e funziona alla grande !!✅ E possibile controllare qualsiasi lettore audio in esecuzione sul telefono, quindi si può alzare il volume, play / pausa  e skip dei pezzi.✅ E' presente Garmin Pay, quindi associata la vostra carta di credito, potrete in tutta sicurezza effettuare pagamenti con il vostro smartwatch sfruttando la funzione contactless (NFC) integrata. Dovrete impostare una passkey che dovrete quindi inserire prima di effettuare il pagamento. Il sistema è super sicuro e funziona alla perfezione.✅ E' possibile settare sveglie, timer, aumentare o abbassare la luminosità automatica su 3 livelli (c'è un sensore automatico della luminosità che lavora in modo estremamente efficace e veloce), è possibile disattivare il Bluetooth (cosa non presente su nessun smartwatch che fino ad ora ho provato), ricercare il telefono e tutte le maggiori funzioni presenti in tutti questi device. E' possibile rispondere e/o rifiutare le chiamate in arrivo.✅ Il monitoraggio del sonno è preciso, vengono calcolati parametri quali sonno profondo, leggero e rem. Viene inoltre calcolato il numero delle volte che si respira ogni minuto (anche di giorno questo avviene), e quanto ci si muove nel letto. Unito al monitoraggio cardio e  dello stress si ha un quadro davvero completo del proprio sonno, molto utile dopo un'attività o durante un periodo di allenamento intensivo.✅ Ogni singola opzione, ad esempio gli avvisi cardio o altre impostazioni  sono attivabili sia dall'app del telefono che direttamente sullo smartwatch. E' possibile inoltre collegare, quindi fare sync e impostare vari settaggi, lo smartwatch al proprio PC, Win e Mac, tramite l'app Garmin Express.✅ Se siete super smanettoni Garmin mette a disposizione il pacchetto SDK per poter sviluppare tramite linguaggio prioritario, praticamente simile al C, app, widget, watchface in ambiente Clipper. C'è una community molto attiva in tal senso e quindi se vorrete cimentarvi alla creazione troverete un valido supporto e valida documentazione.  La possibilità quindi di poter collegare lo smartwatch al PC è fondamentale ed estremamente utile per testare le vostre creazioni, app, watchfaces o widget.✅ L'autonomia è quella dichiarata. Senza attività sportiva e quindi solo con notifiche, monitoraggio cardio H24 in modalità smart e senza SpO2 si fanno 6 giorni e mezzo. Con due attività di 1 ora si arriva a fare 5 giorni. Dipende poi dall'utilizzo, dalla watchface utilizzata (alcune hanno attività in bagkround che consumano di più). Il calcolo più o meno è un 10% circa di consumo con attività e opzione GPS+Galileo (solo GPS consuma un 2/3% in meno), e con un'utilizzo medio / intenso il consumo a giornata, incluso sonno, è circa un 15/20% giorno (smanettamenti, installare e disinstallare app e un discreto numero di notifiche). La ricarica avviene in modo rapido, quindi in circa 45 minuti si passa da un 15% a un 85%. Insomma l'autonomia non sarà un problema.✅ E' da circa 3 settimane che ho questo smartwatch ed ho già ricevuto 3 aggiornamenti software. Viene aggiornato anche il software dei sensori, e del gps. Insomma supporto totale da parte di Garmin.✅ Ho avuto molti smartwatch in passato ed ho una discreta esperienza in merito, quindi posso affermare che questo Garmin Venu SQ è un prodotto veramente completo sotto ogni punto di vista. Per quanto riguarda la corsa possono essere monitorati molti parametri. A primo impatto può sembrare difficile e complicato la sua gestione, ci sono 2 app da mettere sul telefono,  i parametri e le opzioni che sono presenti nello smartwatch sono molti, ma dopo qualche giorno vi renderete conto che il tutto in realtà è molto semplice e super funzionale, molto ben progettato e studiato alla perfezione per poter venire incontro anche all'utente più esigente. Per le funzionalità che ha e per  la fascia di prezzo che viene proposto  a mio avviso questo è il miglior e il più completo prodotto presente sul mercato !L'unica cosa che non mi è piaciuta è la lentezza della sincronizzazione tra smartwatch e telefono, ma è un dettaglio altamente trascurabile.Se siete quindi alla ricerca di un dispositivo per il monitoraggio dell'attività sportiva, da non spendere un capitale, questo è lo smart/sport watch perfetto. Brava Garmin ! 😀😀"", ""OverviewI have long been a loyal user of running watches produced by Garmin and my most recent (and previously much loved) watch is this Garmin Vivo Active 3. I have also road tested the Polar Vantage M, the Polar Ignite recently and now this new Garmin Venu. I typically run 50km to 60km per week (combination of trails and on road) and also use the watches for multi-sports such as weight training, spinning etc. My review below contains the detail but in summary I absolutely love this watch, its functionality and its high quality screen are exactly what was needed in this now quite crowded sports/activity tracking watch area. When combined with the Garmin app you really do have a 5* product which will help with monitoring health and performance.Set Up:- You can set up the watch with or without the Garmin App. It is recommended to use the app and therefore I did (I also love analyising my fitness data so a watch which isn’t syncing with an app is no fun for me).- The watch was easy to set up and both the watch and App were intuitive to use.Charging- The watch arrived with 52% battery power. It comes with a USB charger (note: no mains plug, you will either need to charge via a laptop or a mains to USB charger). The watch attaches to the charger via an each magnetic connection.- The watch went from out of box to being 100% charged in less than 1 hour (via mains).- The charger is a small clip in which attaches to the back of the watch. It attaches easily (it is the same connector as the Vivoactive, a watch with which I have had no charging mishaps in the past and therefore seems to be a robust and reliable system).Aesthetics, general wearability and day to day use- The Garmin Venu looks very good on my wrist, it is a nice size for day to day wear (it is slightly deeper than the Vivoactive 3 but the screen size is about the same size).- It is light and as a result it was easy to forget I was wearing it. It is only 46g (3g heavier than the Vivoactive 3)- The strap is soft and pliable (other running watches such as the the cheaper Polar watches have quite stiff straps).Ease of Operation:- The watch is operated largely by touch screen (there are two buttons on the side of the watch, one which starts/stops activities and can be used a a selector button, the other which is mainly used to access the main menu/settings). I really like the intuitive and easy to use touch screen ability – it feels modern and up to date but more importantly it is very quick to navigate.- To start training you select the top button on the device and then scroll to find the activity you want to start. You can set the watch up so your most frequently used activities are listed up front for a quick start. There are many pre-programmed activities but I have mainly used the running (outdoors), treadmill running, indoor cycling and strength training activities.- The activity is paused by pressing the same button and then the touch screen gives end and save options. I have found that the watch is quicker to start/stop/change activities than the Vivoactive 3 is.GPS log on- There is nothing more frustrating then your watch taking a long time to log onto the GPS signal when you just want to start running, I was concerned about this having read other reviews of this watch.- I had no siginifcant issues with the GPS link up. I have used the watch in a small town, a city, at the start of many races and in the countryside when trail running and the GPS log on was adequate in all locations (usually almost immediate but on rare and more frustrating occasions up to 1 minute).- It is worth noting that the Polar watch I have road tested often found GPS signal before the Garmin watches when I wear them side by side.Activities/Running/Distance Accuracy/GPS- As a runner this is what is most important to me.- The outdoor running accuracy appears to be incredibly good. IMy Vivoactive 3 has matched (with very small tolerances) with official race measured distances in anything from 5km to 30km races. When I tested this Venu vs the Vivoactive 3 (wearing both on the same two runs) they measured almost exactly the same.- On set up I selected automatic pause so when I stop running, for example at traffic lights, the device automatically pauses and then restarts tracking once I am running again. This feature worked well.- I like the strength training rep counter although I don’t always use it (unless I am wanting to deliberately slow down my work rate)Data screens- Along side the accuracy of data the availability of data whilst running is important to me.- Each data screen can hold 4 pieces of data (e.g. pace, distance, time etc.).- You can customise what data you have via the app.- The data was easy to see whilst running and gave me the information I needed to monitor and improve my performance.Display- The display graphics on the Venu and amazing compared to the Vivoactive 3, I am hugely surprised by the improvement. I have photographed the two watches side by side, the Venu on the top is so much better than the Vivoactive 3. It also looks much more modern in terms of what is displayed on the screen, the layout etc.- I really enjoy the fact that you can customise what data you have on your standard watch screen. I have mine set up to show digital time, date and step count. It did take a bit of time to work out how to do this but worth it once you have it working in the way you want it to.Interaction with other devices and apps- In common with all runners I know I like to be able to analyse my running data and look at details such as my heart rate, pace and so on over the course of a run.- The Venu uses the Garmin Connect app to do this (note you can have more than one Garmin device paired up with the app on your phone). The watch is quick to syncronise and does this itself after activities. It can also be forced via the app.- The have my Garmin App (and therefore the watch data) also syncronised to MyFitnessPal so that my calories burnt are sent over to MFP and calories consumed are sent from MFP to the Garmin (watch and app).As a training aide- Being able to pre-program workouts before setting off makes for much easier interval training.- I use the Garmin to write a training plan with specific work-outs (e.g. interval training) and these then become available in the watch on syncing the two together.- The data you get on the watch at the end of the run is not that extensive (the Polar watch may be better for you if you want this on the watch) but the data in the app is extensive and useful for a post race or run postmortem.Battery life- The battery life on the Venu is very good, but outperformed by the Polar by about 10% when both had the same features engaged (e.g. continuous heart rate monitoring). The increased screen quality is however worth the impact on battery life!- As part of my testing I charged it up and took the Venu out for a 3 hour trail jaunt, using GPS the whole time. I came back with just under 50% battery so happy enough with that and it ties into the 6 hours of GPS usage battery claim.Garmin App- The Garmin Connect App is what takes this watch from a very good 4* product to a 5* watch for me.- It is a real life tracker. I track my weight (and my BMI which is automatically tracks), my steps, my menstrual cycle, my calories in (and out, via a link up with MFP), I analyse my run and race results, set and monitor step (and other activity) goals – I must look at the App on average 10 times per day.- The App is easy to use, intuitive and I honestly believe it has contributed to me developing an even healthier lifestyle.- The app is the reason why I can’t see myself moving away from Garmin when I need my next running watch/activity tracker.- As an aside I find the 24/7 heart rate monitoring offered by Garmin devices to be incredibly helpful. I normally can work out I am going down will and illness about 12 hours before hand because of my slightly raised resting heart rate etc.Other features- The ‘sleep’ feature ion the Venu is more accurate than on the Vivoactive 3 which seems to think I’m asleep from the minute I get into bed and start reading until I get up in the morning.- I had the watch paired with my phone all day via the Garmin Connect app so I could receive message etc. notifications – a useful function but it does drain the battery more quickly.In summary the Garmin Venu is an amazing watch supported by a brilliant app and I would not hesitate to recommend it.Update 9th July 2021: After almost 2 years of daily usage, this watch has suddenly encountered a problem where it no longer charges up. I've tried various cables and chargers which work fine on other Garmin watches. After contacting Garmin customer services, they immediately acknowledged the problem and will take back the watch and send a refurbished replacement. This has now been posted back now. So far, first impressions of customer service is very impressive. I will update once matter is resolved.Update 14th July 2021: The refurbished replacement has arrived today, and as far as I can see, it's a in as good as new condition everything seems to work just fine including charging! setting it up was a breeze, just sync up to your phone app and all the settings are transferred across and all ready to go with minimum fuss. Impressive customer service!"", 'Ich bin wohl einer der ersten, die diese Uhr erhalten hat und möchte auf meine Erfahrungen mit ihr eingehen.Seit geraumer Zeit schon suche ich eine Alternative zur Apple Watch für Android User, vorzugsweise mit längerer Akkulaufzeit.Uhren, die ich bisher besessen oder getestet habe:- Android wear von sony (genutzt)- Amazfit verge (genutzt)- Amazfit BIP S (genutzt)- Amazfit GTR 2 (getestet und zurück geschickt)- Garmin Venu (1) (getestet und zurück geschickt- Amazfit GTS 2 Mini (genutzt)- Garmin Vivomove Luxe (genutzt, aktuelle Uhr)Und jetzt sollte nach meiner negativen Erfahrung mit der Venu 1, die Venu 2 (als kleine S) noch einen Versuch bekommen.Die Uhr wurde auf Herz und Nieren geprüft und hier die Pros, Cons und neutralen Punkte:Pro:- Herzfrequenzmessung ist merklich besser als die vorherige Generation von Garmin (Vivomove Luxe, Venu 1), aber nicht auf dem Level einer Apple watch. Dennoch ist die Venu 2 bisher die einzige Uhr, die HIIT einigermaßen verfolgen kann und kein Apple Logo besitzt. Deshalb gibt es hier zähneknirschend ein Lob.- die Größe, auch hier gibt es ein vorsichtiges Lob, weil die Uhr immer noch recht dick ist. Trotzdem, die S Version, verglichen mit den meisten anderen Uhren schön klein.- die Garmin Umgebung. Also App, Einstellungen, sync Möglichkeiten, das ist schon deutlich besser als der Abklatsch von Amazfit. Man merkt auch extrem, dass sich Amazfit hier an Garmin ""orientiert"", aber es eben nicht in gleicher Qualität kopieren kann.- Genauigkeit der restlichen Sensoren, also GPS, Barometer etc. Scheint allesamt besser zu sein als bei der vorherigen Generation. Wobei es jetzt nicht verlgleichbar ist mit dem GPS meines OnePlus 8 Pro, aber Smartphones haben generell ein besseres GPS als Uhren. Es ist auf jeden Fall genau genug und leistet sich wenige Fehler, der Barometer im Gegensatz zur Luxe brauchbar, passt.So die neutralen Punkte:- Display. Ja, Amoled, ja endlich mit dem Glas verklebt und besser als von der Venu 1, aber ganz ehrlich, so nebeneinander ist das Display der 90 Euro ""teuren"" Amazfit GTS 2 nicht schlechter. Wenn ich jetzt entscheiden müsste, welches subjektiv gesehen schöner ist, dann tendiere ich sogar zur billigen Amazfit. Bei einem Preis von 400 Euro ist das maximal ein neutral Punkt, weil ein schlechteres Display als das, wäre negativ.- Bedienung der Uhr. Die ist ok. Wischgesten werden nicht ganz zuverlässig erkannt, dafür ist sie einigermaßen durchdacht. Aber auch hier bewegen wir uns natürlich in einem Preisbereich, in dem die Konkurrenz, natürlich meine ich Apple, ganz andere Maßstäbe setzt. Aber man kommt zurecht, also neutral.- Akkulaufzeit. Ja, die ist jetzt auch ""ok"". Mit Blutsauerstoffmessung über Nacht und ab und zu GPS muss man sie spätestens alle 3 Tage laden. Wie Garmin auf die unrealistischen Werksangaben kommt wissen nur die Götter. Laufzeit also sehr verlgleichbar mit meiner Vivomove Luxe und damit noch ok. Dennoch muss man erwähnen, dass eine GTS 2 Mini problemlos über eine Woche MIT Always on Display kommt, das ist bei Garmin nämlich nicht aktiviert, dazu komme ich bei den Cons.Cons:- Gehäusequalität. Ganz ehrlich, meiner Meinung nach eine Frechheit für das Geld. Die oben erwähnte 90 Euro Amazfit Uhr wirkt hochwertiger, mit chinesischen Herstellern im 150€ Bereich braucht die Uhr sich gar nicht versuchen zu messen. Ja etwas Metall um das Glas aber dann ist es doch ein grenzwertig verarbeiteter plastik Klotz. Hätte ich eine Alternative zur Uhr für Android wäre das auf jeden Fall ein Ausschlusskriterium. Garmin kann es besser, die (auch überteuerte) Vivomove Luxe ist komplett aus Metall, sie wollen nur scheinbar nicht.- Garmins Produktpolitik. Ich mag es einfach nicht, wenn Funktionen, die die Uhr grundsätzlich problemlos ausführen könnte, der teureren Fenix vorbehalten sind. Reine Software Abgrenzungen um ein teureres Produkt zu rechtfertigen (das dann wiederum andere Dinge nicht kann). Find ich nicht gut, gibt ein con. Konkret geht es um Kartennavigation. Könnte die Uhr, kann Garmin, aber sie macht es eben nicht.- Akkulaufzeit bei Always on display. Ja was soll ich sagen, man kann das Display zwar Always on haben, aber die Nutzbarkeit der Uhr ist damit vorbei weil sie schneller leer ist als man bis 3 zählen kann. Andere können das VIEL besser.- Displayränder und Wertigkeitseindruck. Diese beiden Punkte gehen Hand in Hand. Was unterscheidet 2021 Smartphones optisch von 2015? Genau, die Displayränder. Viel Rand ohne Funktion wirkt alt und in einer Uhr, auf der das Display ohnehin generell zu klein ist, ist das wichtiger als im Smartphone. Und dann kommt Garmin 2021 mit einer Uhr die Rand über Rand hat. Damit meine ich erstmal Rand um den Bildschirm, dann nochmal die Metallumrandung, völlig ohne Funktion, dazu. Es wirkt einfach billig, es tut weh zu sehen welche Schmuckstücke man bei Apple fürs gleiche Geld bekommt...- Ladestecker. Ja was soll ich sagen, nichts ist nerviger als eigenartige Ladestecker die nur für die Uhr passen und sonst für nichts. Man muss immer das eine Kabel dabei haben, generell ist das eine Kabel verlegt, es ist nervig. Bei der billiguhr egal, aber eine 400€ Uhr in 2021 muss drahtlos laden können. Da gibt\'s auch keine Diskussion. Kann sie nicht, also con.- Softwarequalität dieser Venu 2. Ich hätte große Probleme. Sie hängt sich auf, Update funktioniert nicht, Apps laden funktioniert nicht, was ich mich alleine am ersten Tag herum geärgert habe. Unglaublich. Ich hatte hier schon ein 1 Stern review stehen, dass ich mittlerweile korrigiert habe. Ja, ich bin einer der ersten der die Uhr gekauft hat aber das war schon unter aller Kanone.Ja was ist also das Fazit?Ich befinde mich in der dummen Situation, dass ich die Uhr wahrscheinlich behalten werde, schlichtweg weil es derzeit keine Alternativen gibt für Android.- Samsung hat noch schlechteren Akku und der herzfrenzsensor ist mies- Polar hat noch mehr plastik und schlechtere Messung- amazfit baut schöne schicke Uhren aber die Qualität der Sportmessungen ist unter aller Kanone bei den top Modellen, software grenzwertig- Huawei ist so ein Mittelding aus Samsung und amazfit, auch da gibt\'s keine Uhr die man wirklich als Alternative zur Apple watch ansehen kann- sämtliche Android wear Uhren disqualifizieren sich durch die Akkulaufzeit und die, die es nicht tun durch Größe und messungenauigkeiten.Ich fühle mich als Android Nutzer als wie der amerikanische Wähler an der Wahlurne 2016, ich habe mich für die Venu 2 entschieden, aber eigentlich wünsche ich mir etwas anderes.', ""I bought this watch as a replacement for a Vivoactive 3. I wanted a newer watch with a nicer display, and better heartrate tracking accuracy. The Vivoactive 3 was never quite amazing at tracking my heartrate through the HIIT nature of powerlifting, and I could be out of breath to the point of needing to bend over to catch my breath after a heavy set of squats and my heartrate would register 99, with the Vivoactive 3 finally registering properly when my heartrate dropped to around 130 bpm.After doing some research on other brands in case I wanted to switch (investigated Fitbit, Amazfit and others), I decided to stick with Garmin for the better battery life, GPS accuracy, body battery feature, and the fact that you can put your own music on the Venu 2/2s whereas Fitbit has removed that feature in favour of streaming only. I use YouTube music, so only supporting Spotify/Deezer on the Fitbits was no deal for me. Amazfit's heart tracking is around as accurate as my Vivoactive 3 if not worse from the reviews I watched analyzing it, so that was also a no-go.In short, the display is lovely, the built-in watch face in the photo fits my preferences perfectly so going to the Connect store for one was not necessary, and the heart rate tracking keeps up with my lifts. Instead of the watch thinking I haven't hit my intensity minutes goals, it realises I do 200-300 per week with my training.The negative reviews here are mostly strikes against the cost of this device for the tracking and accuracy of the metrics vs other cheaper Garmin devices. Remember here that you are paying premium for a nice-looking AMOLED display. If the display type doesn't bother you much, then I would recommend waiting on the Vivoactive 5. If your main activity type is running, then a Forerunner is likely a better option. However, if you're like myself and your main sport is powerlifting or another, and/or you want a beautiful, sharp display on your watch coupled with great battery life, then this is for you."", 'Received the watch earlier than expected - great work, Amazon. The watch looks good, and the display - when it’s on - is pretty. However, that may be the extent of the upside. The problem is the ‘always on’ feature, which is what persuaded me to buy the Venu rather than the Vivoactive 4 (which is identical in function). I have had several Garmin watches, and I also have an Apple Watch 3. Despite its lovely display, the fact that it goes blank and you need to move your wrist to see it made it intolerable for me. The Vivoactive 3 I replaced it with has a less pretty display, but you can always see it - and its sports features are way ahead of anything you can get on the Apple Watch. So the Venu, with an ‘always on’ OLED display, should have combined the best of both, with some functional enhancements too. But the display is very uncooperative. It decides when it’s going to be on, and that often isn’t what you asked it to do! It may show the power-saving ‘always on’ face (basically just the time) for some of the time, but refuse to wake up and show the full display when you move it. Or it will just be blank. And resolutely stay blank until you hit it. Hard. No amount of playing with the screen settings has resolved this behaviour. I hope a firmware update will improve it (mine is on 3.4), but as yet I can’t recommend it.', 'Als die Venu angekündigt wurde wusste ich dass ich nicht wiederstehen konnte und von meiner Forerunner 645 Music umsteigen werde. Dank Vorbestellung von Amazon hatte ich sie schon vor Release und konnte sie schon gut testen.+Design: die Uhr wirkt sehr hochwertig, dezent und edel und kann sogar mit Silikonband zu schicken Outfits getragen werden. Die Verarbeitung lässt wirklich nicht zu wünschen übrig und sie lässt sich bequem den ganzen Tag tragen+Display: für mich die perfekte Größe und hier der erste deutliche Unterschied zur Forerunner: sehr schöne Farben, gestochen scharf und auch im Training immer gut ablesbar.Ich hatte etwas Bedenken wegen dem Touchscreen aber wurde überzeugt. Es lässt sich präzise navigieren, reagiert promt. Da Garmin ja ein sehr umfangreiches Menü hat, fällt es mir mit dem Touchscreen sogar deutlich leichter.+Training: für mich das wichtigste denn ich suchte keine SmartWatch mit Fitnessfunktion sondern eine LAUFuhr! Denn ich laufe 5mal Pro Woche im ambitionierten Marathontraining. Hier bietet bie Venu gleiches Potential wie die Forerunner mit einigen Verbesserungen.1. Das GPS findet deutlich schneller Signal2. Der Herzfrequenz Sensor ist sehr genau und reagiert schnell auf Änderung was für mich im Intervall Training sehr wichtig istDie Forerunner konnte ich hier nur mit Brustgurt verwenden, bei der Venu ist die Messung am Handgelenk so exakt dass ich den Gurt immer weniger benutze.+Akku: die Uhr kam mit gut 90% Akku an, ich habe sie nicht geladen und jetzt 4 Tage benutzt. Dabei war ich drei Mal trainieren und habe natürlich am Anfang viel an der Uhr gespielt. Aktuell haben ich noch 26% , die Akkuleistung scheint also sogar besser als von Garmin angegeben. Ganz klar ein Plus!Ich kann bisher nichts kritisieren. Der pulsoximeter ist nett, für mich aber eher eine kleine Spielerei. Die Funktion mit der Body Battery ist aber toll! Ich bin sehr zufrieden', ""I do a lot of running and wanted to be able to ditch my phone but still track my runs and listen to music. I did a lot of research before buying this watch and decided this was the best option. I got it for under £200.MUSIC: The built in Spotify app is a feature which the Apple Watch doesn't have. This is really useful and simple to sync music / podcasts (albeit note that Garmin / Spotify have a problem with syncing podcasts from BBC Sounds - I have taken this up with both of them and got a very disappointing response that they are not supported).ACTIVITIES: The Venu Sq tracks all activities. I use it to run and in the gym. It tracks my runs accurately and (once setup) links automatically to my strava. It tracks sets / reps relatively well in the gym automatically. You can amend the exercise / reps / weight in the Garmin Connect app after (although this does keep crashing when I amend the above which is annoying).PERFORMANCE: The touch screen is ok. I have always found Garmin a bit difficult to navigate. My father has a Forerunner and I struggle to use the buttons on that. But it's certainly no worse than any other Garmin.BUILD: I have scratched the side of the watch which is annoying. I have since bought a screen protector and that has helped avoid any scratches to the screen. But overall the build seems good. Put it to use; it doesn't matter if it gets a little scratched.OVERALL: Overall I'm really happy with the watch. It's great for what I wanted, i.e. to ditch my phone. I still think it's great to go out running with just my headphones and a key. The Apple Watch doesn't give you the links to Spotify. There are limited number of Garmin watches that do. This is the cheapest; but I think it does just as good a job at tracking activities as a Forerunner (not tried a Fenix)."", 'I bought this to replace my broken Fitbit charge 3. The data captured is much more useful for me to understand my body situation than my Fitbit. Charging it every day I take a shower, and it comes to 100% battery after that. Synchronization is fast and smooth (while my old charge 3 took a lot of time and sometimes not syncing for the whole day), the screen is clear to see, and the interface can be customised to very personal, friendly one.', ""I love a good watch.I think it's fair to say I've owned a large number of watches during my life, both standard and smart. Most smartwatches come with an array of functions, most of which are useless to me. I started getting smartwatches because I kept missing calls/texts and wanted something to help with that. The vibration motor on this watch is perfect for this; it's certainly not something you'll miss when you get called etc.Last year my wife suggested that I may be suffering from sleep apnea, so I decided to see what watches were around that could help prove that. It turns out that although there are a lot of watches out there with SPO2 functionality, the majority of them don't run a continuous trace, and instead just have an on-demand check. For someone looking to monitor sleep, this is useless. So I was down to just a few watches, and the price point meant that realistically it was down to this watch and the Fitbit Versa 3.I spent weeks researching the two watches, and was almost decided on the Versa; with a slightly larger screen and AMOLED at that, it seemed a no-brainer. Until I saw some posts on the Fitbit forums where everyone was complaining that to analyse SPO2 results required a monthly fee. All the posts contained people's wish they'd gone for this watch instead. My mind was made up.So here we are.There is a lot of functionality in this watch, most of which I've not used. It seems accurate enough in my step count and can tell me how far I've walked on the off-chance I've walked anywhere.The sleep monitoring is on a par with other watches but can give me not only the information about what type of sleep I've had at various points during the night, but also how many breaths per minute I'm managing, and of course the all-important SPO2 graph.The stress monitoring I'm not totally sure about; it shows I get very little stress during the night, but it can get quite high during the working day. I do have a stressful job, but it's not something I've really thought as affecting me in any negative way. Something to keep an eye on I guess.The app (android) gives you all the information you need about all functions offered and is very easy to understand (with information pages where needed).The screen is easy to read inside and outside - I've yet to try it outside on a sunny day, but we don't get many of those and aren't allowed outside anyway. It's small though, which is a small issue for me as I wear glasses for up-close work like reading and using computers, but don't wear them otherwise; making the watch hard to see. You can change the watch face, however, and with a large selection to choose from (and the option to make your own), there's certainly something for every eye strength.It'll be hard for me to pass judgement on the battery life; for my use, it lasts 6-8 days which is great, but I do very little exercise at the moment and appreciate that the battery life will be far less if I'm running all over the shop every day.Overall, I'm really happy with this watch; the only thing I'd change would be to have a larger screen.I might keep this one the longest."", 'Ich habe von einer Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music auf die Venu gewechselt.Für mich war das Mip Display der Vivoactive 3 Music optisch ein Graus, hat aber seine Arbeit bei allen Lichtverhältnissen anstandslos getan.Da ich meine Uhr 24h trage und auch gerne zu feierlichen Anlässen, kommt mir die Venu mit dem Amoled Display gerade recht.Das Menü der Venu ist etwas anders aufgebaut als bei der Vivoactive, aber dafür auch mit zwei Knöpfen zu bedienen.Ich denke ein Knopf hätte es hier auch getan.Habe die Uhr erst seit sechs Tagen in Gebrauch, musste sie aber auch erst zweimal laden.Dazu zählen 16h always on Display, ständiger Pulsmesser, gelegentliche Benachrichtigungen, 2,5h Indooraktivität ohne GPS sowie eine Outdooraktivität mit GPS.Das Armband der Vivoactive konnte ich wieder verwenden (20mm Stegbreite) und auch so macht die Uhr einen optisch schönen Eindruck.Sie liegt gut am Handgelenk und ist für ihr Format sehr leicht.Das Ladekabel ist mit der Vivoactive identisch.Im IQ Store findet man zur Zeit leider noch nicht so viele Watchfaces.Aber ich denke das legt sich bald.Als Umsteiger bin ich letztendlich vollkommen zufrieden, auch wenn ich bei der Ablesbarkeit in der prallen Sonne im Gegensatz zur Vivoactive Abstriche machen muss.', 'Possédant actuellement une Venu 2S et une Venu SQ je vous livre mon comparatif de ces 2 montres étonnantes.Points communs : les deux modèles tournent sous l\'OS propriétaire Garmin qui est intéressant car peu gourmand en ressources, ce qui garantit une autonomie de 5 à 8 jours en utilisation normale pour les 2 modèles. En revanche, l\'activation en continu de la fonction de lecture des musiques réduit l\'autonomie à un jour.Les deux modèles ont la même interface mais la présence de l\'écran AMOLED et une meilleure réactivité rendent l\'usage du modèle 2S bien plus agréable à l\'usage. Tous les capteurs classiques sont disponibles : GPS (+ GLONAS+ GALILEO), boussole, Oxymètre de pouls, Fréquence cardiaque, compteur de pas, etc. La 2S propose en plus un baromètre qu\'il faudra étalonner mais qui permettra de calculer notamment le nombre d\'étages parcourus en cours de journée.Principales différences :La Venu SQ est une montre à cadran rectangulaire et écran LCD. Elle existe en version basique ou en version ""musique"", cette dernière permettant de jouer des morceaux enregistrés ou en streaming vers un appareil Bluetooth sans passer par un smartphone. Aucune des deux montres ne dispose d\'un haut-parleur ou d\'un micro. Par contre elles sont équipées d\'un vibreur très efficace pour vous alerter.La finition est correcte mais les boutons en plastique et le bracelet font un peu ""cheap"". Mais, à moins de 200€, le tarif reste imbattable par rapport aux fonctionnalités proposées.La Venu 2S est une version plus évoluée qui inclut un écran rond AMOLED 1,2 pouce haute résolution, un cerclage en acier inoxydable, et des animations des exercices sur l\'écran. Ce modèle est non seulement plus qualitatif mais il est aussi plus réactif, donc je suppose que le processeur embarqué dans la 2S est plus puissant.Esthétiquement je trouve le modèle 2S beaucoup plus réussi et, malgré une taille identique de 40mm, il apparait plus discret et plus élégant sur un petit poignet.Capteurs de santé communes aux 2 montres :Une Venu/Venu2 se porte toute la journée et toute la nuit, de sorte que la montre affiche les scores de vos constantes physiques. Ceci ne pose aucun problème vu la légèreté et l\'autonomie des 2 appareils qui dépasse 5 jours sans problème. De plus ces deux modèles sont également étanches.Fréquence cardiaque : mesurée au poignet elle est très précise sur les 2 montres. Elle peut s\'afficher à la demande ou même apparaître en permanence sur l\'écran d\'accueil (le ""cadran de montre""). C\'est le même capteur pour les 2 appareils.Oxymètre de pouls : mesure le taux d\'oxygène sanguin. Cette mesure est sensible au mouvement ou à la position de la montre sur le poignet. Contrairement à d\'autres montres, on peut ici demander le calcul de la SpO2 à tout moment (ça prend une dizaine de secondes) sachant que l\'appareil peut l\'enregistrer à intervalle régulier pendant que vous dormez, ce qui peut être très utile si vous soupçonnez une apnée du sommeil.La Venu 2S bénéficie d\'un capteur plus récent que la SQ et j\'ai effectivement constaté des mesures plus précises pour la 2S par rapport à un capteur à l\'index que je possède par ailleurs et qui a été correctement étalonné.Respiration : il s’agit du nombre de respiration par minute. La donnée est mesurée en temps réel en permanence et participe au score de votre sommeil.Fonction de synthèse :L’aperçu santé donne un aperçu de votre état de santé général à un moment donné. Le score est basé sur plusieurs paramètres : fréquence Cardiaque (FC), variabilité de la FC, taux d\'oxygène sanguin, respiration et stress.Le moniteur d\'énergie donne votre « réserve » d\'énergie tout au long de la journée (échelle de 1 à 100). Un nombre plus élevé signifie que vous êtes prêt pour une activité ; un nombre plus faible signifie que votre réserve d\'énergie est déchargée et que vous avez besoin d\'une pause.Suivi du stress : c\'est un indicateur composite calculé à partir des efforts réalisés et des temps de repos. Tout est pris en compte y compris le nombre de pas ou le nombre d\'étages parcourus.Suivi de l\'hydratation et des calories : ces deux indicateurs demandent votre participation puisque la montre ne peut pas savoir ce que vous absorbez en liquide ou en calories. Par contre elle connait vos dépenses à partir des efforts réalisés et de vos paramètres physiques (âge, taille, poids). Ceci permet au final de savoir si vous êtes en excédent ou en déficit de calories ou d\'hydratation.Suivi du cycle menstruel : non testéSuivi de la respiration : mesurée en permanence et en temps réel. Je n\'ai aucune idée sur la méthode employée par ces appareils pour mesurer la respiration, mais les chiffres annoncés me semblent réalistes et viennent compléter les statistiques de suivi.Suivi du sommeil : les 2 montres sont capables de détecter quand vous vous couchez et quand vous dormez. Vous définissez un objectif pour l\'heure de coucher et l\'heure de réveil, et un score est calculé sur la base de la durée et de la qualité de votre sommeil, sachant que les 3 phases (léger, profond et paradoxal) sont détectées et suivies. L\'historique de votre taux d\'oxygène pendant le sommeil est également géré.Fonctions généralesActivité : Les montres Venu sont des montres de Fitness orientées vers le sport et la santé. De nombreuses activités sont gérées pour tous les types de sports, y compris la natation ou le ski. Une activité peut être déclenchée manuellement mais aussi automatiquement car la montre détecte vos mouvements et vos déplacements. Ainsi, si vous démarrez une balade, la montre le détecte et déclenchera le suivi de l’activité après un temps que vous définissez mais à partir du moment exact de votre départ. Elle détectera aussi toute interruption pendant votre marche et la décomptera de votre activité. Pour les activités en salle, la montre peut se connecter à différents capteurs extérieurs pour améliorer le suivi.Notifications du téléphone : vous pouvez décider via l\'application Garmin quelles notifications seront transmises à votre montre. La communication s\'effectue en Bluetooth et non en Wi-Fi ce qui signifie que la montre doit rester à proximité du téléphone.Suivi et réponses aux messages (SMS, WhatsApp...) : comme pour les notifications, votre montre et votre smartphone peuvent partager les messages et les réponses pour la plupart des applications de messagerie. La montre ne disposant pas d\'un clavier, on enregistre des réponses courtes (Oui, Non, Je te rappelle plus tard, etc.) que l\'on sélectionne avec une liste déroulante et que l\'on peut envoyer au correspondant sans passer par le téléphone.Livetrack : cette fonction permet d\'informer des proches sur sa position pendant une activité. La fonction peut se déclencher manuellement ou automatiquement lorsque la montre détecte le démarrage d\'une activité (course, marche, vélo, rando...).Alerte temps réel vers un proche : il est possible de définir jusqu’à trois contacts pouvant être alertés (par SMS et email) en cas d\'urgence en appuyant pendant 5 secondes sur le bouton supérieur de la montre.Musique : La Garmin SQ simple ne possède pas de lecteur intégré et peut juste piloter le lecteur de musique de votre smartphone via Bluetooth.En optant pour les modèles SQ ou 2S avec fonction musique, vous disposez de 8Go de mémoire pour stocker vos MP3 dans la montre, soit par transfert de fichiers via USB (mp3 à copier dans le dossier MUSIC de la montre) soit en utilisant l\'application Garmin. Il est sans doute possible de transférer des fichiers depuis le smartphone vers la montre en utilisant un câble OTG mais je ne peux le garantir.Les Venu 2S/SQ avec fonction musiques sont également capables d\'accéder à Internet via Wi-Fi et donc d\'utiliser les services de streaming, comme Deezer, Spotify ou Amazon Music. Il manque à l\'appel YouTube Music.Garmin Pay est disponible sur les 2 modèles et fonctionne parfaitement, si votre banque supporte le service. Un paiement s\'effectuera directement sans contact avec la montre à présenter sur le terminal de paiement, après introduction de votre code secret configurable au moment de l\'association du service avec votre carte de paiement.L’application Garmin doit obligatoirement être installée sur votre smartphone pour faire l’appairage et l’initialisation. Elle permet de faire le lien entre la montre et votre smartphone, soit pour le paramétrer, soit pour afficher des statistiques. L\'application est très bien conçue et je n\'ai eu absolument aucun problème pour l\'utiliser, y compris en synchro avec les 2 appareils en même temps.Cloud :Le site connect.garmin.com permet de gérer tous les appareils Garmin enregistrés et d\'accéder aux tableaux de bord détaillés de votre activité.La boutique ConnectIQ vous permet de télécharger des centaines d\'activités, widgets ou cadrans de montres, sachant que pour ces derniers, la plupart sont modifiables directement depuis la montre.L\'écosystème n\'est évidemment pas aussi étendu que Wear OS mais on trouve ce qu\'on veut, y compris des boussoles, des logiciels de navigation, etc. Et la plupart de ces applications sont gratuites.Conclusion :Un critère important pour une montre connectée est l\'autonomie, et de ce point de vue, les deux modèles sont très bons, avec entre 10 et 15% de batterie consommée par jour avec une activité d\'une heure utilisant le GPS. Vous pouvez vous contenter de recharger ces montres une fois par semaine.Autre critère important, la précision du GPS. Et là encore c\'est très bon avec quasiment aucune déviation avec un GPS de smartphone.Au final, à moins de 200€ la Venu SQ est une super affaire pour celui qui veut s\'initier à l\'usage d\'une montre de fitness connectée. Avec la 2S on est clairement sur un modèle beaucoup plus élégant et qualitatif, qui conviendra mieux aux petits poignets. Pour ma part j’opte pour la 2S couleur gris clair et cerclage acier que vous voyez sur les photos.', ""Ok hardware, but software makes very poor use of the new high-resolution AMOLED display.The Venu seems rushed to market to me. It has a nice, bright high resolution display. However, other than a handful of pretty (but mostly featureless) watch faces, the Garmin software makes absolutely no use of the display. Most of the UI and many of the watch faces look pixelated and rough. Whilst Garmin get away with this on the MIP display used on their other always-on smartwatches - the higher resolution display of the Venu just exposes how bad the UI is. If you are expecting the Venu to be a polished version of the Vivoactive you will be very disappointed. This is no Apple/Samsung watch competitor.Added to this, in my copy of the watch, the touch screen display was often unresponsive. It was so bad at recognising left/right swipes that I found it almost impossible to change watch faces.As-is I can't recommend the Venu - the software just isn't fit for purpose. Which is a shame."", '(Unten sind 2 Update)Aktuell trage ich, zum Vergleichen, mal eine 120€ Huawei Watch GT active und die neue Garmin Venu.Ich habe mich wie Sau auf die Garmin gefreut, bin aber auf dem Boden der Tatsachen angelangt. Aber von vorne.Vor Jahren trug ich eine Forerunner 235 und war sehr zufrieden. Dann machte ich den Fehler eine Vivoactive 3 zu kaufen. Nachdem ich diese zurückgegeben habe bin ich über Samsung und Amazfit bei der Huawei Watch GT gelandet (auch bei Amaz. gekauft). Nach der Ankündigung der Venu konnte ich es kaum erwarten endlich wieder ein gutes Device zu haben. Zudem, und das sollte man nicht unerwähnt lassen, ist das Garmin Webfrontend wirklich gut.350€ will Garmin für diese überaus leichte Uhr. Die Leichtigkeit hat mich positiv überrascht.Bis heute kann die Garmin-App unter Android scheinbar keine Widgets. Ansonsten ist sie sehr aufschlussreich und detailliert. Als Beispiel im Anhang ein Screenshot des Dashboards. Um kurz vor 10 der letzte Sync um 05:50, autoamtisch wird bei mir nichts gesynct. So machen dann natürlich Widgets auch keinen Sinn.Ich hab dann gleich mal nen Track ausprobiert. Einen Ausschnitt sieht man im angehängten Bild. Die Huawei trackt diesen Gang genau so blöd. Also quer über die Straße und dergleichen. Ich bin natürlich straight gegangen. Herzfrequenz und Co stimmen halbwegs überein. Zumindest gibt es kein Device welches sich jetzt irgendwie besonders auffällig anders verhält. Wo hier 350€ zu verantworten sind? Mir ist das nicht ganz klar.SchlaftrackerHier sind die Daten durchaus unterschiedlich. Aber das liegt an den unterschiedlichen Logiken mit denen die Firmen auswerten. Fair Deal und nachvollziehbarABER: Garmin schafft es auch mit dem neuen Device nicht Nickerchen zu erfassen. Die Huawei macht das mit traumtänzerischer Sicherheit. Zudem MUSS ich, wenn ich das alles richtig sehe, noch immer ""Nicht stören"" Zeiten einrichten an die sich die Garmin hält. Bei der Huawei wird dies aufgrund der guten Schlaferkennung überflüssig.Der Blutsauerstoffsensor hält sich exakt an die eingestellte Zeit die man angeben muss um zu definieren wann man ungefähr schläft (wenn man den Sensor nicht ganztägig aktiv lässt, ist aber überflüssig). Das wiederum bedeutet das ich in der Woche um 5 aufstehe - am Wochenende aber bis 9 schlafe. Somit trackt der Oximeter Sensor NUR von 21:30 bis 5 Uhr.Klar, ich könnte das erweitern. Ich frage mich aber wo Garmin die Entwicklung verpasst hat wenn Huawei das mit seiner 120€ Watch GT Active (nicht Watch GT 2) problemlos kann.Das Display.Ist absolut einwadfrei. Als negativ Beispiel sei hier die Amazfit Verge genannt. Die hat selbst im hellsten Modus kaum die Sonne ausgehalten.Allerdings ist das Display der Venu durch den Klarlackplastikring (wie bei der Vivoative 3 Music) künstlich klein gehalten. Es geht aber noch und ist soweit OK. Gefühlt ist kaum eines der Watchfaces die man im Hauseigenen Store (kostenlos) anbietet wirklich angepasst.Das Design:Ist schon OK. Wenn ich die Watch GT sehe wirklich diese einfach etwas maskuliner, erwachsener und ""stärker"".Was mir so gar nicht gefällt ist der Umgang seitens Garmin mit den Kunden. Man betreibt ein eigenes Forum, liest aber (nach Supportaussagen) dort gar nicht mit. Kümmert sich gar nicht drum. Die Venu scheint ein ziemlich problematischer Launch zu sein. Firmware 3.50 ist derzeit 3 Wochen alt und im Venu/Vivoactive 4 Forum häufen sich Probleme. Die VA4 und die Venu sind, bis auf das Display, identisch.Bitte nicht falsch verstehen. Die Huawei hat genügend Schwächen. Aber die kostet auch kein kleines Vermögen.Aktuell sehe ich keinerlei Grund bei der Venu zu bleiben. Das großartige Webfrontend wäre tatsächlich der einzige Grund dazu. Ich werde noch eine FW abwarten und sehen welche Änderungen Garmin denn nach X Wochen doch dem Kunden noch an die Hand gibt. Ansonsten geht die Venu weinenden Auges zurück. Applepreise mit dieser Qualität bin ich nicht bereit zu zahlen. Alleine das der GPS Sensor so ungenau wie der von Huawei ist enttäuscht mich massiv.Ich frage mich da schon ob veraltetet strukturen und ""festhalten an bekannten Dingen"" dazu führt das es scheinbar im Softwarebereich so wenig Fortschritte gibt. Schlaftracker? Naps? Widgets? Auto-Sync der Daten von der Uhr zum Handy? Alles Teufelszeug oder so gewünscht? wenn ""Gewünscht"", vom wem? Zu alten Entwicklern oder Firmenentscheidern?------------------------------------------------------------------------>>--->> Update vom 15.11.2019Die Venu geht zurück. Sehr sehr schweren Herzens muss ich mir eingestehen das es so keinen Sinn macht. Ich werde Garmin und die Uhr vermissen.Stresslevel/Body Battery.:Garmin ist scheinbar nicht in der Lage Nickerchen zu erkennen. Das macht die ""Body Battery"" zum Witz. Ich würde erwarten das sich meine Batterie aufüllt wenn ich mich mal ausruhe. Nix da. Geht weiter runter. Parallel füllt sie sich auf wenn ich im Stau stehe und mich ärgere.Schlaftracker:Kaputt wie eh und je. Ich hab, nach der VA3 2018, ein paar Dinge ausprobiert. Samsung, Amazfit, Huawei usw und sogar diese seltsame Nokia Matratze. Sobald ich ein Garmindevice um tue sind meine Shclafwerte komplett im Eimer. Tiefschlaf? Mit viel Glück mal 30 Minuten, eher weniger. Der starre SPOx Sensor, der (scheinbar) nicht OnDemand gestartet werden kann misst in der Regel ~5% weniger als ein 20€ Fingersensor.GPS Tracker:Im letzten Bild (ich weiß das die Auf Amazon zu klein und unscharf sind) ist als Beispiel ein Walk zu sehen. Einmal die Strasse hoch und wieder runter. Natürlich MIT Jacke, wir haben Herbst.Genau das macht meine 120€ Watch GT ebenso mies, oder gut.....der kann ich das verzeihen. Einer 370€ Garmin Venu eher nichtFür mich ist hier Ende. Ich sehe mich nicht in der Lage das weiter zu unterstützen. Die 3.60 FW, die gestern kam, verbessert dahingehen auch nichts. Wenn Garmin den Betastest an den Käufern zu Applepreise durchziehen will? Bitteschön. Sollte die Venu mal unter 250€ fallen bin ich wieder dabei. Ich muss halt leider selber kaufen.------------------Update 18.11.2019Sucht man sich in einem Videoportal das Vergleichsvideo von Pocketnavigation zur Fenix 6 so sieht man sehr schnell wie ungenau der GPS Chip ist. Das ist quasi das gleich wie bei dem einfachen Track von mir festgestellt. Da ist so viel daneben.', ""I've previously owned the Vivoactive 3. When the Vivoactive 4 came along I had no doubt whatsoever that I was going to get it.Then I discovered the Venu which was marketed as a Vivoactive 4 with a better screen.The one (tiny) gripe I always had with my V3 was that the screen colours were not very good and quite flat (even though it's very good in bright light).The Venu changed all that. Very deep colours on a 390 x 390 AMOLED display (vs the 240 x 240 on the V3).The watch has a great number of features and options, but most of them will be familiar to Garmin users. The Body Battery is a neat feature, as is the Pulse Ox, even though I haven't had the chance to test this thoroughly yet.I find the device quite responsive and the battery life (so far) seems very decent.The Venu is very light but looks and feels like a premium product.One difference with the V3 (in the V3's favour) is that the Venu is doesn't have an 'always on' feature, i.e. you have to double tap the screen or press the top button to view. Not an issue though and I can see why they've done that as it would be a huge drain on the battery.All in all I'm very happy with my purchase. There have already been several software updates and I'm sure there will be more going forward to dial in this new product.If functionality comes first and display quality is less of a consideration, go for the Vivoactive 4. If you want the functionality and also enjoy a great display, go for the Venu."", 'Okay, da ist sie. Man was war ich scharf auf das Teil. Aber leider ist nun, weitgehend, Ernüchterung eingekehrt.Zunächst zu mir: meine erste SmartWatch war eine Garmin, danach kamen diverse andere Modelle,ua. von Fitbit, Mobvoi Ticwatch und Huawei.Schon damals war die Garmin irgendwie umständlich, bzw. unlogisch zu bedienen. Irgendwie finde ich keine klare Linie auf dem Weg durch die Menüs. Das hat sich leider in meinem Augen noch verschlimmbessert.Die dazugehörige App(s) sind etwas besser, aber meiner Meinung nach immer noch schlechter als die anderen Hersteller.Es dauert sowohl auf der Uhr, als auch in den Apps etwas länger, sich zurecht zu finden.Zur Hardware: ich wusste, dass ich hier kein Schmuckstück bekomme, dafür steht Garmin einfach nicht. Ist halt ein Plastikbomber, aber der ist gut verarbeitet, kann man tragen.Die Datenerfassung scheint recht gut zu sein, aber das muss ich noch ein paar Tage beobachten, bis ich mir hier eine endgültige Meinung bilden kann.Ich werde diese Rezension weiter aktuell halten und berichten, ob das Dingen hier bleibt, oder zurück gehen muss.Wie gesagt, aufgrund der unnötig umständlichen Software bin ich immo noch sehr enttäuscht.Update 2.9.:Ich mag sie .., irgendwie. Bildschirm ist toll, sie ist gut zu tragen!Aber das Teil nervt.Zum Beispiel Schlaferfassung: geht quasi nur zu den vorher eingestellten Zeiten, von selbst merkt dass Teil nichts. Morgens muss man der Uhr sogar sagen, das man wach ist. Kann zB. Huawei deutlich besser.Beispiel Training: Habe mir über die App zwei Krafttrainings ausgesucht und auf die Uhr übertragen lassen. Glaubt mal nicht, dass die dort irgendwo zu finden sind.Überhaupt: die Bedienung ist dermaßen unlogisch, warum macht man das nicht so aufgeräumt und logisch wie die Mitbewerber?Okay, ich überlege noch 2 Tage, tendiere aber stark dazu, sie zurück zu geben! Schade Garmin...Update 12.10.Tja, da ich immer noch hin und her gerissen war, habe ich Depp den Rückgabezeitpunkt verpasst. Selbst schuld.Eigentlich hat sich für mich nichts verändert, ist ne Art Hassliebe geblieben. Garmin hat leider noch keine, für mich entscheidende, Updates gebracht. Werden sie wohl auch nicht mehr, ist scheinbar Firmenpolitik, die Benutzer mit Software, sowohl in der App als auch auf der Uhr, ohne Sinn und Verstand zu ärgern.Warum z.B. ist der untere Bedienbutton nicht mit einer Funktion belegbar? Oder bin ich zu blöd, das zu finden...???Außer der Schlafüberwachung (wieso lebe ich eigentlich noch?) überzeugen mich jedenfalls die Messwerte. Der GPS-Fix dauert in der Regel leider sehr lang. Die angegebene Akkulaufzeit stimmt ungefähr.Garmin, da wäre so viel mehr drin gewesen!', 'Pros:- Sieht ganz gut aus- Heart-Rate tracking sehr akkurat- Gutes GPS trackingCons *Tief Luft hohl*:- Physische KnöpfeDiese sind rechts was beim tragen von Wrist Wraps/Straps beim Bodybuilding/Krafttraining zu versehentlichen auslösen führt. Das ist super nervig- Sleep TrackingEinschlaf, Aufsteht und Wachzeiten sind zwar ziemlich gut, das war es aber auch schon.Vorallem die Tief, Leicht und REM Schlafphasen sind jenseits von gut und Böße. Pro nacht habe ich nur eine Tiefschlafphase welche nahezu direkt nach dem einschlafen liegt und zwischen 10 und 30 minuten liegt, das wars.Bei review videos auf youtube habe ich nahezu identische aufnahmen gesehen.Das wirkt fast so als würde Garmin zufällige werte wählen und diese nach einem gewissen schema anzeigenHierbei handelt es sich jedoch nur um Vermutungen. Ob die Daten vll. doch korrekt sind kann ich leider nicht 100% sagen.Koffein konsumieren ich ggf. 8 std. vorm schlafen gehen das letzte mal (12 mittag) und oftmals (Wochenende) sogar ca. 12 std. zuvor. Darn kann es also nicht liegen.Auch trotz Schlaftabletten (das erste mal das ich welche genommen habe, heißt ich konnte noch keine Toleranz bilden) haben sie die werte nicht verändert.- Automatisches starten von Gehen/LaufenDa ich kein Läufer bin habe ich nur gehen ""verwendet"". Als Hundebesitzer bin ich hier öfter draußen und das automatische starten funktioniert einfach gar nicht.Initial habe ich etwa 20-30km (über mehrere Tage) manuell getracked und dann das automatische tracking angeschalten.Dieses startet entweder gar nicht oder nachdem ich bereits wieder zurück bin und gerade durch die Haustürewieder rein gehe.- VibrationSelbst auf niedrig ist es noch fast zu viel wobei das größere problem die dauer der vibration ist.Je nach gewähltem training löst der untere Knopf eine bestimmte Aktion aus (Gehen/Laufen = Neue Runde, Krafttraining = Neues Set).Hier vibriert die Uhr dann für gefühlt 2 Sekunden. Das mag nach einer Kleinlichkeit klingen aber treibt mich in den Wahnsinn.- Rep-Counting bei ""Kraftsport""Liegt einfach immer gewaltig daneben und das obwohl ich meine Übungen sehr bewusst und kontrolliert durchführe.Da mich aber hauptsächlich Herzfrequenz interessiert (da ich Übung/Sets/Reps anderweitig pflege) würde ich dieses feature einfach ausschalten......wenn das denn möglich wäre- App (Android)Auch wenn diese so ziemlich alles anzeigt was man benötigt ist diese ein absolutes Chaos und benötigt ein dringendes Redesign am besten auf Basis der Material Guidelines.Das ist aber das kleinste Mako und vertretbar wenn man sich ein-/zweimal intensiver mit der app beschäftigt.- ArmbandHier handelt es sich um ein ziemliches Standard Armband und das nervt. An und Ablegen der Uhr dauert mir einfach viel zu lange und die Schlaufe, wo man das ende des Armbands einfädelt, ist sehr schwer verschiebbar.Hat man die Uhr nun schon 50% angelegt und merkt das diese Schlaufe falsch positioniert ist, heißt es entweder wie ein blöder ""reisen"" um es zu verschieben oder die Uhr nochmal abnehmen.Wieder eine Kleinigkeit aber trotzdem nervig.Wenigstens eine Sache die man mit 3rd-Party Armbändern lösen könnte- ChargingKudos an Garmin dafür das sie scheinbar immer den gleichen Ladestecker verwenden und nicht wie bsp. Fitbit mit jeder version einen neuen raus bringen.Nichts desto trotz würde ich mir hier wireless charging wünschen auch wenn die Uhr sehr schnell über Kabel lädt.Auch wieder eine Kleinigkeit über die man hinweg sehen kann.Fazit:Da für mich Sleep-Tracking genau so wichtig ist wie das tracking von Training oder sogar noch mehr da Recovery extrem wichtig ist und ich wissen muss wen mein Schlaf WIRKLICH schlecht war um den vortag zu reflektieren und ggf. Anpassungen zu machen, muss ich mich von Garmin leider verabschieden.Sleep-Tracking ist wohl noch nie eine Stärke von Garmin gewesen und auch wenn Sie einen Blog-Post haben der darüber Spricht das es ziemlich Akkurat sein soll kann ich das einfach nicht glauben.', ""I've had my watch for a few months now and I would now feel naked without it. I didn't wear a watch before so it took some getting used to. Firstly having something on your wrist and then the fact that you can shower with it on as well. It's so easy to use and lightweight.  I only charge the battery once a week which is great and it charges really quickly so I only have to be without it for less than an hour. It's really helped with tracking my activity levels, my calories, my steps but one of the features I love the most is the body battery.  It is so useful to know when I need to slow down, get more sleep and maybe skip the gin and tonic in order to get to 100% the next day. I don't think I could be without this watch now. It's the first smart watch I've had and I love it! No buyers remorse at all!!"", ""<><><><><>𝙍𝙚𝙘𝙚𝙣𝙨𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙗𝙧𝙚𝙫𝙚<><><><><>Questo smart/sport-watch⌚️ della Garmin è un'ottima alternativa ai vari Amazfit e company se si vuole un orologio di media gamma che offre tutto allo sportivo amatoriale e perché no anche agli sportivi più seri.Design molto gradevole, di solito me lo scambiano per un (ben più costoso) Apple Watch, le funzioni che offre sono davvero tante: quasi ogni sport, pulseOx, analisi del livello di stress con conseguente suggermineto di esercizi di respirazione e tanto altro tutto visibile sulla pagina di presentazione del prodotto.Parlandovi dell'utilizzo giornaliero: ti scordi di averlo al polso, leggerissimo, unica nota dolente (se proprio vogliamo) è la batteria che siu consuma più velocemente di quanto promesso.Sinceramente a me non cambia molto perché avendo momenti morti durante la giornata mi è possibile caricarlo.Se volete saperne di più la recensione continua sotto! Buona giornata e spero abbiate Utile il mio parere!<><><><><>𝙍𝙚𝙘𝙚𝙣𝙨𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙚𝙩𝙖<><><><><>ESPERIENZA PERSONALE: Dopo averci pensato davvero tanto ho iniziato a mettere da parte dei soldi ogni qualvolta andavo a correre per sostituire il mio amatissimo Amazfit Bip, dopo 2 anni poverino ha iniziato a cedere; non mentirò: Garmin è stata la mia prima scelta come sinonimo di qualità dei sensori e serietà dell'azienda.La mia prima scelta era il Vivoactive 4 ma trovavo il prezzo proibitivo (mi rendo conto che siano 50€ in più ad oggi) quindi ho continuato ad aspettare che andasse in sconto, poi lui ... neanche a farlo apposta esce questo meraviglioso Venu SQ Music con un form a me più affine (la forma quadrata) e tutti i sensori che volevo (è assente il barometro ma serve a ben poco a me personalmente).L'applicazione non è subito immediata ma devo dire che la trovo graficamente molto gradevole e completa (basta perderci un po' di tempo nel cercare di capirla).L'orologio ha un software molto immediato su di esso e la possibiltà di cambiare la watchface apre un mondo di porte per non stancarti mai del tuo look.Ovviamente non ho potuto testare ogni sua funzione, queste sono quelle che ho provato:- 🏃\u200d♂️Camminata/Corsa all'aperto🏃\u200d♂️: gps preciso e battiti conformi vicini a quelli misurati con una fascia cardio di fascia media- 🚶\u200d♂️Camminata su tapis roulant🚶\u200d♂️: chilometri errati di circa 100 m ma sinceramente non so nemmeno come faccia a calcolare con precisione una cosa del genere! In ogni caso meglio attenersi al proprio tapis!- 🏊\u200d♂️Nuoto🏊\u200d♂️: Sono decisamente un amatore in questo campo, posso solo dirvi che tiene il conto correttamente delle vasche- 💨Esercizi di respirazione💨: piacevoli, durata a scelta e devo dire che li ho trovati abbastanza rilassanti- 🎶Musica🎶: lato musica perfetto, personalmente non ho avuto nessun problema a configurare le playlist, Spotify comodissimo e ha individuato le mie cuffie bluetooth in un attimo. Finalmente posso andare a correre senza il fastidio di dover tenere il telefono in tasca/mano/attaccato al braccio!- 💳GarminPay💳: non c'è molto da dire, funziona perfettamente!Lo ricomprerei senza alcun dubbio!TARGET: Volete avere qualche dato in più sulla vostra attività fisica? Volete avere uno smartwatch carino a vedersi senza spendere 500€? Allora questo è l'orologio che fa per voiCONTRO: Solo la batteria che si scarica in fretta ma devo ammettere che si carica anche piuttosto velocemente quindi 1 oretta in cui state alla scrivania lo potete attaccare e trovarlo al 100%, a me dura circa 3 giorni ma non lo faccio mai arrivare allo 0%"", 'ca fait maintenant 1 semaine que j\'ai cette nouvelle Garmin et j\'ai essayé aussi la VIVOACTIVE 4 juste avant pendant une semaine aussi.au premier coup d’œil, l’écran de la VENU n\'a rien a voir...a coté, la Vivo4 est fade et sans profondeur de couleur.les fonctions sont les meme et le cercle de la montre est plus grand sur la Vivo4 (45 cm contre 43 sur la Venu)Pour moi qui ai un petit poignet, ca compte...Le bracelet aussi est plus petit, 22 mm contre 20 sur la Venu.bien sur, un bel écran comme ca a des défauts notamment sa consommation: je tiens environ 3 jours (etteinte la nuit) en mode ""connecté"". c\'est a dire que la montre est couplée au TPH et les notifications s\'affiche sur la Venu.A noter que je suis aussi en mode always on: l’écran affiche en mode minimaliste l\'heure tout le temps et affiches les autres paramètres quand je tourne mon poignet. ca consomme plus mais je trouve ca plus fun.Avec la vivo4, je tenais 4 jours dans le meme mode. enfin pas tout a fait car l\'always on n\'existe pas mais les pixels sont toujours presents mais non eclairés par le retro éclairage.j\'ai aussi pris un bracelet cuir non Garmin.Il est bien pour tous les jours meme s\'il se détache de temps en temps quand la montre est un peu stressée (quand le poignet bouge fortement et déplace la montre). je pense que le système d’accroche rapide est un poil trop petit et la tension créée a ce moment la fait sauter le bracelet.Il n\'y a pas ce problème avec le bracelet plastique d\'origine.', 'Good features:Screen - the standout feature and the main reason to go for this watch rather than any other Garmin offeringsBattery life - surprisingly good (4-5 days continuous use without always on display) and in any case it charges up really quicklyGPS tracking - rock solid and finds signal very quickly.  It probably gives you at least 10 hours without music.Appearance - looks very goodMobile app - excellent for data vultures like meConnectivity - no problem staying connected to my smartphoneWeight - very light and comfortable to wearActivity tracking - all aspects work well, including plausible step and floor countingPulse Ox tracking - not sure what the point is but it is a lot of funNot so good featuresSleep tracking - doesn\'t do a good job, as it thinks you are sleeping all the time you are in bed.  However, this is common to all Garmin devices.  The Fitbit does a much better job here. This means that the body battery reading which is based partly on sleep data is highly suspect tooNotifications - OK but doesn\'t display icons consistently and there\'s not much possibility of interaction. The Fitbit does a better job hereNo microphone or speaker - Personally I don\'t care but it might be an issue for someScreen bezel a tad on the large side though not noticeable if watch face with dark background selectedPrice - high but you are getting a very good watch for your moneyI\'ve owned many smart and not so smart watches, including Garmin, Pebble, Huawei, Samsung, TicWatch and Fitbit offerings. This is the best one I\'ve owned.  In my opinion, for what it\'s worth, the good massively outweighs the not so good and therefore 5 stars is justified.Possible (cheaper) alternatives:Fitbit Versa 2 - also very good display and sleep tracking is excellent. Notification handling much better. Steps tracking is appalling though and it only has ""connected GPS"". There are also many connectivity problems.Huawei GT Watch 2 - phenomenal battery life and good display but notifications handling is even worse than Garmin, sleep tracking is also suspect and, although workout tracking with GPS is excellent, it cannot be shared with Strava.Garmin Vivoactive 4 - almost the same as the Venu but with transflective (i.e. always on) display and it\'s a bit cheaper.', ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Da parecchi anni ho smartwatch Garmin al polso, soprattutto i modelli Vivoactive che acquisto fin dalla seconda versione. Questa volta volevo provare il tanto decantato schermo amoled del Venu.Lo smartwatch arriva al 100% della carica, quindi ci si può dimenticare della fase di full-charge iniziale perché è già tutto pronto.La configurazione è pressoché immediata se si dispone già di un account Garmin e dell'app Connect installata.In questo caso viene anche proposta la fase di sincronizzazione dei dati (informazioni anagrafiche, attività, obiettivi, etc...).Rispetto a Vivoactive si può scorrere tutte le informazioni in un'unica schermata, mentre sul Vivoactive ogni funzionalità occupava tutto il quadrante. Non sono sicuro di apprezzare questa organizzazione ma usando l'orologio mi ci abituerò in qualche modo.L'interazione con l'interfaccia è molto fluida tranne nel passaggio tra un quadrante e l'altro, quando si seleziona il prescelto tra le opzioni disponibili: poco male.Una delusione sono i quadranti disponibili di default: sono davvero pochi e non particolarmente interessanti visivamente anche se ovviamente si può attingere allo store di Garmin. Oltre a questo,  i campi dei quadranti non possono essere editati.L'editor parte invece da un quadrante vuoto al quale aggiungere tutte le varie componenti: dati, lancette, sfondo e così via.Mi sono bloccato inizialmente nella prima sincronizzazione con Garmin Connect perché dopo qualche secondo si interrompeva andando in errore. Il motivo dell'errote era che ildisplay del telefono android andava in standby dopo 15 secondo e questo bloccava la sincronizzazione.La soluzione è tenere il display sempre attivo per 15-20 minuti in modo che la procedura si chiuda senza intoppi.Il punto debole di questo smartwatch, come riportato anche i molti siti specializzati è il fatto che la durata della batteria è veramente bassa con il display always-on. Si può però utilizzare il l'orologio in modalità Vivoactive:  col display sempre attivo ma con i gest disattivati.In questo modo il quadrante sempre attivo in modalità molto soft e in risparmio energetico.Il cinturino ed il quadrante (quello fisico) sono ottimi, eredità del modello precedente.In generale il mio consiglio personale è quello di aspettare il Vivoactive 5 perché lo schermo amoled non giustifica una durata della batteria così bassa ed un prezzo così elevato.Dopo anni di evoluzione degli smartwatch, dover ancora fare mille trucchetti per risparmiare batteria sa tanto di amarcord degli anni '90-2000 quando la tecnologia c'era ma era ancora molto acerba."", 'Generally a good all round product. Only discovering half of what this watch can actually do.  Everything apart from the sleep cycle is reasonably accurate. And works incredibly well under waterHowever my biggest gripe is the materials used to make the watch. Both the screen and watch surround are showing more scratches and general  wear after several months than my old apple watch series 1 did after several years, which is unacceptable for a premium product.', ""I deeply regret buying this. The battery life is so short so a day's readings can never be accurate and unless you display the heart rate on the watch face (which uses even more battery) you can't even see the reading whilst exercising. This is bad for older people who need to make sure their heart rate is not being exceeded on something like a treadmill - the watch face just goes blank after seconds and the touch screen often does not respond. For such an expensive item I found the cheap plastic wrist strap hard on my wrist and to even get a reading it has to be worn quite tightly which causes discomfort. I would return it for a refund but stupidly threw the box away before really testing the product properly - I assumed it would live up to all the hype."", 'Had this watch for a week. Brought as update for vio fit. The only thing better on this watch is the display so paid 350 for a screen upgrade.Battery life about 3 days if you use GPS a lot which I do for running and other activities.

The app store is effectively useless with this watch.Because of this and limited pre loaded apps this not a smart watch. You can get a fitness tracker that will do all this for £50 with a good display I am seriously considering returning as not fit for described purpose 😡😡', 'Fratello minore del Venu tondo, perde delle funzioni a mio avviso superflue per chi vuole la sostanza, nonché lo schermo amoled a favore di un LCD, ma c\'è differenza nell\'uso quotidiano? NO, il primo ha sicuramente un impatto visivo maggiore, ma il secondo è ben più che visibile e definito. Perde il barometro questo fattore è soggettivo se utile o meno, come lo è il fatto di non essere completamente in acciaio inossidabile, questo significa che è delicato? NO, al tatto si percepisce la solidità. Il touch risponde molto bene al tocco in linea generale. Non c\'è lo schermo sempre acceso, indispensabile? NO se l\'orologio ha un buon sensore del movimento, e questo ce l\'ha. Per il resto la sensoristica è la medesima, qualità Garmin quale non ha bisogno di descrizione. Il GPS è rapido nella recezione del segnale, le notifiche arrivano puntuali ed è facile rispondere(al momento nei gruppi WhatsApp NON si può rispondere). L\'estetica è soggettiva ma, a mio avviso, sembra che l\'azienda non l\'abbia affatto trascurata. Traendo le conclusioni, un ottimo sportwatch con funzioni smart, al polso è leggerissimo, ottimo anche per chi si approccia per la prima volta in questo mondo, l\'azienda ha voluto alleggerire su quello che poteva pensando più alla praticità che alla forma, questo lo porta ad avere un prezzo \'leggero\' per le potenzialità offerteAGGIORNAMENTOdopo 3 mesi di utilizzo ci sono stati diversi aggiornamenti, tra cui la possibilità di rispondere sui gruppi Whatsapp vedendo chi ha scritto cosa, è migliorata l\'usabilità generale, ma una cosa che ancora mi ""pesa"" è la scarsa adesione con le banche per GarminPay. Al di là di questo neo, ad oggi sono ancora soddisfatto dell\'acquisto', 'Ich habe relativ lange nach einer für mich passenden Smartwatch gesucht. Das bedeutet für mich: Eindeutiger Fokus auf Sport und Gesundheit, ansprechendes Design und nicht ""nur ein Fitnessarmband, ein Akku der mehrere Tage durchhält und ein ordentliches Display. Mit der Venu hatte ich den perfekten Fit gefunden - dachte ich zumindest.Für mich konnte ich eindeutige Stärken und Schwächen feststellen. Die möchte ich nun einmal in Bereiche unterteilen.==================Design & Tragekomfort==================Natürlich ein sehr subjektiver Punkt. Ich finde die Uhr optisch sehr ansprechend. Auch den Tragekomfort fand ich sehr angenehm, was für eine Uhr, die man auch beim Schlafen trägt durchaus wichtig ist. Teilweise kritisiert wurde, dass die Uhr zu großen Teilen aus Plastik ist. Das stimmt und bei rund 380€ kann ich die Kritik teilweise nachvollziehen. Wenn jedoch bedacht wird, dass die Uhr eine Sport-/Allrounderuhr ist, finde ich die Prioritäten gut gesetzt. Den Punkt Design & Tragekomfort würde ich als klare Stärke einordnen.=======Akku=======Der Akku ist auf jeden Fall ein Punkt, bei dem diese Uhr der Konkurrenz voraus ist. Allerdings zehrt auch jede kleine Einstellung am Akku. Niemand stellt die Uhr auf die dunkelste Helligkeitsstufe und deaktiviert fast alle Features. Display etwas heller gestellt -> Akku runter, Auto-Synchronisation -> Akku runter, SpO2 Sensor nicht dauerhaft aus -> Akku runter. Von den beworbenen 5 Tagen bleiben realistisch ca. 3 Tage. Mit nachts aktiven SpO2-Sensor, 5 Aktivitäten pro Woche und 3/4-Displayhelligkeit geht es auf ca. 2 bis 2,5 Tage runter. Ich würde den Punkt als kleine Stärke sehen. Man hätte die Marketing-Keule aber etwas realistischer ansetzen können.=========Funktionen=========Insgesamt wie gesagt ein Sportallrounder. Die Features sind hauptsächlich Sportfokussiert mit kleineren, alltagstauglichen Smartwatch-Funktionen. Einiges ist jedoch eher Spielerei. Der SpO2-Sensor ist z.B. nicht so in der App implementiert, dass er spürbaren Nutzen bringt. Als bisher non-Garmin-Nutzer fand ich auch die Body Battery Funktion sehr spannend. Auch die hat sich für mich persönlich jedoch eher als Spielerei entpuppt. Mit den Funktionen war ich insgesamt zufrieden. Die Aktivitätsaufzeichnung ist gut und detailliert. Was ich mir gewünscht hätte, ist eine Verarbeitung der Details zu einem Score, ähnlich wie es Fitbit macht. Da bin ich mir nicht sicher, ob ich stets zu blind war das zu finden oder ob es keine simple Zusammenfassung gibt.Insgesamt für mich ein solider Punkt, allerdings nichts, was die Uhr ausmacht.=========Sensoren=========Dieser Punkt ist in meinem Fall die absolute Achillessehne der Uhr. Den mäßig sinnvollen SpO2-Sensor habe ich bereits erwähnt. Allerdings sind auch restliche Messungen bei meiner Uhr absolut Katastrophal gewesen. D.h. die Uhr hatte eine sehr seltsame Interpretation meines Schlafes. Oft soll ich schon um 19:00 Uhr eingeschlafen sein. War ich um 02:30 Uhr wach, war das egal. Je nachdem habe ich dort angeblich leicht oder in der REM-Phase geschlafen. Das hat sich dazu entwickelt, dass nicht die Uhr meinen Schlaf, sondern ich die Uhr überwacht habe. Treppen wurden inkorrekt gezählt. Ich habe mich einen Tag nur im Haus bewegt. Sprich jede Treppe nach oben = Treppe nach unten. Gemessen: 16 Treppen hoch, 22 runter. Beim Stress war ich bei einer anstrengend Innenstadt-Autofahrt absolut tiefenentspannt, aber beim Abend vorm Fernseher war ich wohl panisch gestresst. Bei bisherigen Fitnessuhren hatte ich einen Ruhepuls von 49-53. Damals habe ich noch mehr Sport gemacht. Trotz heute weniger Sport attestiert mir die Venu einen Ruhepuls von 42-47.Diese Fehler haben mich dazu bewegt, die Uhr zurückzusenden.======Fazit======Die Uhr ist ein passender Allrounder, mit noch einigermaßen akzeptablen Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis. Das wäre mein Fazit, wenn die Messungen funktioniert hätten. Ich weiß nicht, ob es nur an meinem Gerät lag. An mir sollte es nicht liegen, bei allen bisherigen Uhren hatte ich zumindest nie derartige Probleme. Mit dem absoluten Totalausfall in Sachen Sensoren ist die Venu meiner Erfahrung nach eine schlechte Wahl. Soetwas sollte bei dem Preis auch nicht im Ausnahmefall vorkommen.', ""Do yourself a favour and avoid the seller I used (they were (likely still are) in Spain) so I got hit for import tax, I tried to cancel once I realised but they were extremely unhelpful.

The Garmin App is also great and links to my fitness pal app so I can check my calorie intake etc. The battery life is OK but does depend on how you set the watch up based on the setting I have the watch will last around 3-4 days .I would recommend this watch', ""J'ai reçu cette montre connectée il y a deux jours .

En parlant de musique ce qui m'a fait écarter la Fitbit c'est qu'on ne peut télécharger des listes musicales qu'à partir de Deezer ou Amazon et seulement piloter Spotify sur votre portable  et que je suis abonnée à Spotify . Avec la Venu sq musique vous pourrez télécharger des titres à partir de Spotify , Deezer Amazon entre autres et votre propre musique ( semble t'il , j'ai pas encore essayé ) . Sinon la montre est très complète avec plein d'exercices qu'on peut surveiller dont l'elliptique , le tapis en salle , et le vélo en salle ( à condition de disposer d'un accessoire compteur de vitesse ou de cadence à fixer sur le vélo , j'attends le mien ) . Sinon au niveau des paramètres physiologiques , c'est très complet avec des choses amusantes comme le niveau de stress ou le compteur d'énergie interne . Dans ce qui compte vraiment les pulsations sont  justes ( j'ai controlé ) et le sommeil aussi dans la mesure ou on se couche pour dormir et qu'on se lève d'un bond d'un seul , sans flemmarder , ni lire , ni surveiller tristement les statistiques du Covid sur sa tablette .... l'oxymétrie nécessite une immobilité absolue pour bien fonctionner .Une chose est sure c'est que cette montre  occupe , meme avec une grosse habitude des logiciels informatiques la régler pour l'adapter à vos possibilités sportives est quand meme un peu compliqué et le manuel d'utilisation téléchargeable aide mais n'explique pas tout . Ceci dit j'ai eu un petit souci avec un écran de veille dont je n'arrivais pas à me débarrasser , un petit coup de chat avec  Garmin et c'était arrangé . Donc vous n'etes pas seul !! Il y a aussi le site IQ Connect ou vous pourrez télécharger des cadrans et des applications dont Spotify  , la plupart gratuites . Coté esthétique , elle est vraiment élégante meme si un peu grosse pour mes petits poignets , mais l'écran est bien lisible . Coté batterie c'est comme de tout , si vous la sollicitez beaucoup il faudra la charger souvent . Je suis donc satisfaite de mon achat , mais pour les personne peu habituées aux méandres des logiciels informatiques  mieux vaut à mon avis opter pour des modèles plus simples."", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Como resumen en el vídeo comento lo siguiente:- Es la versión en azul granito, aunque es más gris que otra cosa.- Tiene 43 mm de esfera, el tamaño perfecto.- La pantalla AMOLED le da un plus de calidad, siendo más interesantes los watchfaces.- Ciertos watchfaces cargan lento, algo que fastidia la experiencia.- Autonomía de unos 4-5 días sin problema.

Sie sieht gut aus, das Display ist sehr gut ablesbar, Touch-Bedienung funktioniert auch gut, sie ist deutlich leichter als meine bisherige Fenix 5s.Ich habe die Uhr trotzdem retourniert weil:1. Akkulaufzeit - ich hatte die Uhr von Freitag Mittag bis Samstag Abend in Verwendung und musste zwei Mal den Akku aufladen. Auch wenn durch die Einrichtung der Uhr einiges an Energie verbraucht wird ist eine derart kurze Akkulaufzeit nicht akzeptabel.2. ständige Verbindungsprobleme: die Bluetoothverbindung zwischen Uhr und Handy war permanent unterbrochen und musste wieder neu hergestellt werden - vermutlich auch ein Grund für die kurze Akkulaufzeit.2. Synchronisation mit der App funktioniert nicht wirklich. Mal werden die Daten von der Uhr in der App angezeigt, dann wieder nicht.3. Nachrichten vom Handy kommen mal auf der Uhr an, dann wieder nicht. (klar - ist ja auch die Bluetooth-Verbindung ständig weg)4. WLAN Verbindung: Bei einrichtung von Amazon Music auf der Uhr konnte zwar die angelegte Playlist angezeigt werden, wollte ich diese aber abspielen war plötzlich keine Verbindung mit dem WLAN da. Wie kann dann die Playlist angezeigt werden, wenn keine WLAN-Verbindung vorhanden ist?5. Die Bluetooth-Verbindung mit den Kopfhörern war schlicht nicht hinzubekommen.So ist die Uhr leider unbrauchbar.Möglich, dass es sich um Kinderkrankheiten handelt, da die Uhr ja gerade erst erschienen ist.

I have upgraded from a forerunner 35. I was toying about this since it was released and after reading DC Rainmakers review I went for it. Easy to use and setup. Overall for the activities that I do, I am very happy.', 'Premetto che ho dovuto richiedere la sostituzione del primo campione in quanto si spegneva da solo senza motivo.Aspetti Positivi: è un bell\'orologio esteticamente, di dimensioni generose senza essere un padellone da 46mm che sinceramente trovo poco elegante anche per chi ha un polso come il mio per nulla esile. E\' fatto di materiali di qualità e ben refinito, per cui averlo al polso fa un bell\'effetto. Ed gli aspetti positivi finiscono qui.Aspetti Negativi: la betteria non dura i 5-6 gg dichiarati. Se si vuole avere un orologio che durante l\'arco della giornata e nottata collezioni i vari dati (battito, stress, sonno ecc), che quando si legge l\'ora lo schermo non si spenga dopo 1 secondo, o che comunque funzioni al massimo delle propri potenzialità, allora la durata si riduce a massimo 2 gg. Io ogni volta che mi faccio la doccia lo metto in ricarica almeno per 1 ora al giorno per sicurezza. Poi la navigazione... molto deludente. Prima avevo un Galaxi della Samsung che ritenevo un orologio inferiore al blasonato Garmin.. in realtà era molto più efficiente e funzionale. Mi data dati costanti e precisi senza troppe complicazioni.. Questo Garmin sembra lento di comprendonio... non capisce che mi sto allenando per cui ogni volta dovrei dire che ho iniziato un allenamento affinchè registri sforzo, calorie ecc.. Una cosa che non trovo concepibile da uno ""smart"" watch. Poi il tanto decantato display Amoled non è nulla di speciale anzi. Diciamo che è poco luminoso (proprio la caratteristica che invece dovrebbe contraddistinguerlo). Alle volte faccio fatica a leggere l\'ora. Il Samsung che avevo era molto più visibile e chiaro nella lettura dell\'ora e dei dati.Insomma sono stato deluso dall\'acquisto, ma ormai me lo tengo come orologio che mi da solo ora e qualche altro dato superfluo. Non lo consiglio per gli atleti.', ""I ordered this with high hopes yet became bitterly disappointed. It became clear very soon on that this watch has been released far too early, probably in an attempt to fashion itself against other smart fitness watches...Their issue is... It just isn't smart! The software is largely flawed in the fact that they've tried to write their own, leading to key advertised features just not being ready for market as it's 'still in development' such as the NFC...My bank reportedly wasn't supported... Natwest ie. RBS, one of the largest in the UK.The battery life too; not adequate and the screen, to say it's a flagship smart watch for the company featuring an AMOLED screen... Do yourself a favour Garmin and invest in the software to show off this screen please! There's no point if you supply customers with low res graphics.You either have the watch screen on constantly giving you extremely poor battery life or you have it activate upon a wrist turn... The latter would be brilliant, if it was as responsive as you'd expect... But alas, it disappointed. Again.This watch is not worth even the lower price tag of £290 that I paid.I've resorted to buying the little known Honor Magic Watch 2 for half the price which gives me a stunning screen, accurate continuous fitness readings, music control and... TWO WEEKS BATTERY LIFE.100% paying for the brand here and not the tech/software. Disappointing to say the least."", ""Having had several Wear OS devices the battery life has always been a downside. I like the ability to monitor my notifications, heart and GPS track walks. With these 3 requirements and extended battery life I started to look at fitness trackers and Garmin.This device is superb, I cannot fault it.The options to track are vast, there is pulse oxygen, hydration, sleep, stress, intensity and more. It has the ability to track workouts I didn't know existed and even provides some videos / animation on how to perform the activity correctly.Of my main criteria I was looking at:Monitor Notifications - Through the app you can select which apps from your phone send notifications through to the device which is good at limiting the notifications to what you needHeart rate - Constantly tracked with improved accuracy against my previous Wear OS deviceGPS tracking - this is extremely accurate however it doesn't link directly to Viewranger which I was using previously, now needs to export the GPX file to have everything in ViewrangerBattery life - Running the device I appear to be getting a stable 7-8days with some GPS tracking within that. Once a week charge works fine and is a big improvement from almost daily on Wear OS.Lastly, the Garmin Connect and Connect IQ apps are a must. They take some navigating and a while to understand purely due to so much being available. The graphically analysis of all the tracking is superb. The Connect IQ is more of an app store which allows you to find additional tracking options, music storage and watch faces. After several itterations of watch face I have found a minimal look which still provides plenty of top level details (Summit Watch Face V2).If you're looking for your next wearable and questioning whether to go with Garmin vs Other options I highly recommend you go with the Garmin!"", 'Read lots of reviews on this before I bought it as it’s a lot of money but I think it’s worth it. Very comfortable to wear, lots of information viewable on the watch which you can swipe through. Display is brilliant.and the accuracy seems to be excellent. I would buy it again. My one slight gripe is I don’t have the constant display on to save battery, so to display you raise your arm to look, I think the display time is slightly too short.

Sometimes it doesn't pick up sleeping data at all. Very slow synchronization since the last update and I'm constantly on chat support because the watch makes its own decisions - it removes data displays or changes settings. The touch screen is so unresponsive, you have to tap it 8-10 times sometimes for the watch to come on. When cycling, there's no display for kcal used only heart rate and time passed, you can only see the overall calories for the workout once synced, this is not useful for weight loss. I get notifications regularly that I just hit my step target when doing the dishes or washing my hair. The most bothering error is when doing high impact cycling, barely alive, and the watch showes my heartrate at 120 (should be above 160) and it doesn't change one bit for half an hour. This results in showing an activity normally measure around / above 500 kcal to be 200 at best. The battery lasts 3 days at best. Disconnects from phone 100 times a day. In addition, the strap caused a really bad irritation to my skin.

E' anche touch screen ma non hanno messo il movimento da destra verso sinistra...(perchè non lo avete messo????). La navigazione del menù è abbastanza scandalosa rispetto ad altri orologi. Ha diversi lag! (nulla a che vedere con apple watch o Suunto7) Ottimo il discorso della musica tramite Amazon o Spotify che invece molti altri orologi non hanno. Ottimo il fatto del display always on. La batteria ha una discreta durata. Il cinturino abbastanza piccolo ma confortevole e traspirante. Ottima la connessione con la App sul telefono e la wifi integrata per gli aggiornamenti. Non adatto a sport estremi e per donne che hanno un posto piccolo. Non so se lo ricomprerei adesso che è uscito il Suunto 7 soprattuto per il fatto del display che a me personalmente risulta un po' difficile da leggere soprattuto nelle notifiche. Consigliato a chi ci vede bene o a chi porta sempre gli occhiali, a chi vuole un orologio leggero e confortevole di giorno che di notte, a chi non fa sport estremi e chi vuole sentire musica durante l'allenamento lasciando il telefono a casa.

Ich kann es nicht nachvollziehen, dass die Uhr in Verbindung mit Handschuhen oder anderen Wristbands durch die auf der rechten Seite liegenden Knöpfe ausgelöst wird, da diese Uhr auch jederzeit gesperrt werden kann und erst durch langes gedrückt halten einer der Knöpfe entsperrt werden kann. Ebenso wurden bei mir noch keine Schritte im Schlaf getrackt allerdings kann man die Schritte tatsächlich einfach durch vor und zurück bewegen des Arms im stehen oder sitzen schnell nachstellen.Was ich teilweise nervig fand war, dass ich der Garmin Connect App Zugriff auf mein gesamtes Handy geben musste und sonst täglich mehrfach damit genervt wurde.

I love the GPS position widget, which will be really handy on a trail, if you get lost, or are reading a map in bad weather.This watch is stylish, fits well, and is a bonus being waterproof, it only leaves my wrist when it needs charging.

Warum?- Tolles und helles Display. Meine vorherige Uhr hatte schon ein AMOLED Display und ich wollte wieder eines haben. Garmin hat nach meiner Meinung ein gutes verbaut und es schaut echt gut aus.- GPS: ich habe beim Joggen beide Uhren miteinander verglichen und dann die aufgezeichneten Strecken auf der Karte miteinander verglichen. Die Venu ist wesentlich genauer.- Leicht: ein Metallgehäuse hört sich zwar gut an, ich habe für mich aber gemerkt, dass es beim Sport eher von Nachteil ist weil die Uhr viel schneller verrutscht (ist einfach mehr Gewicht was in Bewegung gerät). Tja und durch das verrutschen kann man die Pulsmessung  dann vergessen. Die Venue merkt man kaum am Handgelenk, verrutscht dadurch weniger und ich vertraue der Pulsmessung mehr.- Pulsmessung: siehe Punkt ""leicht"" + passt schon. Den Vergleich mit einem Brustgurt habe ich noch nicht gemacht aber der Eindruck ist gut.- Benachrichtigungen und Sync. mit dem Telefon: funktioniert so wie es soll- Akku: dazu sage ich einfach nur SUPER! Wie gesagt, die Uhr ist am Dienstag angekommen und nach 60 Stunden inkl. Einrichtung, Update, Ausprobieren, 2 Sporteinheiten, Pulsmessung ist immer an etc. hat die Uhr noch 63% Akku. Nachts trage ich die Uhr übrigens nicht.Zusammenfassung: bisher voll und ganz zufrieden.Update 24.10: immer noch voll zufrieden.  Akku: ich lade die Uhr mittlerweile einmal in der Woche am Sonntag....würde aber auch noch einen Tag mehr laufen :-)', 'Ich bin von der Forerunner 235 gewechselt und hatte schon eine Weile die venu als den Nachfolger auserkoren.  Als diese dann mit schneller Lieferzeit verfügbar war, habe ich direkt über Amazon bestellt. Eins Vorweg: ich habe mein Exemplar nach 4 Tagen zurückgesendet.Der erste Anschein ist echt toll. Das Display ist Welten besser, als das von der Forerunner und die Bedienung über den Touchscreen ist intuitiv. Die Qualität und die Verarbeitung lässt keine Wünsche übrig. Also stellt sich die Frage, warum ich die Uhr zurückgesandt habe.1.) Garmin nutzt das tolle Display meines Erachtens nicht. Außer einer besseren Darstellung, sehe ich nicht mehr Informationen als bei meiner Forerunner. Ich hatte gehofft, dass ich irgendeine Karte darstellen kann (siehe Fenix 5), aber das alles geht nicht. Außerdem schaltet sich das Display immer wieder aus um Strom zu sparen. Das ist nach dem Umstieg von dem immer anzeigenden Display der Forerunner sehr merkwürdig.2.) Ich nutze die Uhr vor allem zum Lauftraining und erstelle beim Start über die Uhr z.B.: eine Intervalleinheit. Die Option wurde gestrichen. Ich kann nur noch vorab über den PC/Smartphone geplante Trainings absolvieren.3.) Ich hatte etwas mehr Smartwatch erwartet. Meine Whatsapp Nachrichten werden immer noch nicht dargestellt. Es wird nur der Name der Person angezeigt. Bei Mails oder anderen Mitteilungen sieht man etwas mehr, aber halt genau so viel, wie ich vorher auf der Forerunner 235 gesehen habe.Alles in allem war mir die bessere Darstellung der gleichen Inhalte wie auf der Forerunner und die fehlende Option zur Erstellung des Trainings der ausschlaggebende Punkt.

You can't filter on Garmin apps for example so have to trawl through all the 3rd party apps to find them.

Con meno di 200€ vi portate a casa il dispositivo più completo per questa fascia di prezzo. E con gli ultimi aggiornamenti è migliorato ancora di più.Certo, è più uno sportwatch che smartwatch, quindi a fluidità non aspettatevi chissà cosa, ma si sa, Garmin ha questo OS anche su orologi da più di 700€.  È una filosofia che da priorità all\'affidabilità dei sensori e dei dati piuttosto che al sistema ""fighetto"".Il display è buono (ho visto di meglio senza dubbio), colori ben equilibrati e neri abbastanza neri (ovviamente essendo un LCD non aspettatevi neri al pari di un amoled). Risoluzione un po\' bassina, ma i dati si leggono bene in ogni condizione. Un amoled sarebbe stato perfettoPer ora è lo smartwatch/sportwatch più equilibrato che abbia mai provato.Senza dubbio.', ""This watch for the most part is good for the price. It has an attractive, intuitive display and lots of useful features.The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because it has had a couple of issues syncing specific workouts. For example if I do two activities in a day one may sync and the other won't. This isn't good enough for a £180 watch and Garmin's advice on how to upload these unsynced activities is convoluted and requires a laptop.Overall, I'm happy enough with the watch, but it clearly has some issues that need to be rectified."", ""I ordered this with high hopes yet became bitterly disappointed. It became clear very soon on that this watch has been released far too early, probably in an attempt to fashion itself against other smart fitness watches...Their issue is... It just isn't smart! The software is largely flawed in the fact that they've tried to write their own, leading to key advertised features just not being ready for market as it's 'still in development' such as the NFC...My bank reportedly wasn't supported... Natwest ie. RBS, one of the largest in the UK.The battery life too; not adequate and the screen, to say it's a flagship smart watch for the company featuring an AMOLED screen... Do yourself a favour Garmin and invest in the software to show off this screen please! There's no point if you supply customers with low res graphics.You either have the watch screen on constantly giving you extremely poor battery life or you have it activate upon a wrist turn... The latter would be brilliant, if it was as responsive as you'd expect... But alas, it disappointed. Again.This watch is not worth even the lower price tag of £290 that I paid.I've resorted to buying the little known Honor Magic Watch 2 for half the price which gives me a stunning screen, accurate continuous fitness readings, music control and... TWO WEEKS BATTERY LIFE.100% paying for the brand here and not the tech/software. Disappointing to say the least."", ""Garmin Venu (posh version review)This is a great watch with a couple of problems. The display is a big improvement on the always on but pretty dull Vivoactive HR, The way it gets round the extra power draw of the OLED is by activating it when you turn it to your face or if there is a notification. There is a pronounced delay when it does this making it impossible to just glance at it like you would with a normal watch. The buttons aren't that well thought out. I've triggered the activity stop button mid workout when the edge of my glove pushes up my wrist. You can mitigate this by loosening it and pushing it up your arm a bit before you get going.However, the functionality is very good. Much better sensors, it can track breathing and blood oxygen. It communicates much better over bluetooth than the Vivioactive HR. The GPS seems more accurate and I get much better altitude change precision with it.Battery life is good unless you engage the PulseOX blood oxygen level tracking at which point you'll be lucky if you get two days out of it.Overall, great watch, well worth it. Get plugs for the charger port though or it will clog."", 'I upgraded from vivoactive HR 3. I have to say display is much prettier but much less functional. Watch is:- hard to wake up during day use- not responsive for scrolling- can’t turn off the light at night and when I move it wake up and... wake me up with light- I have allergic reaction to silicon watch band included with the watch (I own Garmin watches since 2015 and didn’t have this issue with any of the previous models)Good sides:- battery lifeI think I wouldn’t buy it just for the display. At the moment Garmin call centre is down couple of days so can’t get help with the watch band... maybe this is just one off.If you consider smart watch, vivoactive 3 or 4 has the same functions and are better value for money. Only new thing is ox tracking, that kills the only advantage of the watch which is battery life... body battery is useless feature (don’t think it actually shows true data, I base it on 3 weeks experience with the watch). This device is simply not worth £300', ""I found the touch screen frustratingly poor. Sometimes having to touch the screen 5 or 6 times to register and scroll left or right 3 -5 time before the screen scrolled. I also found the watch faces very poor and you have to use 2 different apps just to install one. It didn't integrate well with my iPhone. It worked OK but seemed very basic in functions. When I sent it back I decided to buy an Apple watch which unfortunately cost about £240 more! But wow, what an amazing difference, like swapping a Fiat Panda for a Merc. It's arguably unfair to compare 2 products with such a price difference but I think if you have an iPhone you need an Apple watch. Apple seem to ensure that's the case by possibly restricting competitive products?"", 'il monitoraggio degli sport va abbastanza bene, tuttavia ci sono numerosi problemi:-sincronizzazione molto lenta e spesso non va a buon fine-monitoraggio del sonno completamente sballato, vengono sempre aggiunte numerose ore e il sonno profondo risulta praticamente assente in ogni misurazione-in posizione supina il quadrante non si accende con il movimento del polso anche se non si sta dormendopossono sembrare piccolezze, ma pensavo che garmin fosse garanzia di perfezione', 'The good things (won\'t take long) - you can connect both an android phone and iPhone using the Garmin Connect app- nice form factor, very light and comfortable to wear- very good battery life if you don\'t use GPS all the time- for serious runners there is a huge choice of data recording and analysis features...too much for a light runner like meThe bad things- poor selection of watch faces with little option to modify the data points- screen is disappointing, way behind that on the apple watch and Samsung Active 2- screen shows signs of being laggy when swiping, it can be unresponsive and makes the whole experience feel like a let down- the screen on mine would dim for no reason, then pulse bright and dim for no reason, I\'m sure it must have been faulty in some respect- on both my iPhone and Xperia 1, it would refuse to install/transfer watch faces across from the Connect IQ application and was very temperamentalThe Samsung Active 2 which I also have is far better if you are looking for a watch which is ""smarter"" but not as good as the Garmin for exercise stuff. It has a vastly superior screen.Overall, rather disappointed by the experience, I\'m not sure this smart watch is actually ready as there are too many little niggles and annoyances with the screen and software.', 'I am upgrading from the Garmin Vivoactive HR and decided on the Venu mainly due to the display. I found it increasingly difficult to read the display on the Vivoactive and heard the Bright Touchscreen on the Venu would be a good upgrade. The watch comes with a lot more widgets and apps than the old one, and the interface is slightly quirkier to get round. The display is bright and easily readable. The animations are a good touch and make for a more interesting view. So far, my activities have been limited to walking and some weights at home. The walking mode is spoiled by the time it takes to activate the GPS. My old watch would take about 20 - 30 seconds this one takes up to 5 minutes to get a connection. Why? Not sure but it does let the whole package down slightly. Otherwise, it would be 5 stars. The battery life is what I would expect from Garmin and far superior to any other watch I have used. I like to view the walks I have done afterwards and the Garmin Connect on the web is a great and to me essential touch. Hear I can view all the stats and customize the look of the page to show only the items I am interested in. If the Venu lasts as long as my Vivoactive then I will be very happy.', 'Después de usar un vivoactive 3 durante casi dos años me había habituado al ecosistema de garmin y quería repetir con otro de sus dispositivos, por esa razón aquí estoy, contando mi experiencia con este nuevo reloj de garmin (durante solo un día, es lo que tardé en decidirme a devolverlo).Estéticamente es bonito, no se puede negar y hasta aquí sus virtudes.Pantalla:Particularmente me gusta mirar al reloj y encontrarme con la hora sin tener que hacer ejercicios de contorsionismo con la muñeca, no obstante podría haber vivido con ello, nunca viene mal ejercitar la flexibilidad. Lo que me hace menos gracia es no poder ver con claridad los campos de datos, que por cierto solo se visualizarán 3 como máximo, durante mis entrenamientos, además de por su tamaño también porque la pantalla brilla poco, al menos si está configurada para estar siempre encendida durante una actividad.En cualquier caso la pantalla cuando estas interaccionando, dicho sea de paso es bastante imprecisa, con ella o miras la hora (después de tu sesión de ejercicios de muñeca) se ve suficientemente bien.Precisión del posicionamiento (GPS):Un absoluto horror. Entreno en una pista de atletismo y lo que se supone debería de ser un ovalo....parecía...si ok, un ovalo pero pintado por un niño de 2 años, configurado con el gps + glonass, tal como viene por defecto.Sincronización con garmin connect:Este apartado es otro absoluto despropósito, mientras que mi antiguo vivoactive tardaba apenas unos segundos en sincronizar un entrenamiento este venu..yo no se ni el tiempo que tardó, fue desesperante, eso si, terminó haciéndolo.Pulsómetro:Yo creo que no va mal del todo, lo que pasa que yo muevo mucho los brazos en mis entrenamientos y no es nada preciso, nunca he probado un reloj que lo fuese conmigo.Batería:Diría que esto es lo peor de todo. Cargué el reloj la noche anterior al único entreno que realicé con él, por la mañana estaba al 95%, me pareció correcto, pero al terminar de entrenar (después de 1 hora y 45 minutos aproximadamente) ya contaba con un 73% de capacidad, lo que me habría supuesto tener que cargarlo cada dos días, en un año lo mismo tengo que cargarlo todos los días...no lo veo yo claro.Conclusiones.En general tienes la sensación cuando lo usas que es un producto en el que se ha recordado muchísimo y que no me lo esperaba después de haber leído unas cuentas reviews antes de adquirirlo. Dicho de forma mas sencilla, se nota un dispositivo mal concebido, de baja calidad si lo preferís.Teniendo en cuenta de que vas a pagar cerca de 200€ por él y ya habiendo mencionado todos estos defectos que yo encontré, que considero capitales, no me parece que sea una buena inversión en absoluto, por poco mas te puedes comprar un 245 que muy previsiblemente funcionará muchísimo mejor, todo esto teniendo en cuenta de que quien se compra un garmin es porque le gusta el deporte.', ""I've been a longstanding Garmin customer for a few years and have had fenix 6s as well as this watch so I think I'm in a position to make an honest from comparable comparison. I guess the pros to the venuel is the fact that it's extremely light and you don't even notice it on your wrist compared to the phoenix that was like a tank and weighed nearly 100 g and always felt very heavy.  The venu has very good battery life typically from normal use as well as basic navigation back to a hotel so you typically get between 3 to 4 days unlike some whates such as the Samsung watch 4 for which I had literally would give me 48 hours at a very maximum so top marks the Garmin for the battery life. To watch itself is pretty good it's not as probably as feature full as a Samsung watch but it does give you your health age as well as runs a bunch of diagnostics to test HRV blood pressure fitness levels etc etc and does a pretty good job of this. The Garmin connect app is excellent and works seamlessly with the watch and is not always requesting to pair with the watch and you can set it in such a way that you just open the app periodically to download the data which is far better for the watches battery life.I use the watch for fishing quite a bit and it's fully waterproof I've been out to Madeira fishing recently and it's water to proof and salt proof and I've had no issues with that although I don't use it for diving. I found it hard to get a screen protector to protect the watch as it has a slight curvature on the screen so you can only really use the plastic silicone covers which are not hard glass or in any way as effective as a proper screen protecter say for the fenix 6r.I guess the cons to this watch the main reason is the fact that it does not have maps and does not have built in decent navigation where you can actually go for a hike and add a GPX route to the watch in order to get a basic trail.  It does allow some form of navigation where you can store navigation point say your base or your home and it will give you an arrow pointer towards that set location but it will not allow you to import a trail that someone else's walked and follow that trail but I guess that is why it costs significantly less than the fenix 6 and it is as I say a fitness watch and not really a navigation hiking watch.Overall I'm pretty pleased to watch I've had a bunch of smart watches and I must say this is the best for the money and it feels really good on the wrist and not very heavy and has most of the features that I would like I think if I had to criticize it as I say it will be having navigation with maps would make it an awesome contender for best smartwatchThanks"", 'The watch itself for me was an upgrade from the Garmin Forerunner 235. It’s touch screen and looks great. Garmin are an excellent fitness watch range. I use it mainly for running however it does have other activities in it you can do. I’ve not investigated too much into other features to be fair other than change the watch face which is very easy to do. You can have messages on it from a smart phone however you cannot reply like a Samsung or Apple one.There was one time I was doing a tough mudder and it sent it into a hissy fit twice wanting to make an emergency call for whatever reason but I’ve still not found out why.Overall, it’s a great device and looks great. The accuracy is excellent, it’s easy to use, and I’m sure you would love it also', 'Premetto che ho comprato il Garmin Venu 2 per sostituire un Apple Watch 3 che improvvisamente si è rotto, pertanto tutti i paragoni saranno fatti con questo ultimo. Ho scelto il Venu 2 dopo lunghe ricerche e pensando soprattutto all\'utilizzo che faccio dello smartwatch. Faccio quotidianamente sport (CrossFit, corsa, padel, tennis) e mi piace avere tutti i dati possibili relativi ai vari allenamenti e forse per questo avrei dovuto prendere un Forerunner o Fenix, ma avevo paura dell\'integrazione con l\'iPhone che per me è molto importante (messaggi, notifiche, email, età.) Per questo la scelta è caduta sul modello Garmin che ritenevo più simile a Apple Watch per la parte smartwatch senza rinunciare a molto sulla parte sportwatch.Veniamo alla recensione.Inizio subito ad elencare le cose che mi piacciono molto del Venu 2:1) durata della batteria: niente a che vedere con AW. Anche se non arriva ai valori dichiarati la durata è comunque molto buona, ci faccio tranquillamente 4/5 giorni facendo almeno 1 ora di attività al giorno e con il pulsossimetro attivo tutta la notte. Molto rapida anche la ricarica.2) Estetica e comodità: a me piace molto la sua estetica ed è confortevole da indossare per tutto il giorno e durante la notte; non lo si sente neanche al polso.3) Molto utili i pulsanti per avviare/stoppare una attività: purtroppo con l\'Apple Watch mi è capitato varie volte che durante gli allenamenti di CrossFit l\'attività entrasse in pausa o si stoppasse o per via del sudore che cade sul display o per aver premuto inavvertitamente il pulsante laterale con il polso (costringendomi ad indossarlo sul polso destro per evitare questo problema). Tutto questo con Venu 2 non succede.4) Garmin Connect: molto ben fatto, consente di avere tutte insieme una serie di informazioni complete sulla attività fisica, sul sonno e molto altro ancora. Il body battery è forse l\'indicazione che mi è piaciuta di più e devo dire che l\'ho anche trovata molto accurata. Quelle notti in cui non ho dormito bene il livello non si è caricato moltissimo, e devo dire che il valore indicato riportava la mia sensazione sul mio stato fisico. Anche eventuali pause giornaliere servono ad aumentare il valore del boss battery. Molto utile anche l\'indicazioni delle zone di lavoro cardiache per ogni attività.Passiamo a cosa non mi ha convinto molto:1) accuratezza lettore pulsazioni cardiache: fino a quando non ho giocato a tennis ho pensato che l\'accuratezza fosse a livello del sensore di AW, da tutti riconosciuto come il più veritiero. Infatti anche negli allenamenti di CrossFit che sono difficili da monitorare per via dei continui picchi e per l\'utilizzo che si fa del polso, ho sempre riscontrato dei valori assolutamente plausibili ed in linea con le misurazioni fatte con AW (mentre devo dire che il Polar Verity Sense che ho restituito in moltissimi frangenti non riusciva a misurare nessuna pulsazione). Sono rimasto soddisfatto anche delle misurazioni durante la corsa e nel padel. Non capisco come, con queste premesse, la misurazione durante un leggerissimo allenamento di tennis siano state completamente sballate (preciso che ho usato la funzione cardio non essendo il tennis presente tra gli sport monitorati). Anche se ho tenuto il Venu 2 sul braccio in cui non tengo la racchetta (e quindi non soggetto a sollecitazioni e vibrazioni) le pulsazioni sono sempre state esagerate, addirittura dopo un semplice palleggio è arrivato a segnarmi 172 pulsazioni al minuto (quando misurate manualmente erano sotto le 90). La misurazione non è mai scesa sotto le 150 pulsazioni. Evidentemente il tennis ha qualcosa di particolare perché lo stesso problema l\'ho riscontrato anche con il Polar Verity Sense, mentre l\'Apple Watch è stato l\'unico a darmi delle misurazioni a mio parere corrette (per un allenamento similare il range era tra 80 e 125 pulsazioni). A riposo le misurazioni in continua appaiono corrette. E\' stato solo il tennis a creare problemi.2) rilevazione attività: non pretendo di avere il rilevamento automatico delle attività come in AW, ma è abbastanza curioso che durante una passeggiata in bicicletta, dopo oltre un\'ora che pedalavo, anche se a ritmo blando, mi sia arrivata la segnalazione ""è l\'ora di alzarsi e fare un po\' di moto"" come se fino a quel momento fossi stato seduto sul divano o alla scrivania a lavorare. Va bene che in bici non fai oscillare il braccio con l\'orologio, ma mi sembra veramente eccessivo.3) possibilità di personalizzazione: i dati presenti nell\'orologio sono molti e ben rappresentati, intuitivi da leggere e sufficientemente affidabili (vedi considerazioni precedenti). Il fatto è che esistono veramente poche possibilità di personalizzazione. Non si può scaricare quasi niente di veramente utile dal ConnectIQ (per esempio mi sarebbe piaciuto avere un qualcosa di specifico per il tennis/padel in cui riporta velocità del braccio, tipi di colpi tirati etc, come accadeva con AW).Cosa non mi è piaciuto per niente:1) watch faces: quelle di serie le ho trovate a dir poco imbarazzanti. Per fortuna tramite ConnectIQ se ne possono scegliere altre (poche a dire il vero) per migliorare l\'aspetto del vostro Watch. Mi sarei aspettato qualcosa di più.2) integrazione con iPhone: faccio un uso intenso del mio iPhone e speravo nel poter avere maggiori funzionalità riportate nel Venu 2. Una cosa che mi ha lasciato molto perplesso è che se orologio e telefono non sono molto vicini (cosa che può capitare se lasci il cellulare sotto carica) non sono assolutamente connessi tra di loro (pur avendo impostato la stessa rete wi-fi su entrambi). Ero abituato con AW ad avere collegamento con il cellulare anche uscendo di casa (bastava essere sotto copertura wi-fi). Così facendo sono sempre costretto a lasciare la suoneria attiva sul telefono perché se lo lascio in carica e vado in un\'altra stanza, se arriva una telefonata l\'orologio non vibra assolutamente, con il rischio di perdere la chiamata. Mi manca anche la possibilità di rispondere con messaggi brevi agli sms e a whatsapp (so che è una limitazione imposta da Apple, ma a me manca lo stesso); con il Venu 2 sono costretto a tirare sempre fuori il telefono, sbloccarlo e rispondere al messaggio. Mi manca anche la possibilità di sbloccare il cellulare con la mascherina ed il FaceId senza dover digitare il codice (ovvio che Garmin non c\'entra niente).3) durante i workout non arriva nessuna segnalazione: per me è importante ricevere segnalazioni (email, messaggi, etc) quando sto facendo attività. Un rapido sguardo e posso decidere se sono importanti oppure no e continuare il mio esercizio. Con il Venu 2 tutto questo non si può fare.Considerazioni finali:e qui veniamo alla spiegazione del titolo: vale la spesa? La mia opinione è che il Venu 2 sia un qualcosa di ibrido tra smartwatch e sportwatch che cerca di strizzare l\'occhio ad una vasta platea, senza però riuscire a convincere nessuno. Se ho esigenze specifiche (esempio triatlon) sicuramente ci sono sportwatch più completi (come Forerunner per restare in casa Garmin), se invece ho bisogno di uno smartwatch trovo che non sia assolutamente a livello di Apple Watch che continua ad essere una scelta migliore in questo specifico ambito. Penso anche che 360€ per questo orologio siano troppi, soprattutto se confrontati con i 309€ di un AW SE o anche i 439 di AW ultima serie. E\' vero che per avere gli stessi dati che il Venu 2 mi fornisce per l\'attività fisica ho bisogno di installare delle applicazioni aggiuntive sull\'AW (alcune anche a pagamento, anche se si tratta di pochi euro), ma è altrettanto vero che sul dispositivo Apple la possibilità di installare nuove funzioni è limitata solo dalla fantasia degli sviluppatori.Resta il discorso della durata della batteria, neanche paragonabile.Per tutto quanto sopra descritto non ho ancora deciso se tenere il Venu 2 oppure tornare ad Apple Watch. Aggiornerò questa lunga recensione quando avrò deciso.', ""I am really pleased with this. The SQ is a good mix between a smart-watch and fitness tracker. I am keen cyclist, so most of my data is downloaded from my bike GPS computer via the Garmin app. I use the SQ to track my commute and walks- so all the data comes together in the Garmin app. Battery life is great- about 7 days with 10 commute bike trips and 5 walks with GPS. Starting the GPS is a breeze, and the signal is found quickly. Occasionally the emergency contact feature has gone off - think the sensitivity is too strong- but it is easy enough to cancel. There are some apps that make it a decent smart watch- linking to smart bulbs etc to able to turn the lights off at night with a swipe is good. Notifications come through with no issues from a Samsung phone. I can leave my phone pretty much on silent now. Heart rate data is accurate- compared to a Wahoo fitness tracker. Steps seem consistent- but I don't know how accurate- good to use as a relative measure day to day though. GPS tracking is accurate and simple. Like how functions can be started and stopped with buttons- especially on cold days when I am wearing gloves. Overall, very pleased. Good price- not too expensive it makes me terrified of wearing it on a bike, but has enough features to keep me entertained. Would recommend. Had for 2 months now, and no issues."", ""Ok I've owned a lot of smart watches: Apple Watch 44mm Nike Cellular, Huawei Watch 2, Fitbit Versa, Fitbit Versa 2, FitBit Sense, Galaxy Watch 2 42mm, Fossil Sport, Fossil Gen 5. Overall the best out of all of these was the Apple Watch for sure but it came with some drawbacks like battery life.Starting with my use case: I want a good fitness tracker, good battery life, a nice screen and notifications on my wrist. I don't care about apps on my watch as long as it vibrates when I get a message or call I'm happy.The Garmin Venu 2 is perfect. I've owned it for over a week and I've only just had to charge it. Honestly I don't know how it's able to do everything it does and have that amount of battery life. 10 days with normal use is insane!!It's been great at counting steps and mapping my walks so far (need to increase the exercise routines). I love that I can save the animated workouts to my watch as well.It's comfortable, light weight and does everything I need it to do.Biggest question: do I rate it higher than the Apple watch? Yes with a but. I don't think I ever took full advantage of the Apple watch. It was great but I just don't care about apps at all. The only thing the Apple watch had over this is a more distinct vibration on my wrist.If this was to break I would buy another one because it's so amazing. Garmin have really shocked me with this watch!!Just buy one it's brilliant."", 'Mein erstes Fazit nach einer Woche ist sehr gut. Die Venu SQ erfüllt genau die Dinge für die ich mir die Uhr gekauft habe. Dabei sollte man aber einige Dinge beachten und vorher wissen welche Ansprüche man selber hat.Da ich nie ein Uhrenträger war, habe ich mir nur für den Sport zunächst eine Forerunner 45 gekauft, mit der ich überraschend viel Spaß hatte. Da ich die Uhr dann gerne öfter getragen hätte, mir das Design und die Größe dafür aber nicht passend war, habe ich die Venu gekauft.Garmin App: Ich kann nicht viele Vergleichswerte liefern aber die Art und Weise wie Läufe und Aktivitäten getrackt werden überzeugt mich.Design: Die Venu SQ war die einzige Uhr mit der Standard Venu, welche mir nicht entweder zu groß (~45 mm) oder zu klein(~39 mm) war. Damit erfüllt die Uhr einen für mich entscheidenden Wunsch. letztendlich entscheidet die Größe und das Design ja darüber wie oft man die Uhr trägt, das wird bei allen Tests oft vergessen. Sollte man aber beachten.Display: Hier war ich aufgrund der Tests sehr skeptisch, da es viel Kritik gab. Dazu muss ich sagen ich habe keinen Vergleich zu besseren AMOLED Displays. Trotzdem, oder gerade wegen der negativen Kommentare , wurde ich positiv überrascht. Das Display ist gut, und vorallem reagiert es bisher top wenn ich nach oben oder unten wische. Auch die Größe ist für mich ausreichend.GPS: weicht manchmal leicht von den Ergebnissen der Forerunner ab, ist für mich als reiner Hobby Läufer aber irrelevant ( 30 Meter unterschied bei 7 km Läufen).Akku: In der ersten Woche (viel mit der Uhr rumgespielt und ausgetestet) kam ich 5 volle Tage mit der Uhr zurecht und hatte dann noch 20 Prozent. Dabei habe ich jeden Tag mindestens eine halbe Stunde das GPS zum Laufen genutzt.Fazit:Wer auf der Suche nach einer Alltagstauglichen Smartwatch ist, bei der der Fokus auf Tracking von Sport und Fitness liegt ist hier richtig. Die Uhr ist ein Allrounder wobei ich denke dass man von Spielereien wie Blutsauerstoff etc nicht zuviel erwarten sollte.', ""Bought for my son and used this watch for a while now.The main reason I bought this rather than a lesser brand such as amazfit (I alps recently bought the gtr 2e for myself which I really love) is the sports modes and data.Yes, a lot of smart watches/activity trackers track the activities, but talking about sporta data, garmin is still the best.My son is very active especially swimming, we'd like him to start thinking more of his training plan and using data to help him.The battery lasts about a week depending on usage, and it's quite comfortable wearing it.Happy son = happy parents"", 'After graduating from the trusty Forerunner 235, I was looking for something with a nicer interface, preferably touchscreen and greater accuracy on the GPS.After pricing a few higher end models, I decided to the give the Venu 2 a go, as it was new on the market and got very good reviews.Absolutely excellent so far in all regards. Notifications are perfect, touch screen is flawless, love the vibrant colours of the screen. I love how customiz-able it is - i.e. your selected colours, features etc.Accuracy on the GPS is excellent - I also have a Wahoo Elemnt Bolt for my bicycle, and they are virtually identical in their data analysis. Slight difference on the heart rate reading compared to my chest strap but not a major difference, still detects when I am increasing my effort.Only problem, if you could even call it that, was failure to connect with Zwift (as I was looking to use it as a HR monitor) but I could equally blame Zwift as much here.Worth every penny.', ""I'm not really a fitness user: more interested in getting wrist-based notifications and texts, and in pulse rate, than in step count. Which is fortunate, because I can spend the entire day walking in my garden, plant to plant and up and down the paths, and get a count about half what my Fitbit records.  Out walking, where I tend to step out with a long stride, the two more or less agree.  I'm reserving judgement on its value as a phone connectivity tool: the Fitbit is very iffy about synching, especially if I have WiFi and VPN running (which is usually); so far the Garmin has been reasonable, though it does sometimes do a frantic catch-up and tell me stuff which I know is at least two hours old (despite being beside the phone the whole time).Looks-wise, it's a bit 'meh': square and blocky.  But that's the price-point; and I'm not blowing a fortune to get something prettier unless I'm stone-cold certain it will deliver instant updates and an accurate step count.  So for now, I'll be a Garmin Girl."", 'Zuerst die positiven Dinge.Sehr gut und ausgesprochen genau funktioniert die GPS-Erfassung von Aktivitäten, bis auf Ausnahmen die Herzfrequernzmessung und Sauerstoffsättigung und Musikwiedergabe über Bluetooth-Kopfhöhrer ohne das Smartphone dabei zu haben. Der Akku hält bei meinem Nutzungsumfang i.d.R. 3 Tage, was im Vergleich zum Mittbewerb recht gut ist. Das Display ist klar und auch im Freien gut ablesbar und bisher hat die Smartwatch auch alle Wasseraktivitäten schadlos überstanden. Wenn man einmal die Logik hiter der Bedienung verstanden hat, funktioniert die Navigation über das Touchdiplay sehr zuverlässig.Nun zu dem, was die Smartwatch massiv entwertet, wenn nicht gar für einen Teil der Nutzer in weiten Teilen unbrauchbar macht.Obwohl Garmin das Gerät mit ""erweiterter Schlafanalyse (Advanced Sleep Monitoring = ASM)"" unter Mitverwendung des optischen Sensors bewirbt und dazu extra noch einen ""Sleepscore"" berechnet, ist es die schlechteste und ungenaueste Schlafmessung, die ich je bei einem Fitnessarmband oder Smartwatch erlebt habe. Da Garmin nicht in der Lage ist mehrere Schlafabschnitte am gleichen Tag zu erfassen, ist diese Smartwatch für Menschen wie mich, die im Schichtdienst und/oder Bereitschaftsdienst arbeiten, sich ihre Gesamtschlafzeit also stückweise erschlafen müssten absolut unbrauchbar!Das Witzige daran ist, das die Smartwatch während der unterschlagenen Schlafzeiten die sogenannte ""Body-Battery"" wieder hochzählt, sensorisch also sehrwohl in der Lage ist diese Schlafzeiten zu erfassen, man es aber in der Auswertesoftware schlicht nicht vorgesehen hat diese auszuwerten und den Fakt zu berücksichtigen, dass es eben nicht nur Menschen mit ""Bilderbuch-Schlafzeiten"" gibt. (siehe angehängte Bilder, rote Kästen sind eigene Anmerkungen zur Erklärung)Jedes mir bekannte Billig-Fitnessarmband ist inzwischen in der Lage, einen oder mehrere Kurzschlafzeiten über den Tag (z.B. einen Mittagschlaf) zu erfassen und auf die Gesamtschlafzeit anzurechnen. In den entsprechenden Apps wird das dann als ""Power-Nap"" oder ""Nickerchen"" ausgewiesen.Da ich nicht glauben konnte, dass ein führendes Unternehmen wie Garmin dazu nicht fähig sein sollte (gerade wo sie die Schlafanalyse so hochtrabend bewerben), wandte ich mich mit entsprechender Frage an den Support:""Guten Tag, leider musste ich nach dem Kauf feststellen, das das Gerät offenbar nicht in der Lage ist, mehrere Schlafabschnitte über die Nacht/Tag zu erkennen und auszuwerten. Ich hatte das Gerät insbesondere wegen der hochgelobten Schlafanalyse gekauft. Da selbst meine Vorgängergeräte, selbst billigster ""China-Marke"" in der Lage waren, mehrere Kurzschlafe zu erkennen und korrekt auszuwerten, finde ich es für eine Premium-Marke schon beschämend, das man eine solche Funktion nicht anbietet, obwohl man mit ""erweiterter Schlafanalyse"" wirbt. Es gibt viele Kunden, die, wie ich, aufgrund beruflicher Anforderungen (Bereitschaftsdienst) sehr unregelmäßige Schlafzeiten haben und ihre Schlafpensum aus mehrenen Kurz-Schläfchen ""zusammenstückeln"" müssen. In der Software, selbst einfacher Geräte wie einer Amazfit-Watch oder Mi-Band, werden diese dann als ""Nickerchen"" erfasst und auf die Gesamtschlafenszeit angerechnet. Sieht sich Garmin in der Lage, kurzfristig eine solche Standardfähigkeit in ihre Software zu integrieren? ""Sehr schnell erhielt ich folgende Antwort:""vielen Dank für Ihre Anfrage. Leider haben Sie Recht und das ist aktuell nicht möglich.Es kann nur eine Schlafphase erfasst und analysiert werden.Wir bedanken uns allerdings für Ihr Feedback und haben Ihr Anliegen als Verbesserungsvorschlag an die US-Entwickler und an die dortigen Produktverantwortlichen weitergeleitet, bitten jedoch um Verständnis dafür, dass wir nicht abschätzen können, ob entsprechende Änderungen implementiert werden und, falls ja, wann und in welcher Form. Natürlich sind wir aber der Meinung, dass das ein nützliches Feature ist und auf jeden Fall implementiert werden sollte.""Das war Mitte August, seither hat sich in der Richtung (erwartungsgemäß) nicht verändert und ich glaube auch kaum mehr daran. Der Kunde hat ja schon gekauft, da ist der Antrieb regelmäßig gering.Letzlich völlig nutzlos ist die Garmin-Pay Funktion, da (außer der Commerzbank) keine der großen Banken diesen Alleingang unterstützt. Lediglich eine Handvoll Fintechs wie VimPay, Revolut, Transferwise und sonstige hat man ins Boot bekommen, die wohl nur die Wenigsten in Deutschland kennen, geschweige denn nutzen.

I love all the functions it has from storing music to blue tooth connection so I get messages to my watch and I can send one line replies without going on my phone. I also like that it can track different activities from weightlifting to cardio to yoga, pilates and even swimming. It gives reminders when you are sedentary for too long. I haven't used the sleep tracker yet because I don't like to have any active devices on me while asleep. The battery lasts a good 4-5 days depending on what functions I use for example have bluetooth on constantly, listening to music etc.There a couple of things I'm bummed out about with the Garmin Venu SQ:1. I can't use my HSBC cards on Garmin Pay2. I'm not a huge fan of the strap as it feels a bit cheap. (Obviously you can find replacement or even other bands on Amazon that you can use with Venu SQ.All in all I am mostly satisfied with this smart watch. It would get a perfect score if I am able to pay using Garmin Pay."", ""Birthday gift from my partner and family.This is an amazing smart watch that has all the features of the flagship models from other vendors. I especially love the sleep tracking, it's very accurate.But it beats all the other vendors in one area.

Shouldn't have bothered.  The good points being the Garmin app is fantastic, it shows some serious data and all for free unlike fitbit.The problems I've had are, in 2 weeks of owning the watch, it's failed to save workouts twice, it's paused automatically mid run for no reason, it's also quit the activity mid run again for no reason, it's almost like the watch doesn't have enough memory then gives up.I'd avoid this one, I'm gonna try and return."", 'Bought this on a friend’s recommendation after using cheaper devices a few times and not being happy. This is a brilliant piece of kit, the app is easy to use, I find the recording very accurate and battery life is excellent. Works well with my iPhone, didn’t want to pay the price for an Apple Watch when this does everything I need it to. My one complaint, which lost it a star, is after having it for a few weeks I went to London at the weekend and was walking around for a large part of the day and when I took the watch off to shower I noticed it had rubbed the skin on part of my wrist. This may be my fault as I had the strap on a slightly looser setting as sometimes my hands swell a little in the heat when I’m walking so I did it a little looser to accommodate. It didn’t feel like it was loose enough to be rubbing but presume it must have been.', 'Da ich bereits von der Venu (1. Generation) hinsichtlich einer Akkulaufzeit von 6 Tagen recht angetan war, hier jedoch das Finden einer GPS-Position bis zu eine Minute lang gedauert hat, habe ich in die Venu 2s große Erwartungen gesteckt.Pro: Das Display und das gesamte neue Layout sind wirklich toll geraten. Das GPS wird schnell gefunden und das Tracking funktioniert sehr genau. Die oftmals geäußerte Kritik, dass die Menüführung sehr irreführend sei, kann ich nicht nachvollziehen.Kontra: Selbst bei Verwendung der von Garmin veröffentlichten Einstellungen, die angeblich eine Akkulaufzeit von bis zu 10 Tagen ermöglichten sollten, war bei mir der Akku bereits nach 4 Tagen erschöpft - dies sind sogar zwei Tage weniger, als die Venu der 1. Generation geliefert hat; auch ein mehrmaliges Zurücksetzen der Uhr brachte keine Verbesserung. Ein weiteres Manko ist, dass das in der Werbung so hoch gepriesene Anzeigen des Fitnessalters bei meiner Uhr nicht funktioniert hat - weder in der Garmin Connect App (hier erschien immer die Meldung ""es ist ein Fehler aufgetreten""), noch auf der Website von Garmin Connect.Da für mich die Akkulaufzeit von bis zu 10 Tagen (laut Garmin) ein schlagendes Argument für den Kauf war, die bei meinem Exemplar nicht einmal annähernd erreicht wurden, werde ich sie zurücksenden.', 'So far I\'m pretty impressed with this. I\'ve had a few ""fitness smart watches"" over the years now. I\'ve come from the Samsung active 2 which was dreadful for fitness tracking capabilities.

I would recommend this watch to anyone who is looking to track their active lifestyle.', ""Finally I find a sport health watch that does not require you to pay any extras maybe you will not be able to answer messages I make phone calls but I don't care I'm really very happy in the face of Fitbit Apple and Samsung"", 'Fab product.

Cycling with a Fitbit would generate steps to overall daily total…. Bike handle vibrations. This watch - nope - proper actual tracking!It does auto track a walk / cycle / run etc - but it doesn’t give you any further data like a Fitbit would- which is a shame.You therefore have to actually track / start the watch for the activity of you want to look into distance etc.As a runner - I’m working on my cadence - this is easily viewed now on my chosen running screen.Great for swimming too as I no longer have to count lengths - which would hurt my brain in every session 😬Lights in the dark - sometimes disturb me if my wrist and angle shows the watch trying to scan. Guess the round face makes it easier to see / for light to escape.So - Just a few couple of things I miss from the fitbit world - plus the step networks / challenges etc but I will learn to live without it and judge my own progress with the garmin and Strava app. Defo counts exercise calories far more accurately. Fitbit always over estimate!!Price fluctuates - paid 207£ - wouldn’t pay much more for it - but a £200 price tag for it is a fair deal!!I love my watch and feel like this is more negative than positive - but it shouldn’t be. Oh and one other down side - battery life - lasts 3’days max if using to track about 90min of exercise a day.', ""Absolutely love  this watch.  Bought to replace a fitbit blaze which no longer holds its charge.This was easy to set up, looks good and the price is even better.I had considered an Apple Watch SE but this does virtually the same things so why would I pay more for something that doesn't really do anything extra?Battery life is pretty good, haven't had the 6 days battery life - probably because I use it to track exercise every day.If you're considering this go for it, you'll be more than happy."", ""I primarily wanted a watch to use for golf, running and general health & activity tracking.I returned a Huawei GT2 watch due to issues I had with it's heart rate monitor and chose this as it's replacement.The Venu doesn't have the quality look and feel of the Huawei, but it is acceptable to me.It seems to either work as a metric or imperial measurement device which is inconvenient as I run and swim in metric and play golf in imperial.  I haven't yet found a way to set up as metric for run/swim and imperial for golf (that's not to say it isn't possibleThe golf function works fine, but defaults to metric yardage.  I am living with this, just add an extra 10% to the distance offered to get the yardage.Running is fine and I feel it does get distance, time and heartrate correct and it does offer a connection to a chest heartrate monitor if required.(which is another reason I chose this watch as my Huawei didn't offer this).The only thing missing is the ability to set up some of the training plans which are available on other Garmin watches.. but for me, as a lite user, something I can live withSwimming is OK, although often seems to have a length added or missing, but that could be down to the swimming that I do (I haven't yet tried all crawl)I don't use the music function, but do find the notification function useful.The screen is easy to read, even when out running, but I have had to increase the brightness to the middle setting.Battery life is OK for me, I usually charge it twice a week and use the GPS 3 times (1x golf and 2xrun) and it charges in a couple of hours.So I don't think the Venu 2 is perfect, but is a decent compromise that gives me most things I want in a single watch."", ""I'm a big Garmin fan.

How can it say you're fully charged if it can't measure how well you've sleptSearch the forums before purchasing, a lot of disgruntled buyers.

Its general functionality i.e. GPS, step count, notifications etc. is pretty decent but the fact it crashes so often is really annoying and I'm having to go the wringer with Garmin support to get any help. Also the blood oxygen readings are very inaccurate, often seeing mid 80s when my finger pulse device is showing 99-100 - as is my wife's Apple Watch -  so for me this renders that functionality completely unreliable. As others have noted the display even when sensitivity is set to high can be tricky and rather annoying to turn on. I have had several Garmin watches  in the past and this is my first bad experience and most expensive mistake to date. I wouldn't recommend."", ""I was debating whether to get a Withings Scanwatch or a Garmin Vivoactive 4 - I was looking mainly for a watch that could do spot SpO2 readings.As I was looking at the Garmin, the Venu caught my eye with its AMOLED screen.I find it very easy to read in daylight (unlike other smart watches I've had previously) and the ability to change watch faces makes it even easier.Integration with the Connect phone apps is excellent and the health data provided very useful. Readings seem to be accurate (enough for me at any rate) and the GPS tracks very well considering the size of the device.On that note, it's incredibly light and (as I have quite small wrists) not at all obtrusive.I haven't tried Garmin Pay yet, but downloading, listening and controlling music is easy enough and works well. I particular like the Hydration widget and hope for more customisation of that in future software updates.Battery life IS something to look out for if you use more battery draining features (brightness, live faces, screen timeout lengthening etc.). I tend to put mine on charge in the morning whilst in the bathroom and that tops it up enough for me so that I've never been below 50%.All in all, I've absolutely nothing to complain about with this watch and am delighted with the purchase."", ""I upgraded from a Vivosport and am not disappointed.  The screen is lovely and clear (for my aging eyes), the widgets are useful and provide more info than I was getting on the Vivosport.  I love that I can add more apps, widgets, music and watch faces.  With the watch faces there is so much choice allowing me to choose from data overload to more simplistic designs.  I have no issue with the battery life with the always on display as I do tend to charge my watch everyday whilst I am in the shower.

It does what it's supposed to sometimes and other times it seems to have a mind of its own. The touchscreen is terrible and the watch has a habit of deleting activities with out me even touching it mid cycle. Other times the watch will show a blue triangle and crash for no reason, this is extremely irritating as you can do a 30 to 60 mile cycle for example and want to upload it to strava and the watch has crashed and deletes the activity. I think if you can't afford a better smart watch and you are not too serious about fitness and using strava connectivity this watch maybe good for you. But if you can afford it go for a better smart watch as this one's pros are outweighed by its cons in my opinion. I loved it at first but now after nearly a year I am considering replacing it with a higher end smart watch as this one frustrates me greatly hence why I am reviewing it 10 months after purchase and I just want to vent about how annoying it is. Lol."", ""This is a good watch that is only let down by a few issues. It tracks steps and heart rate well and even does a decent job tracking kettlebell swings. After a little while though, it will only count to 30 and quit despite going to 50. The body battery is a gimmick, but fun. Watch faces are good. I had quite a few issues getting to sync I itially and while installing watch faces, but eventually figured out to only install one at a time. Sleep tracking is decent. The watch randomly connects and disconnects sometimes despite my phone being nearby. Notifications work well, I do miss my Samsung's rotating bezel as the touchscreen has mediocre response ability.

I love the Garmin apps, and the ""gamification"" of fitness, whereby it sets you goals and reminds you when you need to ""get moving"" (helpful when I\'m sitting for work all day), and will automatically adjust your goals (like steps in the day) based on how you\'re getting on.  From what I can tell it\'s accurate, and with only using the GPS for 45-60 minutes a day I think I\'m averaging about 5-6 days on a charge (although it\'s never been below 20%).  My only complaint is I find the screen isn\'t responsive sometimes. i.e. I turn my wrist, the time screen displays, and then I swipe up (or down) to get to a feature and nothing. It doesn\'t respond.  It\'s strange. I can\'t quite work out why.  Am I starting the swipe outside the ""screen zone"" and it doesn\'t recognise it? Too heavy? too soft?  Dunno!Would I recommend to a friend? Yes - it\'s decent value and you get all the Garmin apps etc.  Also ... with my version music can be stored on the phone, which means I don\'t need to take my phone with me if I want to exercise and listen to music - which is a feature I really like.', ""cannot connect to home wifi, therefore connecting to Spotify doesn't work.

Garmin needs to sort this out.

Prior to that I had both the Microsoft Band and Band 2, which I liked, before the Band 2 died.  Incidentally, I had to change the strap on the vivo, and so have done so on the Venu as well, in order to avoid the rash which seems common on those straps, but not on the MS Bands.  The Venu has many other functions over the Vivo, but the one that seems to be the most problematic is the Body Battery.  When I first got mine it read 42%, and went rapidly down to 5% during the course of an evening of table tennis and cycling.  And there it stayed for several days (I think 5 is the lowest it can go).  However, I was expecting that, as a few people on the Garmin forum had said that it took a while to kick in, and so it did.  After a week, it has started showing charge after a night's sleep, and is slowly reaching higher levels day by day.  How useful this figure will eventually turn out to be I don't know, but rest assured, it will start to work.  Overall, a nice, if quite pricey, watch.EDIT: May 5th 2021.  Have now had this watch for more than 6 months, and I am still happy with it.  I continue to find that the stress and body battery are better indicators of my sleep effectiveness than I expected.  I have heard some complaints about the HRM not being accurate.  All I can say is that it gives me the same readings as my Polar 10 strap under normal circumstances, like just walking around the house.  As soon as the weather improves a little, I shall be doing some strenuous cycling, and will be able to check it under pressure.  The only issue I have is with the strap.

For activity tracking Venu 2 is just the ticket. With GPS and a longer battery life than most comparable trackers, it has made obtaining metrics so much easier.

The bonus with this tracker is that it offers some smart watch features and looks nicer (to me) than other trackers I have considered. I did also consider other Garmin trackers with GPS for only activity metrics without smartwatch features and with hindsight they would have served just as well and at a considerably lower price. Just one niggle in that I cannot keep watch on 24/7 as the silicone strap starts to irritate after a while (probably the case with all watches so not peculiar to Garmin).

The face I have is quite busy so doesn\'t haver acres of unused space.Accuracy is good too, again this is a general watch, but copes will tracking your location and activity.Sleep, body battery, pulse ox tracking is also improved by the new sensor.The watch is quite light, I was surprised by this - a nod to the non-metal casing. You get used to it too.Only downside, the charging interface - I wish Garmin would develop a magnetic flat charging system. Of course, if you buy a Garmin compatible charging dock you can wave good by to the short cable and ""on-the-side"" charging position.', ""Only had this about three days but growing to love it. Initial impressions on playing with it out of the box after the ease of setup of fitbit was 'what have I done?' but that changed as I started to learn how to change it to suit what I wanted. It is a techy's dream of a watch with just about any setting or bit of info available if you delve deeply enough. The sync is a dream after years of clunky 'will it won't it ?'  fitbit experience. This watch just works and works well.I think it may not suit non techy users quite as well, at least initially. I very nearly put it back in the box to return - really glad i persisted though. The garmin way of doing things. settings, screens etc is a bit weird and non intuitive I think. the features are there - but not where you might expect. Having said that - wade in - it really is worth it.I love the always on feature and its way of presenting info generally is really clear and very user configurable.Just tried two walks - one planned and I turned on walk activity, one not.Ten minutes into the second walk my watch buzzed ' activity started message. Both walks were correctly logged with maps. The GPS tracking ties up with any other GPS device I have tried - apart from Fitbit that is. (Fitbit would log the track correctly but badly miscalculate the distances.).I find it comfortable. It logs sleep accurately as far as I can tell. turns off unwanted display during the night. (I'd wake up with my Fitbit Blaze filling the room with light - not so with this.)The only slight concern is that it crashed my Nexus Phone on the first  bike ride. All the data was there - but I needed to restart my phone. Hope this was a one off issue.

Es verdad, que me consto configurarlo y que a veces se desconecta del telefono, al principio hay que tener paciencia y también con la aplicación ya que es muy completa pero no va como deberia de ir, tarda bastante cuando te descargas algun extra para el reloj como las esferas ( por cierto hay cantidad de esferas para personalizarlas), la bateria correcta, si eres una persona que tampoco le da excesiva importancia como yo no tendras problema ya que puedes tenerlo 2 dias a tope, haciendo deporte con gps y musica una vez al dia o mas depende el uso claro, luego cargarlo tarda menos de 1 hora asi que para mi eso no es problema, por ultimo añadir en estos conceptos positivos su pantalla amoled que se ve genial la verdad, he visto otros relojes garmin y no tiene nada que ver, si eres una persona que le da importancia a una buena pantalla este será tu reloj, se me olvidó comentar que también tiene entranamientos personalizados y una especie de entrenador personal para ayudarte a cumplir tus objetivos.Tambien me gustaria recalcar un poco lo que no me gusta brevemente aunque he de decir que es mi primer reloj deportivo, pero bueno...

Solo quiero decir que como smartwatch es flojito, tiene utilidades basicas, pero creo que esto no empaña lo que es este reloj ya que garmin se caracteriza por deportividad y no por smartwatch, por eso este reloj cumple de sobra que con todas las funciones a parte es bonito y ligero ideal para llevarlo en tu dia a dia.', ""The screen is huge, which means it is very clear to read but I am a woman with a very small wrist and a prominent wrist bone.

My usual garmin is a fenix 5 but this lacks respiration tracking and spo2 which are necessary for me at night.I\'ve used this Venu SQ to record a few rides and walks over the last two weeks and have now ""lost"" two activities due to the touchscreen picking up a tap on the discard button on the screen when a damp sleeve hits it between stopping the activity and hitting save. There is no undo or recover deleted activity function.The battery life is also dyre, not as bad as my apple watch but 2-3days max usually closer to 2.', 'I’ve now had the Venu about 3 months, it’s easy to read and use generally. Inaccurate on sleep. My question is, why is it not made clear that connection to Garmin Express is essential to keep the GPS accurate? Things were going well until it recorded one run as being 10 MILES away from where it actually took place. I’ve had some other runs that had ‘gps drift ‘ of about 100metres or going up 3000m in one run!!!  It was only connecting to a garmin express (using cable to connect to PC) that these problems stopped. It should be made clear that it must be connected regularly to keep up to date. And why can’t these updates be done via the garmin app as most smart watches manage to do? Or some notification that an update is available and must be installed?? From ready various forums online other people have had same problem.', ""This watch is much better than I expected. I was concerned about the battery life, but I typically get about 10 days from a charge. I have 'always on' turned off, as well as GPS and auto detection of activities. If I turn on the GPS, for a walk, for example, then I find that it uses about 4% of the battery in an hour, which I think is pretty good. It's also light and comfortable to wear. My main criticism is that the alarm has only a weak vibration and no sound, but this probably won't bother most people."", 'I’ve owned many Garmin premium watches and I have to say that the Venu 2 is one of their most accurate, best all round watches. I just can’t get enough of it. Battery life is good, but the screen is the biggest selling point. Brand new watch received, in a sealed box. Highly recommended!', ""I used Fitbit Ionic for over two years. I had no problems it's working, it completely stopped working and had no choice but to buy a new one. I went for change and got this smart watch and let's say I regret buying it. I should have paid £50 more and stick with Fitbit. The app for checking run progress is very limited, has no functionality other then recoding time and distance.The sleep tracker is rubbish, it records the time when I am in my mobile as sleep. I records  9 hours of sleep for me. I have never slept for more than 6 hr. Fitbit Ionic was very accurate with recording sleep.I would suggest buy a Fitbit rather than this crap."", ""Superbe montre, très fonctionnelle, légère, avec un très bel écran, mais malheureusement, un gros point noir: l'autonomie.

I haven't encountered any real issues in the 3 - 4 weeks I've owned it for. The watch was easy to set up and the accompanying app provides an array of data that is both useful and easy to navigate.

I usually get about 7-8 days battery out of it, which consists of daily walk tracking, also daily workouts and hiking/mountain biking on the weekends. It constantly tracks heart rate and gives steps done too plus a lot of other things. The metrics given from Garmin Connect help you see how you are doing / compare anything, this is a great fitness watch.I would probably stick to the Garmin brand if I was to get a new watch, they definitely know what they are doing."", 'I got this for the body battery, having had a Fitbit before and wanted more info on HRV and rhr.

It also has an alarming oxygen sat monitor, if it was to be believed I should be in hospital! Often telling me I’m in the 80’s at night and I don’t have sleep or breathing issues!

In time I am expecting to use it when I have had a little more tuition .', 'Dies ist meine dritte Smartwatch und die erste für die ich eine Rezension schreibe, einfach weil ich begeistert von ihr bin.Ich war auf der Suche nach einer Smartwatch die vor allem sportliche Aktivitäten tracken soll aber auch einige Smartwatch-Funktionen mit sich bringt.Die Garmin Venu war ein Volltreffer.Die vorinstallierten Sportprofile sind sehr umfangreich und für mich mehr als ausreichend.Die GPS-Ortung weicht etwas von der mit Google Earth gemessenen Route ab. Bei einem mit Google gemessenen Lauf von 6,41 km hat die Garmin 6,56 km angezeigt. Bei einer Radtour von 52,3 km waren es bei der Garmin 54,1 km. Im Detail betrachtet sieht man bei der Streckenerfassung leichte Abweichungen von der tatsächlichen Route (Weg), wodurch diese Ungenauigkeit zustande kommen. Das war aber überwiegend in bewaldetem Terrain und ich muss sagen, die Garmin misst da um ein vielfaches genauer als beispielsweise ein ähnliches Produkt von Samsung. Zudem sind diese geringen Streckenunterschiede für mich wirklich vernachlässigbar.Toll finde ich auch die offline Musikfunktion über Spotify (nutze ich) oder alternativ Deezer. Vor allem beim Laufen fand ich es nicht so toll das doch recht große Handy mitzuschleppen um Musik zu hören. Bluetooth Kopfhörer und die Venu reichen jetzt aus. Mit der Verbindung hatte ich bisher keinerlei Probleme obwohl die Arme ja immer in Bewegung sind.Die Puls Messung ist erstaunlich genau im Ruhezustand. Der Vergleich zu einem Brustgurt ergab bei den meisten Messungen nur eine Abweichung von 1-2 Herzschlägen. In Bewegung und vorallem beim Mountainbiken, gab es größere Abweichungen zum Brustgurt. Ich denke das liegt an der Messmethode und weil beim Mountainbiken in unwegsamem Gelände, der Arm stärkeren ""Vibrationen""/Bewegungen/Stößen ausgesetzt ist.  Bei Fahrten auf der Straße oder beim Laufen lagen beide Messungen sehr nah beieinander.Zusätzlich misst die Uhr noch die Body Battery (praktisch wieviel Reserven der Körper noch hat), den Stresslevel, Schritte, Kalorien, der Schlaf wird getrackt (scheint mir sehr genau zu sein aber Achtung: kurze Nickerchen außerhalb der normalen Schlafenszeiten scheint die Uhr nicht zu erkennen), die Atmung, sowie den SPO2-Gehalt. Vermutlich kann sie noch mehr, aber mir reicht schon diese Anzahl an Daten weswegen ich nicht nachgeschaut hab ob noch mehr möglich ist :-)Der Akku hält ebenfalls sehr lange, zumindest für mein Empfinden und im Vergleich zu den beiden anderen Smartwatches die ich hatte. Bei 3-4 sportlichen Aktivitäten pro Woche mit GPS Ortung, Musik beim Laufen, Pulsmessung, SPO2 Messung während des Schlafens, Rumgespiele usw., lade ich die Uhr im Schnitt alle 3 Tage.Optisch macht sie meiner Meinung nach auch was her. Sie ist recht schlicht gehalten, die Qualität der Materialien und der Verarbeitung ist hervorragend und sie trägt sich wirklich sehr angenehm. Ich nehme sie nicht wirklich wahr. Einzig der Geruch des Armbandes direkt nach dem Auspacken war etwas unangenehm. Dieser ist aber nach wenigen Stunden verflogen.Garmin Pay zum kontaktlosen Bezahlen gibt es auch. Konnte ich bisher nur einmal testen, hat aber reibungslos geklappt.Benachrichtigungen (Mails, Nachrichten etc.) funktionieren ebenfalls. Hierfür muss aber das Handy in der Nähe sein und da ich sie nicht verwende sind sie ausgeschalten und ich kann nicht viel dazu sagen.Kleines Minus aber keinen Sternabzug wert wie ich finde, ist das Laden der Venu. Das Ladekabel ist zum einen sehr kurz und zum anderen hätte ich mir eine magnetische Ladestation (wie bei vielen anderen Anbietern) anstelle einer Steckerlösung gewünscht.Über die Langlebigkeit kann ich derzeit noch nichts sagen. Dafür habe ich die Venu noch nicht lange genug.Über die restlichen bisher gemachten Erfahrungen mit der Smartwatch, habe ich berichtet (vermutlich für manche zu ausführlich :-)) und hoffe ich konnte dem/der einen/ein oder anderen damit helfen.', 'This product is great when it comes to its features, however the battery life is terrible.It lasted around 10 days to begin with, and then when charged fully only lasted 1 day despite the claim of 5 days.Product was returned and a full refund was processed.', ""Love this smartwatch.

Though the sleep tracking isn't too accurate as it only relies on movement and heart rate - if I'm on my phone in bed late at night and not moving much, the watch records that as me being asleep.

However this watch has one fatal flaw - it can take up to 15 minutes to get a GPS fix if you are surrounded by tall buildings. There is a work around by using the Garmin Connect app but this adds another unnecessary factor.  Some days I just want to throw on running shoes and go without having to wait ages for a fix. This watch does not deserve a rating of 1 star because overall this watch is certainly packed with useful features, a good display and great battery life.  However I am giving a rating of 1 star because lack of a fast fix trumps everything else.', ""Have been thinking of getting a Smartwatch for some time and when I saw that this was Highly Recommended by Which I decided to purchase.

Customer Service said the only way to fix the problem was by one of their technicians accessing my desktop remotely.  I wasn’t keen on that and asked if there was another way, but was told ‘there’s no other way to fix it.  We cannot help you’ so I agreed to letting a technician help out.  I received a phone call a few minutes later from a technician who just read out the troubleshooting guide verbatim.

I sensori sono precisi nello stile Garmin della quale ho già acquistato diversi prodotti. Gli algoritmi di rilevamento un po' meno dato che, per esempio, una serie di movimenti importanti del polso, per esempio usando un martello, viene registrata come effettuazione di passi o ancora lo stare fermi a letto, se ricade all'interno della fascia impostata come periodo normale di sonno, è registrata come sonno leggero anche se si è completamente svegli (ma le fasi del sonno vero e proprio mi sembrano riportate correttamente così come l'ossimetria (rilevazione dell'ossigeno nel sangue). D'altro canto sono attività molto difficili da registrare con sensori al polso. La app Garmin Connect integra egregiamente  il Venu offrendo, per gli appassionati, moltissimi dati, grafici e statistiche nonché personalizzazione dei quadranti orologio e numerose app installabili (tramite la app Connect IQ). Il Venu è stato immesso sul mercato da poco per cui alcune imperfezioni software sono accettabili e saranno presto risolte. Inoltre offre a un prezzo accettabile funzioni che fino a qualche mese fa si trovavano solo sul top di gamma (molto più costoso) Fenix 5, mi pare. Per chi volesse risparmiare una cinquantina di euro, è bene sapere che il Venu è il fratello gemello del Garmin Vivoactive 4 dal quale si differenzia solamente per il tipo di schermo (amoled invece di led e con maggiore risoluzione), un unico diametro (43mm a fronte di 40 e 45mm del Vivoactive), del peso (46 gr a fronte di 50,5 gr) e della durata della batteria (inferiore sul Venu)."", 'Never had a bad product with Garmin. I bought it to replace a Fitbit. My wife loves it', ""Desideravo un Garmin da tanto tempo e finalmente me ne sono regalato uno.Inizialmente ho avuto difficoltà con i settaggi, infatti i dati che lo smartwatch registrava non venivano poi trasmessi all'applicazione, problema risolto resettando le impostazioni senza portare allo stato di fabbrica, ciò mi ha permesso di conservare le attività già svolte.Il rilevamento del battito cardiaco è pressoché perfetto.La misurazione dello stress è ugualmente affidabile, ho verificato che durante eventi particolarmente stressanti, tipo dentista, i livelli registrati hanno avuto un picco.La misurazione del sonno è buona, anche se non mi sembra perfetta.La funzione body battery sembra ben fatta, ma avendolo da poco si deve ancora tarare al meglio sui miei ritmi.Gli allenamenti con la funzione hiit sono molto comodi, si imposta facilmente l'intervallo di tempo di lavoro e quello di pausa, una vibrazione ci avverte quando dobbiamo faticare o riposarci, trovo molto comodo non dover guardare l'orologio ogni secondo.La funzione GPS pur non essendo perfetta è molto precisa.Nell'applicazione Garmin connect sono disponibili varie sfide, gli avversari sono sempre più o meno del nostro livello. Ad esempio sfida passi settimanali, km mensili, ore di allenamento...Il fatto di poter personalizzare il menù è molto comodo.La batteria dura 5-7 con tutti i sensori attivi, tranne quello della saturazione dell'ossigeno che tengo acceso solo durante la registrazione del sonno.Altra cosa bellissima è che se ad esempio vado a camminare o a correre e mi dimentico di avviare l'attività, lui la riconosce e dopo 1 minuto per la corsa e 10 per la camminata ti avvisa che sta registrando l'attività.

Vengo de un huawei watch con correa de cuero y deportiva por detrás que era un lujo y esta correa es insufrible, no resbala y si no te la quieres poner floja te acaba apretando mucho (tengo un brazo medio imagino, mido 1,83) Para un reloj tan caro me parece una pasada que le pongan una correa tan mala. Si quieres una similar a la de huawei watch, en la página de garmin te cuesta 60 euros.. El sistema táctil de la pantalla tiene mucho que mejorar, es frustrante querer editar las repeticiones o tocar ciertas opciones y tener que estar dándole varias veces hasta que te coja el toque. Igual pasa con algún desplazamiento sobre la pantalla. No es algo masivo pero es incómodo.Luego he notado que si le pones carátulas customizadas, cuando giras la muñeca tarda mucho más hasta que se enciende, debe ser porque no es algo optimizado y tiene que recuperar ciertos datos, al final para que no pase, le pongo las caratulas por defecto. Tengo que explorarlo más a ver si hay algo en este sentido. El sueño lo mide muy mal, al menos el inicio del sueño, el resto no lo sé, me va midiendo desde una o dos horas antes de que me vaya a dormir y todos los días le tengo que poner la hora más o menos real.Luego el sistema de crearte sesiones de entrenamiento tendría que mejorar mucho. Hay una lista grande de ejercicios para crearte las sesiones de entrenamiento, pero no vienen imágenes, es sólo lista de texto y no sabes que es cada ejercicio a la hora de configurarlo y vas a los básicos que ya sabes o tienes que ir buscando de que va cada uno.Las aplicaciones disponibles buenas en la tienda son muy muy pocas. Aqui podría hacer Garmin un mayor esfuerzo y no sólo poner aplicaciones malas que sube la gente sino ir construyendo aplicaciones útiles y optimizadas.La esfera es un poco pequeña para mi gusto, y este modelo en concreto (en azul) es un poco feo también desde mi punto de vista, probaré cambiándole la correa a ver si encuentro una de cuero deportiva como mi precioso huawei watch gt (que es muy bonito pero no tiene tantas opciones como este ).Por lo demás, y es por lo que le pongo 3 estrellas a pesar de ser tan caro y tener todas estas carencias, creo que es un gran reloj deportivo, seguramente el mejor que he tenido hasta ahora, con muchas posibilidades.Me gusta la posibilidad de crearte tus propias sesiones de entrenamiento en las que poco a poco puedo ir incrementando la dificultad/series/rep/pesos/tiempo, el pulsometro es el mejor que he tenido, me gusta que tienes un calendario donde puedes ir planificando, te puedes poner objetivos, una carrera futura, desafios, etc..También tiene el coach para carrera progresiva que empezaré a utilizar. Música con bluetooth. Lo de ver los ejercicios gráficamente cuando los vas a hacer, aunque tengo que explorarlo más, y algunas cosas más. El gps creo que también esta bien según he leído.En resumen, es un gran reloj deportivo pero tiene unas carencias muy grandes. Iré editando según el tiempo para ver si lo van mejorando con actualizaciones o bien te dejan abandonado con lo que has comprado, es mi primer garmin y no lo sé. En Huawei por ejemplo las actualizaciones eran constantes incluso años después.', 'als diese , schlecht abzulesen, die Stiegen werden nicht gezählt, da kann die Vovoactice 3 , die Billiger ist mehr als die  und dazu speichert die Uhr oft nicht mal alles ab ?Geht zurück und wird nicht empfohlen, dann lieber wieder die Vivoactive 4 , die etwas teurer ist aber ALLE Funktionen hat die ich möchte dazu ist die Uhr langsam beim Synchronisieren, und im Betrieb , beim Krafttraining zählt die Uhr falsch mit , dann richtig und dann wieder falsch .', ""Love this watch.

It does indeed track your health all day and reports reasonably accurately on things such as heart rate, steps and stair climbing.

Für mich war sie einfach DAS Gadget. Nachdem ich dann allerdings aus verschiedenen Gründen von Apple weg bin, hatte sich auch die Problematik Uhr neu dargestellt.Ich habe eine Uhr gesucht, die zum einen natürlich ein zuverlässiger und genauer Begleiter beim Sport sein sollte, inklusive Herzfrequenzmessung, dann sollte sie Schlaf etc. aufzeichnen! Natürlich war ich auch Benachrichtigungen gewohnt, auf die ich wenigstens kurze Antworten senden könnte und eine Musiksteuerung musste es sein! Das ganze bitte mit einer Akkulaufzeit, die nicht noch schlimmer als die der Apple Watch ist!Nach all diesen Kriterien blieb nicht mehr viel zur Auswahl! Da ich ein Huawei P30 pro nutze, war ich auch nicht so wirklich glücklich über Lösungen wie die Uhren von Samsung, die eben auch auf ein geschlossenes System setzen. Also kam ich auf meiner Recherche zu Garmin!Die venu wurde es dann wegen des AMOLED-Displays! Ansonsten denke ich, ist die Uhr weitestgehend identisch mit der vivoactive 4 oder 4s bis auf die Abmessungen!Nach nunmehr einem Monat kann ich die venu echt nur jedem empfehlen! Sport sowie Herzfrequenz und Schlaf zeichnet sie mehr als genau auf! Was die Schritte angeht, kann man sagen, dass die Apple Watch hier absolut ungenau ist!!! Ich laufe täglich sehr viel und habe einen Unterschied von bis zu 10000 Schritten am Tag, die ich jetzt weniger angezeigt bekomme! Natürlich habe ich hier mehrfach selbst mit- und nachgezählt,  das Ergebnis der venu stimmt! Ähnliches gilt auch für Sporteinheiten! Auch hier hat das Apfelmodell doch sehr grosszügig Kalorien gutgeschrieben! Für denjenigen, der sich an beidem orientiert oder vor allem auch orientieren muss, kann das eine totale Katastrophale sein!Die restlichen Funktionen tun das, was sie sollen...Nachrichten werden angezeigt, man kann sie beantworten über kurze, vorgefertigte Vorgaben, sie zeigt Wetter, Kalender und steuert Musik. Wer es einrichtet, kann auch mit der Uhr bezahlen.Die App, die eine zwingende Voraussetzung für die Verbindung ist, ist sehr informativ und man erfährt viel über seinen Körper!Ich nutze sie bisher zum Krafttraining,  Radfahren, Laufen und Schwimmen und bin in allen Bereichen zufrieden.Der Akku hält mindestens vier Tage durch, bei normaler Nutzung, also mit Sport, permanentem Tracking etc...Was den Preis angeht, ist sie sicherlich nicht günstig, aber für mich die beste Uhr, die ich je hatte!Positiv ist auch vor allem noch, dass die Uhr unglaublich leicht ist.Negativ kann man anmerken, dass ich bedingt durch das Silikon des Armbandes an den ersten Tagen leichte Hautreizungen in dem Bereich hatte. Aber da habe ich leicht Abhilfe mit einem Textil-Sportloop gefunden, die eh vom Handlich her praktischer sind!', 'Has all the features I need for tracking my walking, cycling and running. Easy to set up and use one I got the hang of it. Garmin co ect app works well and syncs with Strava easily.Fantastic value for £200.', 'I was really unhappy to see this Garmin smartwatch used, unsealed,  even with dirt on the bracelet and on the back of the watch.Sent it back and applied for a refund.Very very disappointed since I bought it for a gift that could not be offered at the right time.', 'The box was opened when arrived at door step.

Zu Anfang hat mich das Armband noch ein wenig genervt, muss aber auch dazu sagen das ich nicht der größte Uhrenträger bin, bzw. war.  Nach ca. einer Woche hatte ich mich dann schon gut dran gewöhnt und finde es super interessant das alle Daten in der App gespeichert werden und man sich alle Statistiken sehr übersichtlich anschauen kann.Aber nun mal im einzelnen zu den Funktionen, über die App Connect IQ, kann man die Watch sehr einfach erweitern, wie zum Beispiel mit einem Navi, neue DisplayDesigns, WetterApps und vieles mehr. In den einzelnen Apps steht dann auch immer für welche Watch die App kompatibel ist ( dazu einfach unten auf Kompatible Geräte klicken und eine List wird angezeigt).In der App Connect hat man dann alle Daten übersichtlich aufgetragen und da ich immer Bluetooth an habe wird auch immer gleich wenn ich die App öffne alles aktualisiert. Es werden sogar Sportarten automatisch erkannt, ich war echt erstaunt als ich mal Radfahren war ohne es auszuwählen usw. und nach der Tour habe ich dann gesehen das es direkt als Radfahren erkannt wurde und aufgezeichnet wurde. Auf dem Hauptbildschirm kann man dann auch jede Funktion wie Herzfrequenz usw. nochmal anklicken und bekommt da noch mehr Informationen, zum ganzen Tag und auch zu den vorherigen Wochen als Übersicht, auf den Button Hilfe bekommt man beim StressLevel zum Beispiel auch beschrieben wie sich dieser zusammensetzt und auch Tipps wann und wie man gegen den Stress vorgehen kann. Alle Daten wie Gewicht, Alter usw. werden zu Beginn abgefragt und dann gespeichert. Beim Schlaf finde ich Interessant das auch angezeigt wird wieviel Tiefschlaf man hatte usw.. Ganz unten sieht man dann die Durchschnittswerte vom Tag und der letzten Woche.  Über den Einstellungsreiter oben links kann man dann Aktivitäten, Trainings, Ausrüstung, Gruppen, Kontakte und vieles mehr einstellen.Unten hat man auch noch 5 Reiter wo man Challenges, Kalender, News und aktuelle Benachrichtigungen bekommt. Alles sehr übersichtlich und gut gemacht.Um die Watch als SmartWatch nutzen zu können muss man in denn Einstellungen die Apps frei geben von denen man Benachrichtigungen erhalten möchte.  Auch hier alles übersichtlich gestaltet und Whatsapp klappt wunderbar, hier kann man auch kurze vorgefertigte Antworten direkt mit der Uhr verschicken. Meine Frau weiß so immer wann ich im Auto sitze und keine Zeit habe und nur kurze Standard Antworten kommen.Auch Musik kann man über die Uhr abspielen, zum Beispiel Amazon Musik freigeben und über Smartphone starten, dann kann man Lieder vor und zurück machen und auch die Lautstärke anpassen.Die Herzfrequenz-Messung funktioniert aus meiner Sicht sehr gut, ich kenne es von meinen alten FitnessTrackern das sie immer schön eng anliegen sollten um gute Werte zu liefern, das mache ich hier auch und wie schon oben erwähnt habe ich mich nach ca. einer Woche gut dran gewöhnt. Die Werte kann man sofort ablesen und sieht sie sich auch ständig ändern wenn man nun in Bewegung ist. Außerdem hat man bei den Gesundheitsstatistiken noch Stress Body Batterie und Atemzüge pro Minute. Ich schaue mir das echt viel an und versuche auch so gekonnt den Stress sehr zu minimieren und merke auch gut wann ich nun im Stress bin oder nicht. Man lernt sich und seinen Körper so besser kennen und kann ich auch ein wenig besser steuern.Der Schrittzähler passt mit dem was mein S10 anzeigt schon gut überein, das immer alle Schritte richtig gezählt werden davon kann man nicht ausgehen, da bestimmt Bewegungen auch immer dazu führen können das es als Schritt gewertet wird. Ich hatte zum Beispiel bei einer 8 Stunden Autofahrt mit nur 2 kurzen Pausen ohne viel gelaufen zu sein, knapp 1200 Schritte auf der Uhr. Bei einem alten FitnessTracker hatte ich mal nach einer Motorradausfahrt knapp 20000 Schritte und habe danach auch keine Tracker mehr beim fahren getragen.Ansonsten hat man noch die Funktionen sich die Wetterdaten anzeigen zu lassen entweder schon auf dem Startbildschirm oder wenn man ein paar Seiten weiter wischt, dort hat man dann Temperatur, Luftfeuchtigkeit und auch die Windstärke sowie eine Wolke den den aktuellen Stand anzeigt, klickt man drauf kann man sich die Stündlichen Daten anschauen. Auch kann man die Kalendereinträge immer schnell abrufen, die Flüssigkeitszufuhr eintragen, und auch sonst vieles mehr. Ich glaube ich habe noch lange nicht alle Funktionen entdeckt und probiert.Die Verarbeitung finde ich sehr sauber und qualitativ, was ich aber auch nicht anders erwartet hätte. Die Armbänder können einfach getauscht werden und so man sie seinen Bedürfnissen und dem Outfit gut anpassen.Zum Display selbst kann ich sagen, das es in meiner jetzigen Einstellung immer an geht wenn ich das Handgelenk so kippe das man typisch auf die Uhr schauen möchte oder wenn ich 2-mal drauf tippe.Das Problem hier weswegen ich auch einen Stern abziehe und nicht genau verstehe warum das so ist, ist wenn ich eine Jacke anhabe und die Uhr unter dem Ärmel ist und ich nun draußen wo es hell ist auf die Uhr schauen möchte und das Handgelenk typisch bewege geht das Display oft nicht an.  Hab ich nur ein T-Shirt an oder die Uhr ist nicht unterm Ärmel funktioniert es wunderbar. Ganz merkwürdig.Kurz noch zur Akku-Laufzeit die hier neben der Musikfunktion schon von Einigen als nicht gut bewertet wurde, ich habe sie so wie jedes neue Gerät mit einem Akku erst einmal einen Tag voll laden lassen und dann immer in der jetzigen Einstellung gehabt und hatte nach 7 Tagen noch 19% Akku, ist nun WhatsApp usw. eingeschaltet und es kommen viele Nachrichten rein und die Uhr vibriert bei jeder Nachricht hält das Akku trotzdem locker 5 bis 6 Tage. Und wie gesagt habe ich sie durchgehen an, lege sie maximal eine Stunde am Tag ab.Zum Laden kann man noch sagen das sie super schnell auf 80% geladen ist und nach knapp über einer Stunde ist sie wieder voll.Da ich gerade viel sitze, erinnert mich dir Uhr auch immer ganz nett das ich mich mal wieder bewegen sollte im Studium und auch wenn das StessLevel lange hoch ist, sagt sie einem man sollte mal ein wenig drauf achten. Finde ich echt klasse gemacht.Wie gesagt bin ich sehr zufrieden und gebe hier gerne 4 Sterne eher muss man sagen 4,8 aber ich möchte auch keine 5 Sterne geben da man sonst nicht darauf aufmerksam macht das es doch aus meiner Sicht eine Sache gibt die man verbessern kann.Ich hoffe ich konnte Ihnen ein wenig weiterhelfen und bedanke mich fürs Lesen.', ""I purchased the Garmin Venu Sq for my wife and she loves it.

Igualmente la interfaz podría ser algo más atractiva, pero intuyo que Garmin hara updates interesantes en el futuro.

Me animé por la actualización para las llamadas, por los análisis de sueño que ahora se iban a incluir en la versión no premium de Fitbit y por la rebaja de más de 4000 pesos. Total, lo compré, la primera opinión es que es un smart watch bonito; repito sabía todo.Que muchas de las carátulas te cuestan. Cierto.Que mucha gente se quejó del botón. No me importó, y es muy cierto que tienes que desactivar la función de dejarlo apretado, de otra forma vas a iniciar lo que programaste porque se inicia a cada rato cuando presionas la muñeca..Que no se puede guardar música y que se requiere una cuenta premium de Spotify para que sirva. Cierto.Que su sistema operativo no es tan ágil como otros. Muy cierto.No me importó nada.Hasta que un día me levanto con la noticia que había recorrido mil pasos durante la noche, pensé que había sido una falla del sistema, hasta que empezó a pasar todas las noches.Empiezo la investigación, encuentro que más gente reporta lo mismo, que no hay una forma de borrar los pasos y la quema de calorías ficticia, ah, y que probablemente sucedería lo mismo mientras manejo.A ver, un reloj que te cuesta 9000 pesos, ni siquiera puede hacer esto bien. Tienen una aplicación frustrante, de verdad, y nunca pude hacer funcionar el asistente de google.Total, si buscas un reloj «diferente» que se vea bien, pero con el que batalles para las cosas más esenciales, no busques más. Este es para ti.', 'La verdad es que ha sido una auténtica decepción, adquirí uno para un familiar y otro para mí y al final he tenido que devolverlos. Paso a enumerar todos los problemas que he tenido:1. El botón háptico a veces no funciona.2. A veces no recibes las notificaciones y si las recibes correctamente se van almacenando, pero llega un momento en el que se borran y ya no puedes responder ningún mensaje.3. Solo puedes responder a los mensajes, pero no puedes enviar ningún mensaje sin que previamente no te hayan enviado uno.4. Hay momentos en los que falla buscar el móvil, y cuando lo busca y suena el teléfono, permanece apagado, por lo que a veces tienes el móvil delante y aunque suene no lo ves. Para que pare de sonar tienes que darle a ""parar"" en la pantalla, no sirve poner la mano para que cese la búsqueda.5. No puedes acceder a ciertas apps de mensajería, solo las prefijadas por fitbit, por lo que es una restricción bastante importante para aquellos que usamos varias aplicaciones de mensajería.6. Fitbit te dice que puedes responder llamadas con este smartwatch, pero no es así, solo puedes descolgar, pero no puedes usar el micrófono del smartwatch para hablar, lo que hace esta característica es ponerte el móvil en función manos libres, que si lo tienes guardado en algún lugar cerrado, tampoco te escucharán.7. Alexa es muy restrictiva en este dispositivo, no puedes enviar un mensaje o llamar, solo sirve para hacerle preguntas del tiempo o quién es el presidente del gobierno.8. Muchas aplicaciones están en inglés, como la meditación guiada, que no es que no me defienda con el inglés, pero fitbit debería haberse tomado cierto interés con los idiomas.9. Y ya por último decir que de momento no trae el asistente de Google ni la función electrocardiograma que dicen que integra, lo implementarán más adelante, pero a día de hoy no están disponibles.Lo único bueno de este smartwatch es la duración de batería que dicen que tiene (unos 6 días), el diseño y su calidad, que con su acabado con bordes en metal y el cristal gorilla glass lo convierten en un wearable bastante elegante.', ""Fitibit sense dovrebbe fare un sacco di cose, promesse nella pubblicità e nelle caratteristiche riportate, ma....non le fa.E' uno sport watch, assolutamente non smart. Infatti, acquistandolo a prezzo pieno, si ottiene un orologio ricco di aspettative che nel pratico, non sono eseguibili. Prima fra tutte, l'ecg non ancora abilitato. Poi abbiamo google non ancora presente. La messaggistica è pessima, dato che non appena si riceve una notifica, questa sparisce appena la leggiamo senza restare in archivio. Non c'è ancora modo di immagazzinare musica per ascoltare solo con smartwatch, ma si deve utilizzare spotify oppure un altro programma a pagamento.Il gps con me non ha mai funzionato.C'è un parco app che non è ancora disponibile, e non capisco come abbiano potuto mettere il prodotto sul mercato se ancora non è attivo in tutte le sue sfacettature.Una cosa che mi ha motlo infastidito sono i grafici della app, incompresibili. Ossigenazione e temperatura si calcolano solo di notte e non si riesce  aleggerne i valori reali, ma solo percentuali assolutamente ignote.I passi sono soprastimati, poichè in mezza giornata raggiungi diecimila passi anche stando fermo e muovendo solo le braccia.Le attività sportive bloccano qualsiasi utilizzo dell'orologio, perciò non si può nemmeno uscire dalla schermata per cambiar musica o fare altro.Ci sono troppe cose che ancora non vanno e per il prezzo, direi che non ne vale ancora la pena. Bocciatissimo."", ""It took me 2 weeks to decide whether to buy the Sense or not. I read uncountable reviews and was very hesitant. Since I own a smartwatch but wanted a really good health tracker in addition I thought I just chance it and try the Sense 4 weeks ago,At first I had problems setting it up. It just wouldn't connect to my phone. I tried for hrs and googled. After midnight I found out that I cannot have 2 watches paired with my phone. So there was nothing wrong wit the Fitbit Sense, I just had to unpair the other watch, I then reset the Sense (long press and hold of the button/indent for more than 10 secs) and voila, it worked a treat. In the meantime I had already started return of the item and printed all documents ;-)After 4 weeks I have now cancelled the return because I am 100% happy with my purchase.If you are a serious runner, you wouldn't go for a Fitbit anyway,right? You might go for Garmin or Polar. The Sense is ideal for those you want to track steps, sleep, HR, ECG and so much more. The SpO2 will only be measured during the night so you can see the value next morning. This is important for me because I have slight sleep apnoea and I like to know if it goes below 90%.Yes, in order to see the SpO2 you need to choose a certain watch face, I don't see a problem with that. If you need SpO2 monitoring all day you can buy an SpO2 metre to clip on the index finger.When you use this special watch face you can tap on the screen and it switches from SpO2 to  HR, another tap to steps, next tap to active mins, another tap to floors ( the only one I switched off. I don't use it )I have no problems with the indent /button at the side. It is just a matter of getting used to it. I have NEVER experienced that by bending my hand I accidentally would have hit the button. That never happened.The HR is very accurate, I compared it with the HR my Samsung watch showed at the same time(not connected to phone)The sensors have been very reliable .Some complain about lagging. I have no problems with that. It is a new watch with new sensors , there will be updates soon and I am positive that this point will be addressed. I do believe it depends on the phone the Sense is connected to and the firmware version of the watch. I had an update 2 days after set up and my watch works perfectly fine.Battery life is amazing. with 3 x 30min jogs with GPS every week and many notifications from several apps and even accepting phone calls my Sense last about 4 1/2 days. The charging speed is outstanding, it'll blow you away. 10 mins from 4% to 25% keeps me going all day if I forget to charge in time. I don't have to charge over night and miss out on sleep tracking. I charge when I'm watching telli. The charger is a strong magnetic one that attaches easily to the watch and doesn't fall off.The wristband is like most others : the silicone-sweaty-sort-of-thing. This is one thing I don't like but I found an elastic fabric one on Amazon.com and I just love it. I am hyper sensitive to all rubber/silicone so the elastic one is brilliant for me.What I also don't like is that to some of the features in the app you have only access to with Fitbit subsciption. This is included in the purchase for 6 months. I will not renew it and will be happy to read the stats, after 6 months I'm sure I know what they tell me.So as you can see , I am happy with the Sense and am confident that with future updates it will be even more exiting. We should be a bit patient, everything new can have hickups. I only encountered one: after changing the watch face, suddenly there were no data on my watch screen, it showed the symbol for steps but no figure, yet in the app all steps were shown. A simple reset of the watch (press button for more than 10 secs, hold and wait for Fitbit sign to appear) solved the problem.At last: I live in Ireland and my Sense already has the ECG feature which works a treat. Some countries will get this feature with a next update, as I understand."", ""E' il quarto fitbit che acquisto , ma il sense e' veramente una delusione.Non c'e'l'ecg promesso, la misurazione della temperatura corporea non esiste , c'e' una misurazione della variazione della temperatura cutanea notturna che non serve a nulla se non si conosce la temperatura puntuale, la saturazione non funziona, il gps si aggancia dopo tre minuti quindi i report degli allenamenti sono sballati, la batteria non dura più di tre giorni e non sei giorni come promesso, infine ci sono difficolta' ad accendere alla schermata home, occorre scuoterlo più' volte. Il cinturino e'pessimo : ho lo stigmate sul braccio. Non vale 329 euro. Se non fanno gli aggiornamenti entro il16 ottobre lo restituisco ad Amazon. Sconsigliato!"", ""Ok so i have been a active user of Fitbit for many many years and this is myost favourite device yet! The battery life is very good and I think I maybe getting 3 to 4 days (can't be 100%) as one of the apps on the watch was in use without me knowing due to a short cut I created!😂 Changed now. The mobile app has NOT changed but has new additional information because of the additional info the Sense can collect. The accuracy seems the same as my versa except I seem to be sleeping better! Overall it's clean with a beautiful screen and doesn't appear any heavier on my wrist than my versa. The onboard gps is a great addition but don't add the walking exercise to the shortcuts as it will pick you up running round the house! A few tiny glitches but these will get sorted over time. There is no onboard music storage who h is a complete disappointment as I used to load up my versa and use it in the gym leavingyibile iny locker. But again, my most favourite Fitbit device yet."", ""So I got this delivered on lauch day (25th September) and have worn it every day and night since.I have had many fitbit trackers in the past and the last one was the Ionic. I gave up on the Ionic after a year because I had so many issues with it, the worst being it would loose connection with my phone for no reason and then I had to unpair, delete and re install time and time again.I have been using the Samsung galaxy watch active 2 since and it was an excellent smartwatch but its fitness tracking was not good mostly because of the calories burned during exercise which was so off.I was excited to see the Sense on the fitbit website before it launched and I decided to treat myself. I always buy from Amazon because their customer service and aftercare is excellent.Putting it simply I love this watch. It looks great, feels premium and the screen is bright and clear. I'm fully used to the haptic button and prefer it to an actual button as it means that the watch will be better protected from water.My only problem is that when doing strenuous exercise like spinning the heart rate sensor takes a while to register the high heart rate reached, sometimes my heart rate slows a bit before the watch catches up which meand I miss out on the top range readings of my heart rate. Also the watch seems to think my heart rate drops down into the 110 to 120 bpm after an intense interval but my heart rate is definitely still really high in between hard efforts so this does bother me.  My Ionic did this when I first got it but it seemed to improve over time so I'm hoping that the Sense does too. My guess is that it is something software related which can be fixed. Also when weight training the watch puts my heart rate at 110 to 120 bpm when I know that after doing squats for 6 solid minutes with a weights bar my heart rate is way higher, my Samsung puts my heart rate at 140 to 150 bpm for this. Walking seems accurate as does martial arts and kick boxing. Maybe fitbit could fix this with an update.All of the features of this watch are great and I love it. I'm looking forward to seeing what updates come in the future to improve things. I'm especially looking forward to being able to answer phone calls on the watch as this was a big feature I enjoyed with my Samsung. The new os is nice and the connection to the phone is way more stable but it did drop out once so far and I had to unpair, delete and re install then it worked. I think that fitbit might be working on stability now as it needs to be better to be able to take calls on the watch so I'm guessing that's why we don't have that function yet.All in all I'm happy despite the niggles. I find this watch exciting.Update!My sense had to be sent back to fitbit today as it was faulty.  I'm very happy with fitbit customer service so far as they are replacing my sense with very little effort to action this.Unfortunately though Amazon now don't replace faulty products after the 1st 30 days. They used to replace faulty products up to a year after purchase which is why I bought it from them. I will just buy from the manufacturer in the future now. I have to say the Amazon customer service lady was excellent,  not her fault that the procedure has changed. Just thought this might be an important point to make incase anyone else buys from Amazon because of the returns policy which has now changed."", ""This is my review of the Fitbit sense after wearing for 2 monthsPros: -battery lasts a long time and is quicker to charge than other models, the actual charger is much better as it works as a magnet to the device rather than the clip style Fitbit are most known to have- updated HR sensors, the ones on my old fitbits were very temperamental especially during sweaty workouts they would just cut off entirely at points, this watch does not have this issue, versa 3 also has the updated sensors.-looks very sleek compared with other models, other than it being a fitness tracker aesthetically speaking it is a nice watch.-fitness bands are much, much easier to switch between compared to other Fitbit models that use a pin type mechanism- screen display is clear, easy to read, options for always on mode so you don't have to manually turn on the display to view the time or your steps etc. The display feels a lot less clunky when swiping through your stats in comparison to previous watch models.-mobile app is useful and one of the reasons I'm loyal to the brand as it's very user friendly.-6months free premium in app subscription with purchase-google assistant and Amazon Alexa compatible-ability to take calls and read notifications and texts as they appear on your phone-sleep tracking much like on other models is useful and helps me aim to get more sleep each night, the daily sleep score is also a good indicator for improvementCons: - the price and the features you get Vs the versa 3 probably isn't worth an extra £100 in my opinion.-ECG feature seems quite gimmicky and I have only used it a couple times-stress sensoring features are not accurate in my opinion, I've had panic attacks wearing this watch and it has never alerted me of a raised hr as it's supposed to and my stress score has been good regardless of this so I would say this is either very buggy or just novelty.- just like all other official Fitbit straps I've experienced, I got a really bad rash. I highly recommend the adepoy third party brand of straps if you have this issue, steer clear of cavn (which was the most widely advertised straps when I initially went searching for a replacement) as they are made terribly and will snap inside your watch which is more than slightly alarmingOverall I am happy with my purchase but there is room for improvement and I definitely feel like the versa 3 would be just as good if you're not into the ECG features."", ""Received in early evening. By bedtime I had reactivated my old fitbit account and paired the Sense with my phone. Wore both my old tracker and Sense overnight to compare sleep tracking. By the morning I could not sync my phone and Sense, pairing had gone. Tried to set it up again, didn't work. Followed the on line help, no joy. After 2 long calls to fitbit support during which bluetooth was off and on, the sense was off and on, a factory reset for the sense, fitbit app uninstalled and reinstalled no success. Also installed fitbit app on a tablet and the same happened. Pairing disappeared and could not get it to work again. During this time I was asked to use the Sense button several times, it worked about 1 in 5 times. This should not happen with a £250 smartwatch so it was returned. Thanks to Amazon for their prompt service."", 'Looks and comfort great. Usability not so good! Once connected to phone, it diverts the notifications etc to watch,WHICH HAS NO NOTIFICATION SOUNDS. It was supposed to handle phone calls and have ECG capability,  but neither work. Its gestures and touch response were very poor and intermittent. I SENT IT BACK!!', ""I bought this as my first Fitbit was an Inspire 2, but the strap caused severe irritation and wasn't as fancy, it wasn't something I could proudly wear while on my weightloss journey. The strap in the Sense is the latest and most premium strap I've ever used, it uses a different mechanism of attaching to the wrist and is much softer.Regarding the watch, for the first day I found it not to be tracking my heart rate that much, I'm not sure if it was simply postional error on my wrist or that the watch needed to get used to being on my arm as I have tattoos. It now tracks my heartrate all the time, although some nights I've found it has said it didn't get a consistent read and therefore never gave the more accurate sleep reading which tells you amount of REM sleep amongst other factors.I find the watch is more accurate in measuring my steps, perhaps due to GPS, and additionally it tracks floor climbed which the Inspire 2 does not. It's much easier to track and start exerc than the Inspire and the Versa is probably similar, so if you don't need EDA or heart rhythm than it may be a better purchase. I decided to get the most premium watch Fitbit produced as I prefer the Fitbit app in terms of tracking moreso than the Samsung watch I've used before. It is very useful and the premium is worth it in my opinion.Battery life for me is 4 days with dim screen brightness and not being always on, and with using the sleep mode at night which stops the screen turning on as you move in bed. Overrall I highly recommend the watch, but if you don't need some features I'd say the Versa is good enough.Edit: Small movements like moving up a flight of stairs or slightly moving in bed cause the watch to not read my heart rate until I remove it and put it back on, therefore leading to inconsistent sleep data and a lot of hassle. For £300 this is incredibly inconvenient, therefore like a lot of reviewers I returned this watch. If it worked I would've kept it, and if it does work for you, keep it."", ""At first I was really pleased with my fit bit. It looks smart and it takes lots of measurements. However within a few weeks the flexible watch band came loose and the watch dropped off my wrist and landed on the floor face down.  The screen has smashed and cracked across. For a sports product I would have thought they would have made it more durable than this. Be warned there is no way of getting the screen repaired once it breaks unlike a phone or Apple watch. So you will have £300 of useless plastic. I am actually still paying for mine too. Also to say I got eczema from the band in my wrist which must contain latex or similar and really flared up my allergies. As a final point many of the good features such as ECG you have to pay a subscription for after a few months. Won't bother with a Fitbit again!"", 'Having had and used a Fitbit since the start, my last Fitbit Versa needed an upgrade....I reviewed many other smart watches from all makes, but, finally to stick with Fitbit and purchased the Fitbit Sense.....Big mistake...PROSLovely strap and fixes into place far more easier than any other Fitbit I had previouslyBigger screen and much clearer to readI liked the push to get it going...despite some reviews, I had no problems operating itGreat Apps and I loved the 6month free premium albeit draining of battery if had all onSO..... apart from that I have nothing else to recommend THE Fitbit SenseCONSBattery life shockingly very short...longer if you took off all the apps that monitor your exercise health and fitnessConstantly not synching, apps not workingAND FOR me the worst thing about it was, it was not registering the correct steps/miles ECT from my runs on Treadmill and/exercisesI did sought advice from Fitbit help/community forum, to no avail, I felt I was fobbed off regarding the accuracy of mile sand/steps ran was down to GPS....sorry, but I did not have any of these problems with my Versa, which i have had for 3yrs....It was after several times uninstalling and reinstalling the Sense and still not working as advertised that I reluctantly had to send back.At £245, I expected the Sense to be working as advertised and yes I know they did do an operating upgrade to sort out glitches, it was obviously not enough.I for one am very very disappointed in the Fitbit Sense because if it was working as well as advertised, I could have enjoyed using it as my upgrade fitness smart watch.I have now gone back to my trusty old Versa where, at least, my miles and steps are in synch along with everything else', ""Bit of history I've had fitbits for years now.. they've survived through, house renovations.. Crossfit and well even me getting run over!  Got the sense back in May, had it only 2 months and accidentally dropped it.... not from great height on to my kitchen floor the screen smashed.  Which amazed me because all my old ones (the last being the Versa 2) have been so robust.... I thought no worries I'm clumsy I'll get a screen... much to my despair they don't do replacement screens!!!!  a £300 watch and you can't repair it! I'm devastated.  It worked for about a week after but now wont even charge.The actual watch was good and I want another but I'm really worried it won't last me. Some of the apps aren't great but it's improving all the time.  I'll agree with a lot of the reviews about the strap... I have sensitive skin and had to replace it within a week.So I'm currently debating if to buy another and get a screen protector... (ironically I had one in the draw but thought it made the watch look ugly/bulky.. and all my others didn't need it so went without) or continue with my Versa 2.  I'm missing the GPS and the in-depth sleep functions etc. but just can't bring myself to shell out another £300 ... well £279 as they are at the moment.I even contacted Fitbit and I have to say they weren't overly hopeful at all and didn't really get that I was upset I couldn't get spares not the fact I couldn't claim on the warranty.. I knew that from the start I dropped it!"", ""This Sense would have been my 5th Fitbit watch however changing to the longer strap I noticed one of the easy release tabs was extremely stiff and I broke a nail on it. Eventually I was able to release the short strap and replace it with the longer one. Within FOUR days the easy release catch would not hold the strap and it fell off onto the couch. No fiddling would get it to hold the strap fitting.I am extremely disappointed with Amazon's customer service as they tried to fob me off to Fitbit rather than meet their legal requirements under Consumer legislation. They refused me a replacement and best I could achieve was a full refund.As a secondary example of amazon's terrible service to customers is the two additional straps I've ordered for the Sense are no longer required as amazon refused to replace the Fitbit, their solution is to demand over 50% of the purschase price of the straps to return them, the second one I have even received yet.Defintiely avoid this Fitbit Sense and purchase from amazon.I doubt they will publish this review because it is so damning of both Fitbit and Amazon!"", 'Had a few of these, first one would not connect (Ebay)., second had a faulty pixel (Amazon), so as headline, third time lucky.Bought for wife so she is really impressed, especially with Amazon doing the replacements / refunds.

Once you see it you can't unsee it. This is going back. Hugely disappointed because I wanted to love this fitbit. Googled and found others with the same issue. I expected better for the money."", ""I ummed and arred for a long time before buying this watch. In the end I decided that I didn't want a smart watch, I wanted a decent fitness watch that would give me all the stats I need to track my general health and fitness. And that's exactly what I got.The fitbit app is easily the best app I've used, it links with myfitnesspal to give me a real time calories in vs calories out (CICO) and the free trial of premium means I also have easily digestable articles and recipes to support my weight loss.I love that there are so many faces to choose from and you can design your own in a separate app. The EDA stress tracker with guided meditation is also excellent if you can take 2 minutes a day for some mindful breathing and meditation.Is it worth the extra £100 over the Versa 3? I'm still not sure. After a month I think I've used the ecg maybe 3 times and the skin temperature is useful only because I have a neurological condition that's affected by my body temperature and I'm hoping it will give me an early warning before flare ups. If I didn't have that I'd probably have gone for the Versa 3."", ""Love it. This is my second Fitbit and it has so many more features than the charge 2. Bought for the health monitoring as much as fitness and its great. Very comfortable and the big colour screen is easy to read. Still getting used to navigating my way around it but overall it's great.  The only downside is the battery life is pretty low If using always on display and some other features but otherwise it's really good."", ""Good looking fitness watch with lots of functions but it's let down by poor software and non existent product support.I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present and initially she had problems getting some of the functions to work and no stress management scores.

TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS Smartwatch Qualcomm SDW4100 and Mobvoi Dual Processor System Wear OS Smart Watch for Men Blood Oxygen IHB AFiB Detection Fatigue Assessment 3-45 Days Battery NFC Mic Speaker ,https://www.amazon.com.au/TicWatch-Smartwatch-Processor-Detection-Assessment/dp/B09GFHDC84,"[""This is my 3rd watch I've purchased from Mobvoi, and by far the best one I've owned.My previous watch (TicWatch E2) had a battery life that would last for a day, but I wouldn't want to push it past, and I never used the sleep tracking feature as I let it charge overnight.The difference in battery life between the E2 and the Pro 3 is chalk and cheese.I've been comfortably using the Pro 3 for multiple days at a time, with sleep tracking, heart rate monitoring, and all that jazz enabled 24/7, and I'm finding myself only needing to charge it for an hour or so every 48 hours. With a bit of settings, changing, it would very happily last 3 days.The new processor is far snappier and less laggy than in previous watches, and is a welcome change. The display is bright and vibrant, and the low power LCD-display on top is super cool, and reduces battery consumption *massively* in the 'Essential' mode.Notifications come through almost immediately from my phone to my watch, and I haven't had any connectivity dropouts at all, another welcome change from my E2.I have relatively small hands and wrists, and yet the Pro 3, with its massive battery, feels even slimmer than the E2, and it doesn't get in the way or appear unbalanced at all. Its screen has a relatively small bezel, and the metal trim feels nice to the touch.My only gripes are that it no longer comes with a cradle-style charger, and instead is more of a magnetic plug, and that the very lower area of the touchscreen seems slightly less sensitive than anywhere else.While this watch is priced in line with the 'premium' smartwatch market, it feels worth every cent.I wholeheartedly recommend this watch for anyone looking for a WearOS smartwatch!"", ""I have been using Ticwatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS since last week. This watch is a brilliant overall package which justifies the price tag. I wouldn't call it an affordable watch but it's worth every penny you spend for it.Feature rich watch with a nice 1.4inch oled display which is very good under direct sunlight. Unlike the Ticwatch E3, which I also own, this is equipped with an ambient light sensor which does the job very well. The secondary FSTN display is used as always on display. It comes with back light which helps in dark environments and there is an option to change the back light colour.Watch feels nice in hand not very bulky and very comfortable to wear. The silicone strap provided is very good quality. There is no visible gap between the watch body and the strap, which makes it look a lot better.Snapdragon 4100 is a beast. Coupled with 1 Gb ram the UI is buttery smooth. No lags or stutters as of now, everything works perfectly. Can't wait to test the Wear OS 3.0 which will be released sometime 2022.Fitness and sleep tracking works as advertised, thanks to the pre installed Tic health apps. You can access all the data from the Mobvoi mobile app or via Google fit. I found the data from the dedicated mobvoi app to be a bit more easy to understand. Heart rate and SpO2 monitoring works very well. I haven't tried any sports tracking yet, so can't comment on that.Speaker is loud enough and the microphone quality is good. Voice calls turned out to be good with no issues hearing me on the other side.The advertised battery life of 72 hours in smart mode is no joke. During the first week of my usage I was consistently getting 2-3 days of battery life with all the features turned on except GPS. Continuous Oxygen level and heat rate monitoring with sleep tracking didn't take a toll on the battery life.I'm really impressed with the performance of the watch, never experienced this kinda performance form a wear os watch. With the promised future wear os 3.0 update and great battery life, I would definelty recommend Ticwatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS."", 'This watch is fantastic. It is an small improvement on the previous Pro3 GPS in a few subtle ways but it makes for quite an enhanced user experience. Overall I love Mobvoi watches as they work well in my ecosystem and this one is the cream of the crop with WearOS and a very snappy processor which makes all the WearOS integration whip along nicely. Highlights for me are the new strap which works very well and I won\'t need to sort another after-market once to replace this as it is good. The buttons are more tactile and ""clicky"" than the PRO3 GPS. The screen is quite scratch resistant as I scraped the screen while caving on some rocks and it didn\'t even leave a mark! PS. I will be putting a screen protector on it now! The health apps all work really well and this watch has dropped into my Mobvoi app without fuss.I need to talk more about the battery life which is improved over the previous version Pro3 GPS. Be careful with the always listening for ""okay google"" feature as I notice this can drain the battery a fair bit quicker.Overall I am completely happy with this watch. For the money this is the best Wear OS you can get and I am going to enjoy using this watch as probably my best go to watch at the moment.', 'Design and Build :- it has got stylish design with an impressive looking black frame. The all black colour of the watch is just makes the watch look amazing. It has a light weight and comfortable strap which makes it wearable for as long as possible. It has got a good strong build but I would still recommend getting a watch screen protector to protect the screen from external hazards.Display:- it has got a crystal clear display with an amazing touch response. The resolution of watch is high that makes every function/ operation in the watch look clean and high quality.Features and OS :- Every aspect of wear OS and Mobvoi OS combined into one watch is surprisingly awesome. All the functions and operations in this watch work without any lags or interruptions. It has got a wide list of features for a smartwatch at this price point, the one that surprised me was it can monitor mental health along with physical health. It can do it by measuring your stress, mental fatigue, sleep and other aspects recorded by your physical health ( though I tried to build up stress to test this watch but I couldn’t 😁😂). The connectivity with my phone is seamless with no interruptions or lags and other connectivity features work good. Additionally, all the cool watch faces offered by Mobvoi are a boon.In terms of fitness tracking and physical health monitoring, it can monitor every sport or athletic activity I guess 😁( it has insane number of sport tracking modes, the list was huge ), it tracks your workout accurately and also give all your physical health statistics accurate to assist you in your workout or sporting activity. It even tracks swimming with all your Heath statistics ( that too accurately).BATTERY AND CHARGING:- The charging speed is amazingly fast but the problem is that the battery drains at a rapid speed during any workout tracking and activity that uses wifi/ internet.CONCLUSION:- here’s a watch that looks good , has all the features an advanced smartwatch can have, at a not so heavy price tag I definitely recommend it. Small flaws do exist but they will become invisible one you explore this watch and it’s features properly 💯💯💯.', ""I have a number of Mobvoi products partially due to the price/value view point and also due to their fantastic customer service. This is a review of the watch so I won't go into the customer service side of things so much but will focus on the features of the watch itself.One of the 1st things I noticed about the watch was how solid and well built it feels. It has a good weight to it, certainly not heavy but it feels solid. This will be down to the fact that this version is now Military 810G grade making it incredibly hard wearing. I own other smart watches and I am constantly worried that they may get damaged when bumped but this watch gives you a sense of confidence. I work in a busy industrial workshop and at the time of writing, have had no issues with scratches, damage or dust .Next you notice how the strap feels. It is a thick, textured silicone strap which has a better feel than all of the 3rd party straps that I have bought. This may sound funny and will be completely personal to my wrists, but the holes are perfectly spaced so that the watch is in the Goldey locks zone - not too tight and not too loose!Connecting to Android Wear was very simple and straight forward. I'm sure it is the same experience as any watch but the snappy processor made the process quick and simple.The battery life is incredible which is partially due to the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100 Platform and Mobvoi Dual Processor System and also the dual screen. The LCD screen has all of the information on that you need at a glance; date, time, steps and current battery level and is highly visible in all lighting situations. There is even a back light (which I think may be LED) which illuminates the screen at the tilt of your wrist. This version of the watch allows you to change the colour of the light which is a nice touch.I have tried a number of training apps including Adidas and Nike but I always default back to the Mobvoi TicExercise app as the layout is very concise and easy to read. It also uploads all of the data to the app where you can view the data from the heart rate monitor (VO2Max, heart rate & zone etc), your pace, map of route taken etc. I would compare the app and the data collected to be on par if not better than the Jabra Elite app. I'm very impressed with this.There are many different exercise modes to select from. So far I have only tried 3 and am not sure what the differences are between what data the app catches but I will check them out over the next few weeks.The GPS locks on almost instantly and is consistently accurate which is useful as I run the same route daily and this allows me to track my progress. I have had no issues with drop out. I'm keen to test out the new barometer feature but have yet to locate this feature. I'll ask customer services who never fail to impress me.I have taken the watch swimming once at this point without any issues. The watch still functions in the water.The TicWatch has built in NFC which allows you to pay for purchases using your watch and Google Pay. This is a very handy feature which works most of the time. I have had to take my phone out on a couple of occasions to make a purchase as it didn’t work with the watch. I get the feeling that this is more due to me not holding the watch at the terminal long enough, or the right angle and then I get flustered and then just get the phone out to pay.I would like to see smart watches which allows music to be uploaded to the watch without the need to bring your phone. I had very old Samsung watch which had this feature which makes me wonder why newer watches don't allow it especially as there is 8Gb of storage available. You can download and listen to playlists on the Spotify watch app which is a very handy feature. This means you don't have to bring your phone but I have a number of audio books etc which are not available on Spotify so I can't listen to these. Being able to upload them to my phone would be a handy feature.Any issues I have with the watch are more related to the Google Wear OS rather than the watch itself. What is very comforting to know is from what I understand, Mobvoi is only one of two brands which offer Android smart watches which are powerful enough to receive the newest version of Android Wear which is coming in 2022. These changes in the OS will apparently make further improvements to the already impressive performance and battery life.If you're like me and you do your research before making a purchase, you will be able to find many positive reviews on YouTube and websites. If you have any concerns about the fact that Mobvoi is maybe not as big a brand name compared to say Samsung or Garmin, be rest assured that the hardware, software and customer support are second to none. Then factor in the more competitive costing, I would personally not look past the TicWatch!"", ""Researched a few watches (Samsung, Fossil) before deciding on this. The biggest appeal was battery life and this delivered. Having battery last 3 days is what I would call reasonable(still room for improvement) for a smartwatch in 2021. Reading reports that other brands have at most 18hrs isn't something would bother with and so reason is why went with this.This doesn't have the latest version of WearOS, however don't know the difference (previously used Xiaomi Amazefit Bip) and find it performs snappy and reliable, but it is scheduled to get it in 2022 once Samsung/Google dodgey alliance ends.I took 1 star off however, as a situation happened when my phone died and had to revert to an old phone and during the last few days had accumalted good data (HR, sleep, steps etc). I wanted to sync this when installed the WearOS and Mobvobi apps however I couldn't simply disconnect and sync. I had to factory reset the watch for it to 'forget' the old phone which is simply stupid. Luckily had only used it a few weeks so my customization wasn't too different from newly stock, but for long-term users this isn't really ideal and don't know why it is needed considering it's tied to a Mobvobi account.But other than that, watch performs well."", ""I bought this watch as an upgrade over my Ticwatch E2 that I have used for the last couple of years. This watch is so fast and smooth in comparison to to my old watch, that new chip makes a huge difference. The general feel and quality of it is excellent, well put together with a definite premium feel that the E2 was lackingBattery life has been amazing! I charged the watch when I got it on Thursday afternoon and still had 25% charge left on Monday evening. Never got that sort of life out of my old watch.... Obviously, that LCD screen overlay has a lot to do with that but it also makes the watch so much better in our bright Aussie sun, easily readable when a regular screen would be overpowered by the bright light.I am not a real sporty person, so I can't rate all the fitness features that come with the watch, but I can say that the heart rate monitor seems fast and accurate and the step counter is Handy to have available all the time.Overall, this is certainly a smartwatch that I can comfortably recommend to anyone looking to make a purchase, and great value for money as well!"", ""As usual I found the packaging and unboxing to be great, nicely laid out and easy to set up.  The watch overall feels lighter yet bigger than the TicWatch pro 3 I had on previously.  The screen is really crisp and the operating system and Tic apps + play store apps seem to operate just that little smoother so assume that is the processing chip.  Battery power is improved, and I get 2-3 days easy before needing a charge and that with everything enabled.My only issue is the charger, due to the way it sits under the watch (see pictures) it doesn't rest flat and that plays with my OCD tendancies.  Its functional though and does not easily disconnect.  Overall I am happy with the purchase, and would buy again"", ""Slimmer and lighter than expected.Very nice and large AMOLED screen.Very quick and responsive, faster than any other watch I've had so far, came from the original galaxy watch.Has endless apps and watch faces to explore.Finally I have Google pay!Needs a few more quick options in the drop down menu and needs an app manager/switcher."", 'Got the Ticwatch Pro 3 Ultra GPS a week ago and I am loving it so far! Personally a big fan of the huge screen and long battery life. I find myself using the ticExcercise app most frequently, which helps me track calories burned, workout time and heart rates with lots of different excercise modes to choose from. The power saving time display screen is also one unique feature that I find really convenient. Overall a good purchase, very satisfied with it!', 'The media could not be loaded.', 'I’ve had this watch for over a week now and I couldn’t be happier.Great features and sleek looks at a price that is more than half the cost of other watches with similar features.']"

She wanted a watch where the time was instantly visible (rather than having to lift to view) and mainly wanted to see when text messages and calls came in. While plenty of smart watches have an 'always on' feature, she really likes the fact that this actually looks like a regular watch first and foremost.With time, as we get back into exercise more, I'd say she'll use the exercise features more often too.I got an ANCOOL white silicone strap as well, which goes nicely with the silver watch body, and which was actually better quality than the supplied Garmin strap (which cost heaps more if replacing)."", 'I actually wish I had never spent the money on this product. It is literally a $800 step counter and watch. It never stays connected to my iPhone, even if the phone is right next to me it constantly connects and disconnects. I don’t receive text message, messenger messages nothing.I’m so disappointed. I saved for this watch, so to not get what it was advertised as is so disheartening. It is not what I expected an expensive smart watch to be like.The only positive thing I like about the watch is the look of it.', ""Looks really good and excellent for notifications. Still trying to figure out the widgets a bit. Took a while to arrive (but that might be due to covid and overseas postage issues). Set up was quick and easy. Little bit large when exercising but it is really visible when you are outside in the sun for walks, hikes etc. Sometimes the watch doesn't activate when I lift my hand too.  I  wanted something that looked like a nice watch with the added benefits and it delivers, it looks really good and lots of people have asked me about it or complimented it."", 'We bought this watch a month back for my wife. She was looking for something that is not too sporty looking. Initially everything was fine and she was enjoying Garmin experience. But then connectivity issue started with Garmin Connect. She was using her iPhone 8+ to pair. Despite multiple attempts and troubleshooting, no luck with the Garmin App detecting the watch. All other Bluetooth  devices were working without an issue with her phone.We did a factory reset and paired with her phone (Samsung Galaxy S8). It worked fine for more than a week or so. And then the same connectivity issue happened again.This time we reinstalled the Garmin Connect App to resolve the issue and that seemed to resolve the connectivity issue.But with all this trouble & hassles, it left lot to be desired with Garmin experience.Finally we decided to return the product back. So first Garmin experience has not been all that exciting. Back to Fitbit for time being (at least it works seamlessly).', ""All the good reviews are right its a great little smart watch. only couple of thing I would like to add, and its more to do with Garmin app - the notifications customization is very limited either its 'All' or 'call and Text' nothing in between. I would love to pick and choose which notification i would like to receive on my watch. Now because I have 'all' its heavy on battery drain consumes battery much quicker as its buzzing all the time. :(."", ""Looks great but has a bit to go in terms of development. Touch screen sometimes doesn't react or is slow. Method to enter code for Garmin pay needs to be improved (too slow of a slide on the touch screen). Annoying that dials move when you tap other functions. I know it's meant to help keep out of the way of you seeing what's on screen, but it's unnecessary, as you'd still be able to see the display. I've found myself annoyed that the dials don't just stay in place when I want to check the analogue time. All in all, I only bought this for the Garmin pay function, so it does what it needs to but can't wait to see how much better this technology could get."", 'It had taken some time to leave the warehouse but once it had the delivery was swift. Purchased for my wife, very happy. The watch is a good size which helps with the analogue appearance, it does however still contain all the features you’d expect of a modern smart watch. Worth the wait time on deliver as 25% cheaper than Australian high street retailers.', ""- Love that the watch just looks like a normal watch till I double tap it (my settings)- Love the garmin pay (works like a dream, better than my phone!)- Love the phone notifications & the fact it shows phone calls!- Love that it connects to the phone app easily (I had 2 x fitbits before and it very frequently didn't sync or couldn't connect to Bluetooth of the phone)- Dislike how thick it is (it's quite chunky and heavy)- Dislike that it needs to charge every 3-4 days (I now do micro charges when I shower instead of a big charge)- Dislike that the watch hands keep going out of alignment (though a full reset helped to make it much less frequent - only happened once in the 3 weeks since the reset as opposed to 1-2 times a day before)"", 'I wanted an analogue smart watch but the original Garmin watches were too big for my very narrow wrist. I hesitated as I wanted a black one but there isn’t a black 3s. My suggestion would be to have more choice of colours in all the ranges. However I am happy with the navy blue/rose gold one. It is a little complicated to use I need to spend more time figuring out how to best use it to record all my activity. It is motivating to move more when you set goals.

It did look better and the Display was much brighter that my Amazfit, and I liked that it had a Sp02 monitor.  However, I was disappointed with this watch.  First of all, the display would just randomly fade in and out and sometimes the swiping action would not work....It took me 3 min one time to change the watch face.  And the watch faces are all made for round faces and look kind of funny on a square watch.  Also the Sp02 monitoring was not accurate....it was constantly giving me low readings.  I think the other measurements were fairly accurate, but I didn't keep the watch long enough to thoroughly test those out.  The other negative thing about this watch is that it was very difficult to navigate its options....not at all intuitive.

The coordinates and stealth mode can be useful sometimes, though. However, the watch band feels quite soft and jelly like. The watch itself doesn't feel as tough as a GShock but definitely a lot better than those delicate smart watches. I love the grayscale screen and the long battery life.

I\'m not sure if that\'s the same for all watches, but I end up using the cardio feature for all my training as it\'s not vital I know all my reps in each session.Also, the storm alert feature doesn\'t really seem to work on a day to day basis in the situations I\'m in. It will alert in a warm shower, when the heating is on in the car, or just in a warm car, anywhere where there is a change of temperature/air pressure, but in those cases that doesn\'t mean there\'s a storm coming.The app works really well with the watch.

Posseggo già un Vivoactive 3, per antonomasia lo smartwatch Garmin dalle dimensioni ""normali"" e adatto ai polsi più fini, ebbene anche questo Instinct Solar è di dimensioni contenute (si veda la foto della recensione).Inoltre è leggerissimo!Per quanto riguarda le funzionalità troviamo un sacco di cose: Altimetro, Barometro, Bussola, profili sport vari, rilevazione battito, rilevazione ossigeno nel sangue..notifiche, sveglie, orario alba e tramonto..insomma c\'è tutto.Una nota sullo schermo: grazie alla sua translucenza è molto visibile anche in condizioni di scarsa luce senza la necessità di attivare la retroilluminazione.È un vero ibrido tra smartwatch e normale orologio digitale e da escursione. Deve piacere, se cercate uno smartwatch puro rivolgetevi altrove.Menzione speciale per la ricarica solare, mantiene alla perfezione la durata della batteria in condizioni di utilizzo normale (no GPS, tracking attività etc)SoddisfattoAggiornamento del 13 luglio 2021: sono al mare da 3 giorni, giornate piene di sole passate tra la spiaggia e le vie di Gallipoli, in queste condizioni la batteria non solo non si scarica ma anzi aumenta la durata!

Do not buy it if you are a surfer.I was excited when Garmin announced they were releasing this watch but the excitement was short lived. It does not Even come close to accurately trackIng wave count, speed, or direction and the tide function does not work.While tracking surfing it will show you actually going backwards on parts of the wave (back out to sea) and after completing a wave it does not realize the wave has ended and takes from 30-60 seconds to realize that the ride has ended and for the speed to reset to zero. WORTHLESS GARBAGE.The tide function is two hours off from the actual tide in my area. That is when the tide function is displayed at all. It mostly just displays  “no tide data” or “phone connection required” and has to be reset at least six times per day. But what’s the point of resetting the tide data when the tide information is two hours inaccurate.This watch also will not fit over your wetsuit if you have a large wrist, so forget about using it in cold water (if it worked that is).So Garmin tried to get into the surf watch market but they obviously did no testing of the watch with actual surfers.I was also hoping to use the watch to track kite surfing / wind surfing / hydrofoiling but there’s no option for any of those activities.Expensive watch that doesn’t do what it is advertised to do.It says SURF right on the watch for chrissakes!!And they have the nerve to name the watches “Pipeline” and “Teahupoo”.Back to the drawing board Garmin.', 'Solar charging, barometer, GPS..... everything i have ever wanted in a watch! a great replacement for my old Casio Pro trek  PRG-80T & my Garmin foretrex 401 GPS.... its like haveing both these devices all in one with the garmin instinct solar!!!!  but with the added benefit of it being a smart watch & haveing the latest heart rate sensor built in... haveing something that can take excelent advantage of solar energy but also has a built in GPS & bread crumb map for waypoints is something iv been deraming of for about 16 years! the only downside i have for this watch is the build quality.... definitly well build but i do wish it wasent an all plastic desine and instead incorperated metal to give it that beffer, tank feel. not that thats rely needed tho :). im sure it will last a long time!  but only time will tell if it can last as long as my now very old casio prg-80t....  either way....  i couldnt be happier :).', ""My two year old Vivoactive  pete tong, so time for a new one. I'm one of those people who likes to wear the same watch for all my activities, so the rugged nature and solar capability are what attracted me to the Instinct.Button functionality follows the same principles of the Edge520, so easy for me to adjust to. I wera it 24x7 and hardly know it's there.The big change from the Vivo is the screen type. It is not a touch screen and not colour, so initially feels a bit retro.Now I am used to it what I do like is the amount of data on tap, linked with the Connect app. - it seems to work better with the app, better than the Vivo (3).Battery life is a big win - at least a week, depending on activity, up to two without use of GPS etc.  There is none of the unwanted 'light' at night - the Vivi lights up when you move. The instinct has a light button and clarity is great for that mid night check of the timeSo a great functional watch - not flash but defo worth the money and the solar is a benefit"", 'Tortuous menu system- even though I\'m a long term Garmin GPS user it too me quite a while to find my way around the Instinct options. On the plus side I\'ve found the HRM and GPS surprisingly accurate when compared to other much larger Garmin devices such as Edge and Montana (using HR chest strap) As it doesn\'t have a ""proper"" map presentation I can\'t see it being useful for pre-planned cycling navigation but it\'s just as good as the larger devices for recording rides! An excellent product for the price and virtually unnoticeable on my wrist.', ""I was watching price of this product for some time and finally decided to buy, when it went down. Most reviews seem to be great, so I wanted to check the watch myself and see if it suits my needs. I use Xiaomi Mi Band 6 since May and before that had Xiaomi Mi Band 2 for 4 years. I also have Samsung Fit 2 bought at the same time as Garmin Instinct Solar.Good.-It's very light and sits tight even on slim wrist.-GPS worked ok outdoors.-Heartbeat measurements were accurate.-Sun was charging the watch without any problem, it's not a gimmick, it actually works.-You can customise power saving mode and create your own modes. Switch on and off phone connection, so Bluetooth is not running all the time and draining battery.Bad.I used all 3 devices (Instinct Solar, Mi Band 6 and Fit 2) at the same time, to compare performance and accuracy.  Sadly, Garmin was disappointing at certain functions. It over count steps. For example, dressing will give you extra 120 steps, even it you don't do any step. Other two devices didn't add any steps.On first day of test, by the time, I got to breakfast, Garmin was showing 320 steps, while other two devices around 120. And at the end of the day, which I spent at home and in the garden:Garmin: 5793 steps and 4.2kmXiaomi: 5014 steps and  3.74kmSamsung: 4055 steps and 3kmI tested two Garmin devices, as I thought that first one might be faulty. I also updated software to newest version. Other Garmin device bought from John Lewis was over counting steps in the same way, so I was sure it's not a fault, it's just the way it's programmed.Real deal breaker was discovering, that Garmin Connect app only works when you are online. You don't have any cached data in the app from previous synchronisations and you can't synchronise the watch when you are offline. So App is really interface to upload data to Garmin website.  Considering it's outdoor watch, supposed to be used while on different adventures, possibly in the middle of nowhere, I'm shocked to discover you can't synchronise it with your phone when offline.  Also, I don't like the idea of sharing all my data with Garmin, they were already hacked in 2020. In case of Xiaomi MI Band 6 I use third party app that doesn't synchronise my data to any cloud and can work offline. And Samsung Fit 2 is synchronised to Samsung apps which allow you to upload data to cloud if you want, but you don't have to. You can keep everything locally on your phone.If I knew about Garmin Connect app being only online, I wouldn't bother buying the watch."", 'Prodotto troppo acerbo forse volevano fare concorrenza al Casio G Shock arrivato carico al 56% ci sono volute 7ore per portarlo al 100%, lento ad acquisire i satelliti doveva durare 22 giorni  invece solo 9 la ricarica solare fa ridire in una settimana in barca sempre al sole non ho guadagnato nenche un giorno!!!!!

Having taken the plunge with the Garmin Instinct Solar I couldn't be more happy with it because it's neat and stylish on the wrist and the battery normally lasts around 20 days between charges. It is so convenient and accurate I've just sold by clunky old Garmin Edge and use the Instinct all the time. It syncs automatically via bluetooth with my iPhone and uploads all the data to the Garmin Connect app which in turn uploads to my Strava account as well.To be fair, I don't leave the night sleep monitor on nor do I use the blood oxygen analysis - I mainly just use it to record distance, effort and heart-rate on cycle rides and walks. The GPS function is only active when I'm cycling or doing a new walk. I'm therefore only using about 20% of the watch's facilities but I also use it for telling the time! (There is a guy on YouTube who makes dozens of very concise and instructive videos on this specific watch so if you want to explore all the bells and whistles please check him out).This watch looks and feels cool and stylish without verging into Startrek transponder territory. I'm very pleased with this purchase."", 'At first absolutely amazing but after only a few months the charging cable became very temperamental.After charging it displayed 28 days of charge at 100% but died not 24 hours after, unsure weather this is due to a faulty watch or cable though.

Used for indoor exercise such as exercise bike etc also and heart rate measurement etc seems accurate.

This one has a longer strap and is very comfortable.', 'I bought this to replace the 920xt shown for a size comparison, it was starting to fail so I needed a replacement. I wanted to get something with as good a battery life as possible without breaking the bank and this seemed to fit the bill.I initially bought a black version, but the button labels were pretty much unreadable (dark grey on black!) – although this could just be my eyesight! Having swapped to the ""Flame Red"" (aka orange) the label colour is a far better contrast with the case colour (black on orange).While I like the small inset window, the face does seem to waste a lot of potential display space by having a large border round it which would be better used to enable the text/digits to be larger - this would help not only for people with failing eyesight, but for reading when on the move, it also does not seem as easy to read as the 920xt!I have owned several Garmin devices (310xt, 920xt, 520), I find the Instinct interface less intuitive and the owner’s manual (which has to be downloaded as a pdf) is not great, so resorted to YouTube to really start getting to grips with customising the screens etc. - this is still a work in progress though!I have not measured the battery life in the real world against the claimed spec, but also with the wrist based HRM I must wear it further up my arm than my old 920xt, so it is also harder to ensure it is not covered by my sleeve which will impair the solar charging...4 stars for the mobile app just because that is standard and unrelated to the Instinct Solar and while pairing it to the Instinct Solar was pretty pain free, I find it a bit clunky.5 stars for accuracy – I am comparing this with my other Garmin devices and especially the wrist-based HRM compared with a chest-strap, I was pleasantly surprised.4 stars for battery life only because I have not had the device long enough to make a judgement although with what I have done so far it seems to be good.Overall, I am happy and it does most of what I want, although it does not appear to work with the foot pod that I use when training or playing sport indoors, that is paired fine with the 920xt.', ""L'orologio è carino, leggero e intuitivo.

What came was a new watch as far as I'm concerned. It's well made and has every function available for everything you may want to monitor. Came with no instructions but common sense and You Tube  soon had me on my way. On first set up you need to choose all the excersise activities as once you have gone past that set up, you can't go back to add walking cycling running etc, and have to re-set the watch back to factory setting and start again I found out, so tick everything to add it to the list of activities first. Great easy phone app,with no probs connecting and it gives notifications from phone texts,calls,e-mail and even news items if required. I have used the cycling facility GPS and walking and both give an accurate measurement of distance. Heart monitor is accurate also as I tested it with my other device and they came out the same more or less give or take a beat. Great watch.

Sleep, 9hrs per night, I've never slept 9hrs in my life.  I'd expect this for a £30 tracker, not something £200+, solar charging doesn't seem to actually do anything. For the price paid this is a bitter pill to swallow, also no basic fitness stats such as VO2 max.  If I paid £50 for this watch it would still be too expensive"", ""Having wanting to treat myself to a smart watch with great features and battery life the Instinct Solar ticked all the boxes. It looks great, is rugged has great functionality and the extended battery life is a plus for me as I often work away all week so need to worry about an extra charging cable.I moved from a Fitbit as I was having issues with the GPS functionality and this seems to be up to the grade however I have had some issues from day 1 with it not synching my activities saying 'FileTransferError Timeout'. I raised this with Garmin and they suggested to try all the usual steps such as restarting watch, phone, disabling and re-enabling blue-tooth which after a while makes it synch but has recently gone for nearly 1 week before synching then all my activities came flooding in all at once also populating Strava! Restarting things all the time is not something I will put up with for long so hopefully this issue will resolve ASAP as I do really like all other aspects of this watch and would be sad to have to return it as a failure."", ""The second of these I'm sending back, looks great and the solar charging is good but that's where it endsSensors are inaccurate, step counter says i have done three times more steps than i have and says i have walked down 10 flights of stairs but only up two, how is that possible?. Altitude at my home is always different up to 60m out. At £360 I think this watch is a disappointment I thought Garmin was a name to trust."", 'This watch was exactly what I was looking for. I hated the short battery life on my Apple Watch 4. Hated it. I was used to solar watches for years that lasted ages (albeit those were not ""smart"" watches). Like the G-Shock Rangeman.This does a lot of what the apple watch does albeit with some compromises. Battery lasts for ages of course, bloody oxygen level, GPS, heart rate monitor and step counter. Everything I needed is here and it last about a month without having to charge it. The monochrome display will not be for everyone, but it\'s simple and full of functionality and I am really enjoying the iOS app too.If you like longer battery life and like the look of a more rugged watch then this is for you. It is nowhere near as big or as bulky looking as a G-Shock though, so no need to worry about that.', ""I was in two minds about whether I wanted to splash out on a new watch. I had a Fitbit Ionic, but I wanted something a bit more feature rich and the Garmin Instinct Solar fit the bill. I do not regret my purchase. While the Solar feature doesn't get much use in the UK due to our dismal weather, I'm confident it will be really useful to top up my battery when I can travel again to sunnier places. The watch itself is packed with features, such as stress tracking, body battery (eg how much energy the watch estimates you have left to spent), and sleep and sleep SpO2 are some of the features I love. I am also very keen on the fact that the watch can automatically detect exercise and number repetitions during resistance training, which isn't perfect but it's very good. The GPS is quick to connect, unlike my Ionic which could sometimes take minutes to get signal, and it's very accurate.

Battery life is excellent, especially if you don't pair the watch with your phone all the time. If you're familiar with Garmin menus, the watch is very easy to use. Having some features accessible through a 'long press' is very handy.I use the watch for casual 5k running, road cycling and off-grid bikepacking. It's very well-featured for these activities and it's a welcome improvement on a Forerunner 235 I used to have.

Pretty good price for the functionality and not too complicated to work out how to navigate the menu!!!Only one fairly minor fault so far is that the GPS seems to stop working when I go for very cold water swims (i.e. sub 10 degrees celcius) - it still records my heart rate, stroke rate and water temp just not how far I've swum - odd?!Fantastic watch other than that!"", 'The best outdoor watch there is.

Ihr wisst schon, mit allen Funktionen, die man als Herawachsender braucht, Kompass und Barometer und sowas ;-)Heute bin ich etwas älter und tracke gerne meine Herzfrequenz beim Sport. Die Schlichtheit der Uhr von damals, die Reduktion der Funktionen auf das Nötige in Kombination mit Widerstandsfähigkeit und Laufdauer habe ich seitdem vermisst. Ein erster Lichtblick war die erste Instinct, allerdings hatte die den damals schon alten HR- Sensor verbaut, mit dem ich durchschnittliche Erfahrungen gemacht hatte. So entschied ich mich für ein Forerunner 245 mit der neuen Hardware.Aber jetzt hat das Warten ein Ende: ich halte eine graue Instinct Solar in den Händen, und es kann gut sein, dass sie meinen Traum wahrwerden lässt.

To start off with the battery lasted around 25 days. This was after turning off functions that I did not need and that would use up the battery. The last month the battery has not been holding charge. When fully charged, the indicator shows 25 days. I have to now charge it after 4 days. I used one activity for about 45 minites using the GPS and one activity (indoor rowing) which does not use GPS. Not impressed. The app has connection problems with the watch downloading data. Apparently this occurs with ios. Customer support is hit and miss.', 'Had the watch for about a month now and love it. I have had lots of fitness style watches from other Garmins to Apple watches and others in between, this watch is better that all of them by some distance!Yes the monochrome screen and lack of true smart features will out some off, but for a sports tracker this watch is mustard!

It does exactly what I wanted it for and it can be set for a bike ride on the road or cross country. There are more widgets (functions) than I will ever use, but at least the options are there. Ive connected it to my work phone so it also shows weather, outside temperature and notifications of calls, emails and text messages. It takes a little getting used to, because there is so much it will do. Glad I went for the solar option as I had to remember to USB charge my old watch at least once a week. After a couple of rides (in sunny condirtions) its still showing 38 days battery life.', ""Excellent product, very pleased with my purchase. I've always had cheaper Garmins but saw this and done some homework on it and took the plunge and bought it. It's Excellent and exceeded all expectations. 5 stars 🌟"", ""Sicuramente non è certo l'orologio da indossare con l'abito elegante ma se gli avete dato uno sguardo è perché state cercando un orologio robusto con una buona autonomia e questo sicuramente fa al caso vostro vista la dotazione di sensori veramente completa e affidabile.Una carica completa mi ha consentito due settimane d'uso con il cardio e la rilevazione delle attività sempre attive, più qualche lettura saltuaria con il saturimetro a cui si aggiungono circa 18 ore di ciclismo (cardio+gps+sensore cadenza+notifiche sull'orologio) e circa 3 ore di nuoto (cardio+gps)Onestamente speravo che la ricarica solare potesse incidere in maniera maggiore sulla durata della batteria, ma in realtà come anche indicato nelle note della Garmin, la ricarica solare aiuta più che altro a mantenere intatta l'autonomia nei giorni di utilizzo in cui non si fa ricorso al gps o al saturimetro in quanto questi sensori sfruttano la batteria in maniera abbastanza intensa e portano comunque ad una diminuzione dell'autonomia anche se l'orologio è esposto in pieno sole.Forse meriterebbe una mezza stella in meno per il prezzo comunque abbastanza alto e per l'indicatore della durata della batteria troppo ottimista quando l'orologio è esposto al sole, ma complessivamente provenendo da un forerunner 235 che dovevo attaccare alla presa ogni due uscite in bici, sono abbastanza soddisfatto, l'orologio funziona bene, i sensori sono precisi e affidabili e la durata della batteria molto buona, in definitiva un buon acquisto"", 'Charged on the 31st August, and still has enough juice to see you tho! Well worth it to go for the solar version. Been loving all the features and apps for it. The fact that you can download courses from garmin to it is great for cycling and running. Amazing bit of kit.

I did the same walk a few times and each time the ascent value varied significantly. Garmin suggested cleaning the watch each time but I was wanting a tough watch, not a fragile one.I returned it. Everything else was good.', 'Die Uhr wäre toll, wenn sie denn funktionieren würde. Zwei Stück hatte ich insgesamt, weil schon die erste getauscht werden musste.Bei der ersten waren das Thermometer als auch das Barometer sowie der Akku defekt. Es wurde weder eine Temperatur noch die Anzahl der Stockwerke (hoch/herunter) angezeigt. Das auch der Akku defekt war, habe ich erst später bemerkt, als die Austauschuhr kam. Vorher zeigte die Anzeige nie mehr als 12 Tage Laufzeit, bei der neuen dann 24 Tage.Leider währte die Freude auch bei der zweiten Uhr nicht lange, denn wie schon bei der ersten hat der Stecker zum Laden einen Wackelkontakt. In Folge wurde der Akku einfach nicht geladen - ziemlich doof, wenn man sie dann wieder nutzen möchte und der Akku genauso leer ist wie vorher. Garmin hatte mir sogar ein neues Kabel gesendet, aber auch dieses war nicht wirklich perfekt. Man muss Uhr und Kabel in einer festen Position befestigen, damit sich diese während des Ladens nicht verändert.Die Daten, welche die Uhr generiert und dann in der App angezeigt werden, erschienen mir auch immer etwas zufällig generiert zu sein. Das Schlaftracking funktioniert definitiv nicht. Die Uhr bemerkt nicht einmal, wenn man nachts wach liegt, auf Toilette geht oder in die Küche, um sich ein Glas Wasser zu holen. Andernfalls hätte die angegebene Wachzeit viel länger sein müssen. Auch Nächte, in denen ich teils mal eine Stunde oder länger wach war, wurden nicht erfasst - auch wenn ich sogar das Licht der Uhr aktiviert hatte, um zu schauen wie spät es ist. Insofern halte ich es für recht fragwürdig, wie die Uhr z.B. REM-Phasen etc. berechnen möchte. Die Garmin-App ist natürlich toll - viele bunte und hübsch gestaltete Grafiken - nur wenn die einfach nicht stimmen, hilft auch das ansprechende Design nicht.Das Armband ist leider auch nicht optimal. Es muss ja recht fest anliegen, damit die Uhr einen guten Kontakt zur Haut hat - sonst funktionieren die Sensoren nicht richtig. Obwohl das Armband eigentlich genug Einstellungsmöglichkeiten hat, ist es bei mir immer zu fest oder zu locker und es ändert sich auch über den Tag. Und was überhaupt nicht geht ist, dass meine Haut darauf reagiert. Das fühlt sich für mich gar nicht gut an.Während der gesamten Zeit musste ich die Uhr drei mal auf Werkseinstellungen zurück setzen. Entweder weil sie nicht mehr reagiert hat, ein Firmwareupdate eingespielt wurde oder die Navigation bei Radfahren abgestützt ist. Danach musste ich sämtliche Einstellungen von vorne durchführen. Das nervt maximal und hebt den Stresslevel (den die Uhr praktischerweise gleich auch berechnet).Seit gestern funktionieren nun 4 Tasten nicht mehr. Dazu muss man wissen, dass jede der 5 Tasten doppelt belegt ist. Ein kurzes Antippen öffnet je nach Taste Funktion X, ein langes Antippen dann Funktion Y. Bei allen Tasten ging bei kurzem Antippen nur noch das Licht des Displays an. Damit fehlten auf einmal sämtliche Funktionen zum Blättern durch die Widgets oder zum Starten von Aktivitäten.Fazit: Die Uhr wäre eigentlich klasse, wenn sie denn funktionieren würde. Offenbar hat Garmin jedoch neben Problemen bei der Software inkl. Qualitätskontrolle auch keine zuverlässige Fertigung des Produkts zu bieten. Ansonsten kann ich mir nicht erklären, wie man eine Uhr ausliefern kann, bei der Sensoren und Akku nicht funktionieren oder sich der Ladestecker trotz Austausch nicht sicher verbindet. Und wenn man schon ungefragt Firmwareupdates auf ein Gerät spielt, sollte die Software auch 100% getestet sein.Aus diesen Gründen sende ich die Uhr zurück. Für 360€ hätte ich mehr erwartet. Ich brauche gar nicht alle Funktionen - vieles ist Spielkram - aber das alles sicher und unproblematisch läuft, muss definitiv sein.', ""Have never been a watch wearer so did loads of research before buying this and have no regrets.

I have to wiggle the charging lead around to find a position where it will charge the watch.', 'I like the watch it has some great features but the GPS sometimes gets confused and glitches.The indoor pool swim tracker is not even close to accurate, it adds 25 metres way to quickly (pool length is 25 metres). I did 1500 metres according to the watch but in reality it was around 1000 metres.Battery life drops faster than it saysOther than that so far I’m fairly impressed']"

My previous fitbit battery life was terrible compared to this.I also like having my music loaded onto my watch, so i can walk without carrying my phone.It pairs to my devices easily and the BT connection is good. I have a huawei phone, but i think the only advantage of that is the different watch faces you can download which i like but I could easily live with just the preloaded ones.It looks great, i was worried it might be too big but I love it.Also the watch band does not irritate me like my old fitbit band did.So i definitely recommend this watch.', 'I do not use all of the features and especially not all the time. During the night I switch the watch off and a single battery charge last about six weeks. This is if you do not you all features, just the important ones. Compared to my former smartwatch, made by the so-called market-leader, I had to charge the watch every day. How annoying was this. This smartwatch by Huawei lets you forget that you have a battery-driven mini-computer on your wrist that is not just power-hungry. When people ask me what brand this is I simply say: ""Its a Rolex"". People look embarrassed but the GT2 by Huawei is excellent and so much better than the competition. What a shame that political and ideologically opinion are often damaging the image of an excellent product. Who cares, I call it My Rolex. Believe it or not.', ""I bought the Huawei GT2 after I returned a Samsung Galaxy 3 smartwatch that I got for Christmas (the Galaxy 3 continually disconnected from my phone, it had problems sending through most notifications, and Samsung said that it needed to be repaired when I contacted them even though it was brand new).  I've been very impressed the GT2 as an alternative.  Does what I need it to (fitness tracking, sleep tracking, notifications, ability to take calls on the watch when driving), but it's half the price.  Beautiful screen and excellent battery life.  The bonus watch strap is a nice addition."", ""From the minute I first put the watch on it did everything I needed. Very easy to use, I have a Samsung Galaxy S9+ and the Huawei health app works seamlessly with the watch. I'm a collector of watches and haven't taken it off for the past month. As for the battery life it blew me away and almost lasted 2 weeks between charges.  The fitness sections of the watch are brilliant with many different types of activities it can track. I love it because it also tracks my stress levels and helps me keep it under control.  I also wear it whilst swimming and came with a high quality silicone band and a leather one if you want to dress up and be fancy.

This model is especially elegant and it suits me when I am dressed for an elegant occasion. My Rolex is mothed in and I did not use it since I purchased my first Huawei watch GT some years ago. I have the Huawei G50Pro phone, I love, and I have the three watches and I am very happy with the performance. By the way, Leica cameras in the phones are the best one can purchased and the company is way back from an area Germany loves to forget and so do I, nevertheless, just as Huawei, the products are as good as can be. And so is this watch. Simply elegant.', ""A good little watch. Quite happy with it although there are a couple of things which I find don't meet expectations, likely due to my assumptions of functionality rather than any technical failing.Firstly, I expected of be able to answer calls with the watch, but I can only decline calls.I also expected to be able to respond to messages, but no.And I'm yet to find an instance of two-week battery life; typically it's a week and a half, with little GPS'ing.Bake for money, I still rate it.

I have had the watch for a few weeks now and am pretty impressed. The battery life is very good. I use on average around 10% each day which includes GPS use during my runs. This is much better than my previous fitness smart watch. On the topic of fitness features, it tracks my runs accurately and measures heart rate and the associated Health App analyses your work outs into a range of measurements which I find pretty useful. The screen is big and bright and still sharp when reading it outside on sunny days. One downside would probably be a lack of quality watch faces to choose from.

Overall though, happy with my purchase.', ""This watch is brilliant - looks great, amazing battery life, the microphone and speaker are both clear for taking calls, I'm enjoying the health and sleep tracking and all the detailed analysis and helpful suggestions from the app. The only issue is that I didn't realise it did not support Strava, and it appears there is no plan to do so in future.

It is so light that the kinks in the USB cable lift it of the desk. It wont stay put without blue-tack.I take my watch off at night, and want to put it at my night stand.

Coupled with the blue tack to stop it moving, it's a major eyesore to the bedroom."", ""The battery life is amazing. It really lasts for up to 2 weeks.

Sleep tracking is also a very strong feature and the recommendations to improve your sleep are amazingly accurate. It is truly my everyday life assistant. BUT, BUT, BUT, please be careful when you're purchasing this product. Please make sure that you purchase from Amazon AU store only because they are the ones with official Huawei AU stock.

On top of that, the watch itself is sleek and minimal looking, which I love.If the above is what you're looking for, then the GT2 42mm will fit the bill.If you're looking for a smart watch that integrates with other aspects of your life like messaging, controlling other apps, etc, then this may not be the watch for you."", ""very good product, I could never go back to apple after having this watch, I charge every 10 days or so and I workout every day. would be nice to have more watch faces to choose from, but the ones they have are ok.

The watch itself is well made, and the screen is bright.  One of the main reasons I purchased the watch was to monitor heart rate, sleep, and Sp02.  Unfortunately all of these things appear to be linked to the optical heart rate monitor, which won\'t work through tattoo sleeves.  That leaves the only other benefits as the workout tracker, which seems to be slightly off from a GPS and timing point of view when compared to an iphone (watch was connected to my Samsung, with workouts in parallel), and the music storage option, which allows me to leave my phone at home when training.  I\'ve only tried the workout tracker on cycling so far, so will give the running workout a go later on.  Unfortunately there is no auto pause option on the workouts, so will need to remember to hit the ""up"" button to pause at traffic lights.It did look like the pace wasn\'t being recorded on my bike ride this morning, but I\'ll know more after my run as I need the pace notifications during the run.Extremely disappointed so far. :-(', ""Battery life is good, I got about 9 days with plenty of changing watch faces and trying new features in the first week. 14 days is theoretically possible but with the bare minimum of interaction so not really what you will get in practice.

Ticwatch E3 Smart Watch Wear OS by Google Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100 Platform Health Monitor Fitness Tracker GPS NFC IP68 Waterproof iOS/Android Compatible ,https://www.amazon.com.au/Ticwatch-Qualcomm-Snapdragon-Waterproof-Compatible/dp/B0953PW1MD,"[""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Ticwatch E3 ticks most of the boxes when it comes to features. Minimalist design with latest snapdragon 4100 at a budget friendly price. From step counting to O2 level monitoring this watch is packed with features. Silicon strap that comes with the watch is good quality. Even though the watch feels a bit bulky at 12.6mm, it is very comfortable to wear. I haven't tried all the workout modes but normal step counting, sleep tracking seems to work fine.Snap 4100 chip paired with 1gb ram makes the watch work without any issues. I haven't faced a single lag yet. Battery seems to last good with 24hr Heartrate and O2 level monitoring, fully charged last day and after 20 hrs of normal usage still got 40% left.Calls can be answered straight from the watch and the speaker is loud enough for an indoor environment. Mic quality is decent no one complained about my voice being distorted or too low.LCD display is one of the drawbacks of the watch but it is sharp and colours are good. Sunlight legibility is not an issue but the brightness needs to be increased manually since there is no ambient light sensor present. Double click on the top button increases the brigntess to maximinum for a small amount of time which helps under direct sunlight.Overall for the price this watch is very good. Considering the fact that Google will be releasing the wear OS 3.0 in early 2022, Ticwatch E3 will be one of the watches to get it."", 'Design and Build:-impressive design , stylish frame, which makes the watch look amazing, has a good build and light weight but there’s one flaw that it’s design makes its screen extremely prominent to damage while use .Features and OS:- The google wear OS works very fine on this beautiful watch along with its connectivity features ( nfc, Bluetooth,wifi), first watch I have seen with Google pay at this price point, it makes payment convenient efficiently. Watch faces offered by Mobvoi are a big bonus😍.It has many workout modes, I have tried 4 of those and they worked out pretty accurate with your workout and health details. It has swim workout tracker that is a very extraordinary feature as it lets your track your activity and health details while swimming( so amazing 🤯 ). It can even track your sleep 😴.Battery and charging:- The charging speed of this watch is impressive( it charges at an amazing speed). Battery life is good, lasts 2 days on normal mode but it drains very quick while tracking any workout or if you use it while connected to wifi.CONCLUSION:- an all rounder attractive looking smartwatch with an extremely affordable price tag. There are some minor flaws though, but they can be ignored by that extremely affordable and competitive price tag. Rest everything about this watch is beautiful.💯💯💯', ""Honestly a great all round budget smart watch, if you're worried about future proof of this watch, no need to. The snap dragon 4100 built into this watch is more than capable of scrolling through the apps and notifications super smoothly. Was very surprised of the performance. With Samsung and Google's collaboration this year, wear os (the operating system) is due to get a revamp which has already been confirmed for this watch, which I can't wait for. The battery life is OK... If you have a watch face that doesn't show too much you'll have more than a day of use. Style of this watch is one thing I was kinda disappointed about. The big bezzels are distracting to the eye as well... But if you're looking for a smart watch that does everything a $400 Samsung watch 4 does, and your on a budget? This is a pretty damn good option for the price."", 'This definitely is the coolest smartwatch I’ve owned so far.Looks - 5 stars - I’ve always admired watches with a round dial against the square, rectangle ones.It was easy to set-up. Really cool watch faces available and can be changed with a single tap and is updated within seconds.Looking forward to set-up Google pay and use other features such as being able to respond to texts and taking calls from the watch.Very reasonably priced keeping in mind the features it offers in comparison to other brands. Will definitely recommend.', 'Bought this watch, arrived on time, maybe not my lucky day.. :(. Sadly my wife not very happy when she saw green vertical lines on the lcd screen after she switched On.We end up to return it back and choose another brand instead.']"

I received constant updates for the delivery from both my Amazon app, and my Australia Post app. The watch itself is exactly as I expected, as it was replacing an Apple Watch 2. Setup was made slightly more complicated, because Apple force you to update your iPhone to the latest OS (15.1), which was problematic, and which I wasn't keen to do because of the problems that are currently being found on the OS!! Once setup, the watch display is so clear and easy to read, and I really like the 'Always On' function, which doesn't really drain the battery ....as I had expected."", 'Liked the bigger screen.', 'It was the best purchase I ever did !

"Garmin Instinct, Rugged Outdoor GPS Watch, Graphite ",https://www.amazon.com.au/Garmin-010-02064-00-Instinct-Graphite/dp/B07HYX9P88,"[""I have used this watch now for the last 4 months as a volunteer ES worker. It's been covered in dirt, submerged in stormwater, banged against the truck, etc. etc. Works perfectly, as rugged as advertised. Love that you can use it while wearing gloves, keep the face illuminated as long as needed, and only need to recharge it every few weeks. Former Fitbit users will notice the Connect app is not as fluent or flexible as Fitbit, particularly in terms of measuring sleep accuracy, however I'm actually enjoying the freedom of rating my sleep based on how I am feeling rather than worrying about the amount of deep sleep I got. Very happy with this watch and will stick with it! Other members of my crew have the same watch and also swear by it."", ""Changed to this watch from the Apple Watch - it always felt a bit fragile, and when I'm out doing stuff I was worried it would break. The Instinct is solid and has been everywhere with me - camping, swimming in the open water, getting wood in and during farm work. I've tracked field hockey, tennis and running and it's been great. It's a big and relatively simple watch but does everything I need it to - heart rate tracking, GPS, compass, alerts, time (lulz), calendar etc. I chose the solar edition and it's been nice to get an extra charge here and there when I've been out. With the GPS running and full tracking going the battery life drops faster than normal, but the solar charge offsets that somewhat which is great. I've had this watch now for 4 or 5 weeks and I've charged it 4 times (only once to full charge too - the others have been top ups of 20 - 30%). It's been great. The app on the phone syncs nicely to the watch and has lots of great info extracted from the watch. The body battery has been a game changer - it's prompted a pretty serious review of some habits causing my sleep to be impacted. By using the watch's biometrics I'm feeling better and keeping an eye on things. It's kicks the crap out of the Apple Watch from a sleep management, and exercise perspective. Worth buying if these features are important to you."", ""As this is my second Garmin Instinct watch I was looking forward to using it. That was until I found the battery on this watch last less than a day. My thinking is they didn't want to use 2 types of batterys between their solar version and standard Instinct watches and so just used one type. Though this would also mean their solar version won't last long with out time in the sun."", 'Pros. Long lasting battery, fairly accurate, rugged watch that is good for outdoors activities, face is easy to read in most conditions, use it more than the Fenix 6x Pro now. Has all the necessary modes/functions for outdoor use, including skydiving,I have added glass screen and silicone case protectors.Cons. Not an issue for me: Cannot use with Connect IQ mobile app, has less functions than other Garmin watches, which have no use when outdoors.', ""Solar recharging doesn't work correctly. Periodically stops working then I have to switch the watch off and then on to get it working again. Had it exposed fully to the sun but no data. In my view I should have saved the huge price difference and purchased the standard Instinct. Cant see the value in the Solar. Garmin support very slow to respond - still waiting to find out what is going to happen."", 'Took it for hiking today for the first time and tried the hiking function, man it delivered as what it had promoted to be.. light watch, clear, easy to customised and provides near to accurate navigation. Linking up with GPS satellite is fast and the track back function is simply brilliant... A brilliant buy... Overall ratings:  A+', 'Have not become familiar with all functions yet but the basic time , date and including heart rate monitor, charge indication and  charge execution are all very easy to work with.  The watch has been counting walking, swimming and  kayaking stokes  well to my anticipation  but  I have not checked in any detail for accuracy at this point. Definitely need to spend a little more time reading the manual to discover and practice more of the functionally of this watch. The menu logic is also quite intuitive to my surprise as an older user that struggles a bit with the myriad of newer devices placed in our path these days.', ""Wow what a watch, it promises to do everything except wash the car. I didn't get to explore this as the ABC sensor compass was out 40 degrees. Down loaded the user manual and recalibrated it as on page 20 to see no improvement so back in the box it must go.

It's great looking and very functional. Awesome really. The main reason I purchased this watch is because live altimeter is especially important to me as a runner. Unfortunately, the altimeter sensor is located on the back of the watch. I sweat a lot and my sweat was interacting with the sensor, causing erroneous readings. If you don’t sweat a lot, it would probably be ok. Instead I purchased a Fenix 5, which has the senor on the side…..very accurate and I’m delighted with that watch."", 'This watch is best for who want a smart watch but also lead an active lifestyle. I do not need to worry about damaging the body or screen as the bezel is tough plastic resin and protects the screen from most impacts by design alone.Battery life is solid, as long as you turn off full time GPS and energy blood oxygen measuring as these are especially high battery use functions.Using the watch does take a few days to get used to but nothing to bad. Visibility of the screen is excellent throughout the day. Also customisable.Excellent watch for what it is. A bit pricey.', ""so what drew me to this watch is that i want to start hiking and it has the 3 satellite connections and it can take you back to your starting point if you get lost!! (not yet tested,  i will need to learn some navigation skills 1st before i can tell if it's accurate)The instinct monitors my heart, stress and sleep which are 3 things important to me and of course daily step count. i could only find those 3 features in a fitbit and that was double the price of this watch!!  (apparently the apple version of sleep is no good so it was already discounted - apple again is more expensive). it also links up to my fitness pal. between the 2 i'm pretty sure everything is covered for health and wellness. however, if you're in group fitness like i am, i have had to add in each exercise manually via the app on my phone.this watch is rugged and made for being outdoors - so i'm not always worried about scratching it or getting it wet etc. the battery life is awesome!! over 2 weeks and still a bar left :DIt takes a while to navigate your way around the watch - but once you're used to it, then it's fine. I found the manual online.i have no regrets choosing this watch over my other choices. it suits me now and it's got the features i want for my future outdoor adventures so i will grow into this watch. The bonus is it didn't cost me the earth!! after all, if given a choice of spending $800 on a watch or $800 on a return trip to Asia, i'd pick the holiday every single time!!"", ""I've had other Garmin fitness trackers and they have worked well and have been waterproof for swimming which is a feature I need.  I upgraded recently to the Instinct and it's working without problems.  Since I do a reasonable amount of physical work I needed something a bit more rugged that can take a knock or two.  The Instinct has a very readable display, even underwater through goggles, and so far has very good battery life between charges.  I'm well pleased and the price was right also."", ""It worked well on the first day. It counted my steps, it measured my heart rate, etc. Then on the second day, it turned into a potato. I woke up and the battery was dead. I recharged it and put it on. It had stopped counting my steps and was no longer picking up my pulse. I went to work and before lunch I was getting low-battery alerts, so I just turned it off. Came home, charged it again, factory reset, but it didn't help.I'm returning it, and frankly I'm a bit shaken as a loyal Garmin user (this was my 4th Garmin watch). I'm not even going to order another one right away."", ""I researched alot of watches and just needs it to work as advertised. The watches battery life is amazing due to the solar power system. I have had the watch for 3 weeks and have not needed to charge via the cable. It's remains on 33 days remaining. I use it primarily as watch and step counter and ABC functions. The heart rate and alarms I don't really use so I have them switched off. I have had Gshock solar and Protrek solar watches for years and this is just as good and has more functionality.Love it and would easily recommend purchasing."", 'May not be as fancy as my Galaxy smartwatch, but its tough, rugged and packs all the features needed for my daily and outdoor activities.  What more it has battery that last forever.  Had this for almost 3 weeks now amd charged it only once.  Worth the price especially at a big discount is a big plus.', ""Bought purely because phone GPS wasn't accurate and occasionally stopped all together. This watch is very accurate with GPS and has made recording, pausing and uploading Strava sessions extremely easy. Heart rate monitor works well even with aggressive MTB riding. You can also turn off phone call and message functionality, I did as I only wanted time + GPS. Great battery life as well though you do notice that long rides with GPS do hit the battery hard but still plenty left in the tank."", ""Still finding out all the features. Great watch with great features. However, in the absence of internet connections, the instructions included with the watch are very lean and could include a lot more info. A lot of time is wasted fiddling with buttons before getting the appropriate screen/settings. That said, it pairs nicely with my phone, something I've not had before and that I find very useful. Don't get me wrong - its a great product and I'm loving it."", 'Great little watch, still learning all the features, have noticed that the accuracy seems only a little off when out doing activities but does refresh and update once back home.

The app useful and informative, but it is annoying to have to keep going between ""device"" and ""health"" tabs to do different things, which I suppose is how they organise it to cater to people with multiple devices. It just makes it more troublesome for those like me with only one. The reason I give tyhe product and overall 2, however, is because os the unforgivable app permissions. The app outright cannot be used without putting in my personal phone number, so that it can confirm who I am. Why the F does it need to know who I am? And given this is Huawei we are talking about, you\'d think they\'d know better than to go sticking their nose into people\'s privacy. The app also continually asks for permissions that it doesnt need, and it keeps asking and asking. I will never give in; I just say no every time.

You can change your watch faces by downloading via the Huawei health app. There are 96 workout modes to choose from.

It really doesn't and especially you're a more slim or petit female it really wouldn't fit nicely. The watch face part and where it bends over your wrist is too long. So if you have thick bone or thick wrist it's great. Otherwise it's not."", ""While it's pretty and comfortable... it doesn't work accurately at all. Measured against medical equipment often, the data was wildly off. According to the watch I was at 81% oxygen in my blood... official testing at the time said 99%, that quite the difference.

I got 6 days with notifications which is very impressive.I would have given a 5 star rating but the charging of the band is not as per the description, it has a separate charger, I would have like if it was like Band 4 - USB type as it would be easier to charge if battery goes low at work.apart from that I would recommend this band any time. its the best on the market at very good price.', ""I've been using it for about 1 week and overall it was a good buy for an entry-level health band.  It does lack some of the key features of the more expensive alternatives.Pros:-Has 24hr heart rate monitor (simpler version) and customisable-SPO2 measurement-A reasonably detailed sleep tracker-Integrated GPS-Aesthetically pleasingCons:-The heart monitor doesn't have heart rate variability (HRV) which is used to measure stress levels. If that's important to you, don't buy it.-Integrated GPS uses a lot of battery. If you have 24/7 Heart rate turned on and GPS and notifications, the battery will last 3 days max.-requires wifi for the app to analyse the data which is strange? (not sure if this is standard)-There may be a privacy issue given it requires wifi when it probably shouldn't.So if you just want to try a health band this is a good buy but if you are serious about detailed measurement to improve your health or monitor your condition, this is not the right item for you, go for a 200+ dollar smartwatch."", 'I have waited 1 month before reviewing this product,For the price this is an amazing product, i get around 10-12 days battery life with this watch (amazing).The USB charging is a great idea, no need to buy anything additional.I have a large hand, so it looks nice and small for my hand.

There is a detailed manual under the help menu on the app. I was very impressed with the GPS. Selected outdoor run and it locked onto me in 3 seconds and then mapped the route perfectly. Great post run analytics with graphs of heart rate, pace and cadence that overlay each other as an option. Tried the option for outdoor walk for mowing the lawn but this didn't work so well (the map was out a bit) but I didn't really expect it to. Some options are listed on the app but not part of the device (e.g., climbing of stairs, stress). The sleep measure is perhaps a little inaccurate saying I'm dreaming when I'm actually still getting back to sleep. The app gives handy tips though for improving sleep quality.

"UMIDIGI Smart Watch Uwatch3 Fitness Tracker, Smart Watch for Android Phones, Activity Tracker Smartwatch for Women Men Kids, with Sleep Monitor All-Day Heart Rate 5ATM Waterproof ",https://www.amazon.com.au/UMIDIGI-Uwatch3-Activity-Smartwatch-Waterproof/dp/B083DVLF4V,"[""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0The Umidigi Uwatch3 GPS Smart Watch with Built-in GPS is delightful, lightweight, comfortable, easy to wear and meets all of your fitness and health tracking needs.The striking, attractive rubber wristband with the red stripe makes the watch so much easier to see - and more importantly - to easily find. The rubber itself is very comfortable, durable and so lightweight that you almost forget that the watch is even on your wrist.The watch face is bright, very clear and easy to see even in outdoor light.On the reverse is the heart rate and pulse sensor as well as a really well designed magnetic charge connection point.The USB charge cable easily snaps on and off. That's a really nice feature because there is no fiddling around with micro usb sockets. There's no breakable ends. It just pops on and off so quickly and easily.The watch face features a very clear charge indicator so as soon as it it's about 99% or 100% you can just easily disconnect and away you go.Navigation around the watch face is super simple. It's just a matter of flicking with your finger from left to right and up and down to access the various parts of the menu that interest you.In the sports section you can monitor outdoor and indoor runs, outdoor walks, outdoor and indoor cycling, cricket, indoor and open water swimming as well. These activities can be tracked by the GPS with the data uploaded to the Very Fit Pro App that you can download to your Apple or Android device.The watch face also allows you to access the heart rate sensor, the relaxation sensor, alarm, music controller, timer, weather, sports record and settings. There really is something for everyone.Of course many of the above functions can be synchronised with your Android device via the Very Fit Pro app.The app also allows you to customise the look of the front screen of the watch and you can choose from a number of different designs according to your preferences.One of the most impressive features of the watch is the battery life.I ran this watch for about 10 days without any charge just to see how long the battery would last.On day 10 the battery still had about 45% left.The watch instruction manual says it has about a 5 to 7 Day battery life - but obviously that would be with maximum intensity use. In reality, I found that with just normal, day-to-day use - you can get at least 10 days with 45% still in the tank.In such situations the battery would probably last for up to 14 to 20 days - which is quite impressive.So if you forget your charge cable and you're away from home for a week or two - just relax - it's not a problem.A nice feature of the watch is the Very Fit Pro app that you allows you to monitor all of your activities.You can monitor your sleep and set up call alerts, a sedentary alert alarm alert and SMS alert. There's also settings for music controls and heart rate detection.It's quite comprehensive.It also presents graphs to monitor your activities from day to day and your sleep patterns.There's average statistics for each day across a range of activities. So all in all these are very nice features to sync with the watch, and use from day to day to monitor your fitness and health levels.The Umidigi UWatch 3 GPS is a very well priced solution for anyone who wants to monitor their health and activity levels and get a clear picture of their overall performance.It's comfortable, lightweight and looks like many of the much more expensive smart watches on the market.For the price and performance you'll be quite satisfied with what Umidigi has delivered in this delightful, day-to-day, high tech health and fitness companion."", 'Ordered this for my son as a Christmas Gift. It did not charge, it did not respond to any stimulus. Disappointment.Returned and bought a new one. Worked for maybe two weeks after that refused to charge, went blank and did not respond to any stimulus.

(aka China). No wonder it does not work.', ""I got this because I switched to a Samsung phone AFTER I already had an Apple watch so needed something to notify me when I got calls. This lets me know when a call is coming through when the phone is on silent and I can also read texts.  I also use the timer and it's handy to have the 'find my phone' option too. Use the app to check on sleep patterns and heart rate. Seems to be accurate enough. For the price I paid and for the functions I use it for, I'm pretty happy with this watch. The battery is good too. No need to charge it for days and I wear it 24/7."", ""Got this watch a couple of weeks ago. It does exactly what is described. Good watch for the price paid. Would've been helpful if it had more features such as showing the weather, BP monitor, more watch faces etc, but I guess it's too much to ask for this budget. Had a few issues initially with the watch face waking up with the flick of my wrist, but it was set right once I turned the setting on and off on the app. Great activity/sleep tracking. Overall I'm happy with the purchase!"", 'I bought the pink, within 9days all my strap was blue off my jeans, might add old jeans washed for 3 years, and a navy blue jumper been washed loads no matter how you try to clean it it will not come off, consequently the watch looks scruffy......doesn’t do a lot you get what you pay for worth $10 would not recommend at all DO NOT BUY PINK....VERY DISSATISFIED', 'I have been using this watch for little more than 2 weeks now and love everything about this watch. The best thing about this watch is its battery life. It has been more than 2 weeks from first charge and it is still going compare this to my last watch needing recharging almost everyday really impressive.Also this watch in rose gold(pink) looks amazingly beautiful, and it has been mistaken for big brand expensive watch by my friends and co workers. Ask them how much they think I paid for it and the figure most of them come up is 9-10 times higher what I paid for it.The display is great too. Responsive to gesture movements ,great colours, simple user interface connects easily to the app, step counter is accurate enough for measuring distance done during run for a watch without GPS. Good range of workout tracking although they could added a few more for people who are doing lot more kind of workouts but for me who mainly do running it is great.I think it is very good watch for the price you pay for it. I would say best value for money I have used till now.', 'I got this because I wanted to track how many calories I burned during a run/workout/walk etc without buying an Apple Watch. It’s great for that! Can also see FB messages, incoming calls or skip songs which is an added bonus. Can’t text or reply which I don’t mind. Downside is the steps and calories burnt don’t sync with the health app on your iPhone and the band (I got pink stains easily, mine is all black from jumpers rubbing on the rubber etc)', ""I have been wearing it for 2 weeks. I must say this watch is very good for its price. Long lasting battery, looks fancy, comfortable, very light, connects well with my umidigi power 3, reads heart beat, counts steps. The only downside I would say is lift wrist sense is slow and sometimes it doesn't work at all and I have to press button on the side to wake it up"", 'Really fast shipping. Long battery life. Working as it promised. However, I went to beach with toddler daughter and right after watch dip in about 20cm, charging light was on and stopped working... In the description, it says it is light water proof. It might be I got a bad unit. The return was smooth and straight away. I was ready to send them but my car broken into so it got stolen.... :( (To owner, if you gracious send one, I would be grateful. :)) If this is your first smart watch, give it a try. it is a product worth try.', ""I use it to count my daily steps , and have had a few different fitness trackers, I find if I count 300 steps in my head, then look at my watch its spot on, and that is the important part for me, I want it to tell me the steps I have done , not more not less ..........so that's very good..........the screens could be better with more display of date time amount of steps and calories on the front screen , but I knew what i was getting, so happy""]"
"Smart Watch, Popglory Smartwatch with Blood Pressure, Blood Oxygen Monitor, Fitness Tracker with Heart Rate Monitor, Full Touch Fitness Watch Compatible with Android & iOS for Men Women ",https://www.amazon.com.au/Popglory-Smartwatch-Pressure-Monitor-Compatible/dp/B08DXKC653,"[""I've read many reviews before buying this smart watch to use primarily as a HRM for fitness tracking. I want to like it  but unfortunately I'm returning it after a few days of using because it's simply not accurate. When resting with my ave HR of 65bpm, the error is tolerable (compared it to my iphone HR monitor and with my Garmin monitor). The problem is when I start to perform basis exercises (like push-up), my Garmin monitor would show my HR peaking over 120bpm while the watch would not go over 95bpm. As another example (see attached photos), I've tested it on a bicycle ride for an hour. My Garmin would have an ave HR of 134bpm with a max of 154 while the watch would be 86 and 125 respectively. I know from my experience that the error is with the watch.What I also did not like about this watch is the sleep monitor function. It appears that this function only works automatically b/n 8:00pm and 10:00am and that it cannot be turned on or off manually. This is not good if one sleep outside this period or if one need to charge your watch during this period.Overall, I'm disappointed that it does not work as advertised. I didn't expect it be accurate as my Garmin but the margin of error is not acceptable."", ""I bought this watch a while ago, and I really like it. It values for money. It got many functions and all works very well. The most functions I like are the blood pressure monitor, sleep status monitor, distance and step calculator, and stop watch. I don't have good sleep during night, and I want to monitor how bad of my sleep during night and take some treatment. This function on this watch works so well, it tells me how long I stay in bed for sleep, how long my light sleep is, and how long my deep sleep is, which are exactly what I need and I want to improve. The blood pressure monitor works well as well. The step calculator is extremely important for me, previously I use phone to monitor but I don't carry my phone all the time. This watch monitor my calories burn so well and encourages me to do more exercise as I can set up a goal and if I haven't reached to my goal, I need to do more activity. The stopwatch is a good one, as I don't need to hold it, it's my watch. It totally replaced my normal watch and it works so well. I can see time during the night or dark, I can set up the night model so it wouldn't be too bright. I can also use it as a torch during the night if I need to get up and move. I don't need to worry I lost my watch somewhere as it's so cheap and it's so comfortable, I don't want to take it off. I also like the weather function. It got so many functions, more than I expected. I always want to buy a smart watch, and this is exactly what I want. The battery last so long, I don't need to worry about it. It shows on the watch, when the battery is low, I can see it and I know when I should recharge it. It's not like the normal watch, we don't know when we need to change the battery. It is like a mini phone, it contains so many functions, control the music, control the call, take a photo, control the camera, see a message, a phone call, etc. All in all, I really love it and I wear it everyday. Plus it's so easy to set up, just scan the QR code in the manual and download an app through the phone, the watch can be fully functional. So cool! I will recommend it to all my friends, and I am really excited to wear it everyday!"", 'I thought I’d take a punt on this given the price.  It worked well. For a few days.In the period it did work (4th-10th June 2021):PROS:Cost.It charged quickly.The strap is of good length so suitable for bigger wrists as well as skinny ones.CONS:The screen flickers at night which wakes me up. And if it’s on charge rather than in my wrist the green charger light also flickers through the night, also waking me up.  In fairness I’m a light sleeper.Lifespan is terrible. Not even a week 😞I don’t regret giving it a go.  My Apple Watch lasted 6 years but the battery didn’t last the day - I’m an active person 😂 I didn’t like the Fitbit so thought I’d try the cheapie to see how that worked.Lesson learned.

I found this Popglory watch on Amazon, and I convinced myself to gave it a try, it was only $40 anyway, what more could I lose? But the results completely surprised me, in a good way.I was initially quite sceptical about this watch's advertised functions, as it was only a very short while ago since Apple released their new Series 6 Apple Watch that had the blood pressure monitoring function; it was just unreal to me that a  $40 cheap 'knock-off' can have the same function. But it did!Over the past 5 days of using this watch, I have actively and regularly checked my blood pressure and heart rates, against the clinical blood pressure monitor we had in the lab, and surprisingly, this Popglory produced some reasonable results (around 10% inaccuracy - which was good enough for all this type of devices). This is really a good feature to have.Another function that I was keen was the sleep cycle monitor, which appears to be quite accurate so far; and I quite enjoy wearing it overnight. It is a very comfortable watch on my wrist, not too tight and very light & soft on your wrist too. With that said, I would not use it to replace my daily watch (an actual watch), I treat this watch more or less like a fitness monitor, and it does a much better job for the price that I paid for.Considering all the above, if you want a replacement watch for your fancy $1000 Apple Watch, this Popglory watch is not for you. However, if you want a simply and functional smart fitness watch, then, this is a perfect fit for you.

I was able to personalise the step goal, and the app displays my heart rate and sleep history. When I personally checked the heart rate feature, it was correct. It charges quickly and barely uses any energy during the day, which is a significant improvement over my previous model.I'm normally supposed to get a second, smaller band because the main one never fits into my wrist but it fits nicely on the little buckles.

The resolution is poor, the viewing angle is tiny and the colour is awful. It’s like a screen from a 1995 laptop.And to make it worse they didn’t even put the screen in straight on the one I bought. It’s off from the 12 o’clock position by about 2mm.The effect of the poor screen is in the apps. From a feature perspective the built-in apps are great. But they look awful. And the poor screen limits what developers can do with the display meaning the apps are very basic. I suspect this is also the reason why there are no decent 3rd party apps.Having said all that the apps for the accompanying device (phone or whatever) are pretty good - better than the ones for my watch.The watch looks pretty good though - screen aside - but when you get close to it you can see the build quality isn’t on the Samsung/Apple level at all.If you’re serious about exercise and health (and want a watch that isn’t massive) this may be the watch for you. But if you want funky watch faces and cool apps it definitely isn’t.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0This was my second garmin watch previously having Vivoactive music 3 which was much better than this one.This one broke after 2and a half months. It just stopped responding. I have sent the watch for repair and was told it will be returned to me within 3 weeks. Which didn’t happen. I had to be contacting them on a few occasions and was told that I will receive a refund on the end which didn’t happen either.  It’s been nearly 5 weeks now and I have no watch and no refund. This is the first time ever I’m not happy with the customer service at Amazon. They just keep saying to wait and that they have no update on the watch.This watch doesn’t last long without charging it and the only credit I give to this watch is that it is a good looking watch.  Not worth the money and very bad experience for me.', ""A mixed bag for me. As a fitness tracker, it works well. The GPS is very good and I liked that you can sync with Spotify if you're a premium user. However, there were too many deal-breakers, so I am returning the product.The sleep tracking is dire. I know the tech is hard on this one, but I experienced one very sleepless night whilst using this. It told me I got about 2h of REM sleep but during these times I was actually walking around making cups of tea, before sitting up to watch YouTube videos on my phone.The screen quality is also a bit rubbish. This is my main reason for returning the watch. I thought about exchanging it for the Venu, which is basically the same watch but with an AMOLED screen, however, for that price I could get an Apple Watch S3 and have change in my pocket!The yoga tracking was confusing. You seemed to have to tell it every move you did - no intuition.I can't comment on notifications as I turned them all off. I don't want texts, calls and emails on my wrist, thanks.I liked the running tracking on this, but it's a very expensive step/distance calculator! I didn't get on with the Garmin running plans (they seemed to be long term plans, whereas I wanted in-run motivation). I ended up taking my phone out on runs with me so I could have Nike Run Club coaching.So, with a heavy heart, I am returning this and giving in to the lure of Apple, which is a much better all-round watch for a not-dissimilar price.It looks kind of cute (though why don't they make a black and rose gold one? The white casing on the rose gold looks cheap and prevents making it into a more elegant watch, with a strap change). The smaller size did fit my tiny wrists quite well."", 'Scheinbar habe ich Glück gehabt und eine Uhr erwischt,  die keine Probleme mit dem Akku hat.

Ansonsten eine top Uhr.Und der Preis von 299 € hat mich schon zögern lassen,  der ist ganz schön happig.', 'This was my first fitness watch. After 6 months of trying to decide what to get (apple  or garmin) I bit the bullet and bought this. In some ways I love it. Nice looking watch and very handy for workouts - you can install your own ones quite easily and the GPS tracking is brilliant.But there are a few issues. The Bluetooth falls off a lot so you have to constantly log into the app to refresh it.The running app only tracks in miles and not kilometres even though I changed it over to KM.The Bluetooth earphones don’t connect every time so you have to uninstall and reinstall which can be quite testing because it’s not straight forward.Overall I wouldn’t say it’s worth the money it costs.', 'This should be so good and when it works it is but I have only had it a month and in that time I have had to completely reconnect with my phone as it disconnects without warning. The music feature is also completely defunct unless I am prepared to pay over £50 for a compatible pair of headphones. This is despite the headphones I have connecting fine initially but again, they just stopped working and now won’t even connect to the watch.In terms of accuracy it seems fine and battery life is ok but the flakiness in the Bluetooth connectivity means I can’t give a positive review of the watch....and I really wanted to like it.', 'Crammed with applications and features.Did a lot of research into what would be the best sports watch whilst something that looked feminine as a gift for my wife and this won hands down. The Apple Watch looks too clunky whereas this looks like a traditional watch. The number of apps available is extensive and so you can tailor make your own training/fitness/diet/ lifestyle programs. The boffins at Garmin have done superb work  in creating a super long life battery for this watch, 4-5 Days?? UnbelievableDid I mention that it monitors your sleep patterns and advises you on you activity for the day ahead based on your sleep quality??It does all this and a lot lot more as well as connecting effortlessly to your phone for calls and messages.

Gefühlt hat nichts auf Anhieb funktioniert, der Akku war in kürzester Zeit leer, ich war ständig nur am Resetten, Neustarten und in allen möglichen Foren zu lesen. Selbst im Corona Lockdown habe ich eigentlich besseres zu tun. Was die Uhr gerettet hat, ist ihr tolles Aussehen, sie ist leicht und passt auch an mein wirklich schmales Handgelenk super gut. Und die Tatsache, dass sie für mich persönlich einfach alle Funktionen vereint die ich (glaube zu) benötige(n). Also habe ich ihr wirklich viele Chancen gegeben und bin im Nachhinein froh, sie nicht zurück geschickt zu haben (obwohl ich bei der Einrichtung und dem anfänglichen Testen mehrmals kurz davor war).Zum Akku, mit diversen Einstellungs-Anpassungen komme ich auf 5 Tage. Dabei ist die Helligkeit auf 30%, Benachrichtigungen / Bluetooth, sowie die HF-Messung angeschaltet und ich habe nur ein simples digitales Watchface. Alles andere (Widgets wie die Wasser-Erinnerung, PulsOx, PhysioTruUp, Display an mit Geste, etc.etc.) ist aus. Wenn ich die Uhr lade wenn sie aus ist, lädt sie max. 99%, bzw. benötigt anscheinend 1% fürs hochfahren.MIt Musik und GPS zieht die Uhr in 1,5h 30% Akku, nur GPS benötigt in derselben Zeit 10%. Synchronisierung mit meiner Spotify-Offline-Liste hat gut funktioniert, auch die Verbindung zu meinen BT Kopfhörern.Die Koppelung mit Huawei-Geräten ist anscheinend generell eine Herausforderung, es gibt dazu im Garmin Forum einen entsprechenden Eintrag. Selbst all die Ratschläge dort befolgend hatte ich zunächst Probleme. Die Verbindung brach regelmäßig ab und selbst mit bestehender Verbindung poppt bei mir auf dem P30 immer wieder eine Meldung hoch, dass keine Nachrichten übermittelt werden können, und ich mein Handy neustarten soll. Mir hilft hier folgendes: in den Handy-Einstellungen nach ""Benachrichtigungszugriff"" suchen. Huawei-Start muss auf an stehen. Wenn das Problem ansonsten auftritt hilft es mir, hier den Zugriff für die Connect-App einfach zu deaktivieren und wieder zu aktivieren.Garmin Pay war eine der Funktionen die ich nur durch Reset der Uhr einrichten konnte (es wurde nach einem Update der Uhr gefragt, obwohl die aktuelle Version installiert war). Danach lief es aber sehr flüssig. Ich reise viel und wollte mir sowieso ein Konto bei Revolut einrichten. Das geht super einfach, ist kostenlos, und ich lasse das jetzt einfach als Prepaid-Konto laufen (ist über die Revolut-App so schnell aufgeladen, dass man das sogar notfalls auch noch beim Warten an der Kasse erledigen kann). Hinterlegung meiner digitalen Revolut-Kreditkarte zum Handy lief nach den anfänglichen Schwierigkeiten problemlos. Das kontaktlose Bezahlen hat damit bisher überall schnell & easy funktioniert.Ich hatte auch mit der Venu geliebäugelt, bin aber mit dem Display der Vivoactive 4s absolut zufrieden. Selbst bei 30% Helligkeit kann ich es sehr gut ablesen. Der Touchscreen funktioniert gut und die Menüführung einigermaßen sinnvoll. Man kennt sich schnell aus. Auch die Alarm/Timer Funktion finde ich super, benutze das gerne und bin froh, dass es so prominent verfügbar ist.Wenn man selbst in der Lage ist, die Garmin-Foren-Einträge zu lesen, braucht man den Support eigentlich nicht anzuschreiben, denn alles was sie tun, ist Links aus diesem Forum zu schicken. Mir haben neben den Rezensionen hier auch die im Playstore bei der Connect App geholfen.', ""For the first 3 months worked like a dream, then it wouldn't charge. Contacted Garmin who tried a few options to sort the problem but nothing worked. Returned expecting a new replacement from Garmin but received a refurbished watch. OK so not the end of the world... at least it worked. A year later that has the same issues. Will not charge. It has the latest software updates but it's dead. Clearly Garmin know this watch has issues but of course won't admit it. Lovely design, but design doesn't measure your training"", ""Use this watch for mostly running and work outs at the moment and it has been great. It's very comfortable to wear and the monitors appear acccurate. The only thing that isn't the best is the sleep stuff, this appears less than accurate as I sat up one night reading as I couldn't sleep and that was on my watch as asleep! Also pulse Ox is very draining on the battery and its only lasted 2 days. Other than that the data is good and I'm pretty pleased with it so far."", 'I love the way that this watch looks. Really stylish.The tracking in the watch is great, brilliant for working out and GPS tracking running, bike rides ect.The only down side to this watch is the Bluetooth connection to my phone.

Das macht die Uhren entweder unnötig groß... oder die Displays unnötig klein.Bei der Vivomove 4 S fällt der schwarze Rand besonders auf.Bei anderen Herstellern hat der Rand meist eine Funktion, oder wird durch eine Lünette abgedeckt.Über die Art des Displays gibt es nicht viel zu sagen... Es hat seine Vor und Nachteile und man weiß eigentlich worauf man sich einlässt. Die vergleichsweise lange Akkulaufzeit liegt nun mal auch im Display begründet.Akkulaufzeit:Hier kommt der Punkt bei dem Garmin noch vorn liegt (Sofern die Firmware mitspielt)3 Tage mit je 1 Stunde GPS am Tag sind durchaus möglich.Man muss jedoch die Auto Aktivitätserkennung abschalten. Sonst meint die Uhr bei jedem Besuch im Westflügel das GPS anwerfen zu müssen, was auf die Laufzeit geht.Funktionen:Die Frau nutzt sie zum Pilates, Gehen, Radfahren und für den Notfall hat sie noch meine KK mit Garmin Pay.Der Schnickschnack wie Mentruationskalender, Wasserkonsum etc. wurde deaktiviert.VO2 brauchen wir nicht... erst recht nicht beim Schlafen.Pulsfunktion ist 24h aktiv.Musikfunktionen nutzen wir ebenfalls nicht.Die Uhr bietet so wesentlich mehr Funktionen als benötigt (Daher war die Vivomove Reihe unser Favorit)Die Funktionen die wir nutzen, sind Problemfrei.Connectivität:BLE funktionierte bei Garmin eigentlich immer. WLAN braucht es für unsere Einsatzzwecke nicht.Wichtiger Punkt... die App wird immer besser und da Endomondo seinen Dienst Ende des Jahres einstellt. für uns fast alternativlos.Smart Watch:Garmin Pay und dazu noch eingehende Nachrichten/Anrufe anzeigen.Wichtigste Funktion ist wohl ""Handy suchen""Fazit.Die Uhr ist nicht unsere 1. Wahl, erfüllt jedoch ihren Zweck.1 Stern Abzug für den verschwendeten Platz vom Display.An den Funktionen die WIR  nutzen gibt es nix zu meckern.Akkulaufzeit ist immer noch gut... aber so langsam holen die Mitbewerber auf.@ Garmin und ohne Einfluss auf die Bewertung.Akkulaufzeit, Pay Funktionen ... die Konkurrenz ist dran und bietet zudem meist Wireless Charging.Das Gefummel mit dem seit ~15 Monaten eingeführtem Ladestecker ist so was an der Zeit vorbei und auch die Datenübertragung via Basecamp (betrifft eher Fenix/Oregon etc.)  und USB ist weit überholt.Dazu noch Metall statt Plastik. (welches sich nach ein paar Monaten auch gern verfärbt)Wir haben zur Garmin gegriffen, weil sie noch das bessere Bundle für uns ist... nach den Enttäuschungen mit der Fenix, dem Oregon 700 und der Vivomove Style schaut man doch etwas interessierter in Nachbars Garten.Zumal unsere Kritik ziemlich ähnlich zu der aus dem restlichen Bereich der Community ist.', 'My wife loves it batt life amazing well worth the money.

Als zufriedener Besitzer einer Fenix 5 war also Garmin schon mal gesetzt. Die Frage war also Fenix 6S Pro oder Vivoactive 4S. Meiner Frau mit dünnem Handgelenk gefiel die  Vivoactive 4S besser, da sie optisch flacher erscheint.Nach den ersten Tagen zeigte sich jedoch, dass die Akkulaufzeit der Schwachpunkt der Uhr ist. Nur mit der normalen Pulsmessung, mit wenigen Smartphone Benachrichtigungen und keinen sportlichen Aktivitäten liegt der Verbrauch bei 20-25% am Tag. Kommen dann noch sportliche Aktivitäten hinzu, wird es noch enger. Eine Radfahrt von 100 Minuten mit Pulsmessung und GPS verbrauchte 19% Akkukapazität. Die Uhr ist also nur für Menschen, die wenige kurze sportliche Aktivitäten haben oder bereit sind die Uhr oft zu laden. Die Bedienung und Funktionalität in den Anwendungen ist über jeden Zweifel erhaben. Nur der Akku erfüllt den Anspruch leider nicht.Wir schicken Sie zurück und haben dafür die Fenix 6S Pro bestellt. Bei dieser zeigt sich, dass die Akkulaufzeit wirklich bei 7 Tagen liegt und die gleiche Radfahrt von 100 Minuten verbrauchte nur 10%. Der optisch vermeintliche Unterschied in der Dicke beläuft sich in der Realität nur auf ein paar Millimeter und das gleiche Design in Kupfer/Weiß ist auch erhältlich. Mit der Fenix 6S Pro muss man sich also nicht vor jeder spontanen längeren sportlichen Aktivität noch schnell ein Ladekabel suchen, nur um nicht unterwegs eine leere Uhr zu haben.', ""The watch wasn't in the Garmin box"", 'Super light - don’t even notice I’m wearing it - easy to use', 'Parts of the software and features stopped working after 3 weeks of use.Currently trying yo get garmin to fix.', 'Love my garmin vivoactive.

Und ich brauche auch kein GPS. Aber der Akku lädt sensationell schnell. Ich hänge sie morgens vor dem Duschen ans Ladekabel, mache mich fertig und eine knappe Stunde später ist sie von 7% auf 95% geladen. Das stört mich also gar nicht.Die Musikfunktion funktioniert ebenfalls super, meine Bluetooth-Kopfhörer werden sofort erkannt und die Übertragung klappt einfach. Das Fitnesstracking beispielsweise beim Spinning funktioniert einwandfrei und sie ist kompatibel mit meinem Polar-Herzfrequenzsensor (sogar besser als meine Polar-Uhr).Auch optisch finde ich die Uhr einfach hübsch. Sie hat auch für mein Handgelenk genau die richtige Größe, ohne wuchtig zu wirken.Fazit: Für mich einfach die richtige Uhr. Ein größerer oder leistungsfähigerer Akku würde die Uhr auch wieder größer machen und für meine Zwecke reicht der Akku aus, auch und nicht zuletzt aufgrund der Tatsache, dass die Ladezeit für mich echt in Ordnung ist.Ich war durch die teils sehr negativen Rezensionen stark verunsichert und bin froh, dass ich es einfach ausprobiert habe.', ""VERY bad quality... Couldn't read even on screen .."", 'Present for wife.Looks great.Ideal for petite wrists.Great running watch', 'Brilliant watch and looks good too!', 'Very happy with this Garmin watch', 'El diseño es lo que mas me gusta.Es el segundo artículo de Garmin que tengo. El primero me dejó decepcionada pero entendí que era porque yo necesitaba prestaciones que una pulsera de actividad no me da (Pay, música, avisos...)Estoy satisfecha con su diseño y precisión, las aplicaciones que ofrece y en general podría incluso recomendar.No obstante, para un reloj que cuesta casi 300 euros, creo que la calidad de la pantalla y color no son nada adecuados. No tiene brillo.... Me gustaría ver un color de la calidad de un pilar, Xiaomi, Fitbit.... Vamos, que cualquier marca tiene una pantalla con más luz. En el anuncio esto no se aprecia. Es engañoso incluso porque las imágenes prestan a creer que ver el reloj es como ver una pantalla de móvil que no es el caso. Apenas tiene color y el que tienes muy apagado. Es posible que aún sabiéndolo, lo hubiera comprado, pero no sé debe de engañar con algo así. Os voy a mostrar una foto con el brillo máximo para que lo veáis.Echo en falta que tome el pulso. También que la aplicación explique para que sirven muchos de los parámetros que sí registra (oxígeno, nivel de estrés, etc). O sea, que hay mucha información que no se interpretar y llevo años con relojes deportivos. Quería este más completo pero no es un ""Wow"".La aplicación ""pay"" funciona, pero la contraseña la pide una vez y luego puedes usarlo todo el día sin que vuelva a pedir el pin. Esto es un riesgo muy grande en caso de perdida o robo.La batería, si eres una persona activa, dura 3 días como mucho. En reposo dura mucho más, pero es un reloj deportivo. Debería de tener más duración.En resumen, relación calidad precio.....

Sie sieht sehr edel aus, insbesondere an einem schmaleren Frauen Handgelenk. Die Bedienung ist sehr leicht und funktioniert einwandfrei.Ich nutze sie täglich für sportliche Aktivitäten (Laufbandtraining und Krafttraining). Das macht sich natürlich am Akku bemerkbar. Alle 3 Tage spätestens muss geladen werden (und das ohne GPS Nutzung!). Finde ich persönlich etwas ungewohnt, aber ist nicht weiter störend soweit man sich erstmal dran gewöhnt hat.Nach drei Wochen intensiver Nutzung kann ich folgende Feedbacks geben:- Tracken von Aktivitäten klappt einwandfrei; auch Verbindung und Erkennung mit dem Brustgurt problemlos. Beim Krafttraining können Pausenzeiten getrackt werden, während dessen der Puls angezeigt wird. Sätze und Wiederholungen werden getrackt (stimmt aber nicht immer - ist mir persönlich aber unwichtig). Beim Cardio/Laufband Training wird der Puls und die Pace angezeigt. Die Distanz stimmt nicht immer (ohne GPS!). Insgesamt sehr gut um Aktivitäten zu tracken.- Schritte: erschienen mir bisher immer logisch und recht genau. Gestern hatte ich leider den Fall, dass für gleiche Strecke, die sonst etwa 7000 Schritte war (exakt die selbe) nur 4000 Schritte gezählt wurden. Auch die Aktivitätskalorien hingen fest bei 400, egal wie aktiv ich den restlichen tag noch war. Schritte wurden dann weiter gezählt, waren bei 12000. Beim nächsten Mal auf die Uhr schauen waren sie wieder bei 9000 und haben gar nicht mehr gezählt. Sehr unschön ! Habe dann ein Software Update installiert und die Uhr aus- und wieder an geschaltet. Seitdem funktioniert es erstmal wieder, bin aber gespannt ob der Fehler nochmal auftritt. Nach drei Wochen Nutzung natürlich sehr schade und enttäuschend (Schritte waren weg, hätten an dem Tag bei knapp 20000 sein müssen).- Kalorienangaben: Sind natürlich nur Richtwerte und Schätzungen und sollten niemals zu genau genommen werden. Dennoch zeigt die Uhr einen viel zu geringen Wert an bei mir (Aktivitätskalorien). Das ist für mich persönlich aber vernachlässigbar (wie gesagt, nur ein Richtwert).- Schlaf: Leider ein Manko, das bisher jede Garmin Uhr hatte bei mir (habe jetzt die 4. Uhr von der Marke). Ich liege die halbe Nacht wach und kann nicht schlafen (3 Stunden Wachzeit) und die Uhr erkennt das ALLES als Schlaf. Stimmt also überhaupt nicht überein. Und die Nächte, wo ich gefühlt tief wie ein Baby geschlafen habe: Kaum Tiefschlaf, nur leichter Schlaf. Sehr schade !!Alles in allem eine solide Uhr, die allerdings nicht allzu genau hin kommt in vielen Messungen. Dennoch ein nettes Spielzeug. Man kann zB auch seinen Zyklus tracken (was leider auch nicht so ganz funktioniert; die Uhr sagt , heute ist Tag 1 deiner Periode und man kann es zwar ausstellen, sofern sie nicht an genau diesem Tag kam, aber es springt immer wieder zurück), Flüssigkeitsaufnahme eingeben (nettes Tool) und seinen Stresswert anschauen.2 Sterne Abzug wegen Schlaf Ungenauigkeit und dem Hänger mit den Schritten gestern, sowie die kontant zu niedrigen Aktiv Kalorien und dem schnellen Akkuverbrauch.', ""Consegna eccezionale da parte di Amazon, tuttavia l'orologio è bello ma per funzionare con Iphone ha bisogno di molta applicazione e dell'aiuto del centro assistenza GArmin, l'ho dovuto resettare piu e piu volte e spero che adesso tutto funzioni, Garmin scrive sul suo sito che possono esservi problemi, ma questi sono oltre ogni immaginazione, bravi anche i ragazzi dell'assistenza Garmin.

Ich bin recht sportlich (Tennis, reiten, joggen, Yoga, Bauch-Beine-Po) und habe Dank der Uhr mich beim Joggen sehr verbessert (über den Winter 5-km Trainingsplan befolgt). Joggen war bisher für mich ein Ausgleich zu den anderen Sportarten, aber nun hab ich tatsächlich Spaß daran und schaffe auch 1mal die Woche locker 10 km am Stück.Was mir sehr gut gefällt:+ Musik hören über die Uhr -> endlich kein Mitschleppen des Smartphones beim Joggen+ Kann Trainingspläne fürs Reiten erstellen (über Sportart Radfahren), d.h. Uhr vibriert nach eingestellter Zeit, damit ich weiß, wann ich nach dem Schritt mit der Lösungsphase anfangen kann und mit der Arbeitsphase wieder durch sein sollte + kann mir Notizen machen/ Ziele des Trainings vermerken (gerade beim Reiten mehrere Pferde nützlich)+ Akku ist schnell geladen (wenn ich vor dem Joggen merke, dass ich nur noch 17% habe, hänge ich die Uhr 10 Minuten ans Ladegerät und es reicht auf jeden Fall für 1 Stunde joggen mit Musik und GPS)+ Akku hält bei mir 5 Tage trotz täglich getracktem Sport, allerdings mit ein paar Einstellungen wie Displaysperre, Ausschalten von diversen für mich unnötige BenachrichtigungenWas mir negativ auffiel:- wenn ich 2 eigen erstellte Trainingspläne für den gleichen Tag eingeplant habe, kommt beim Starten die Uhr manchmal durcheinander, d.h. ich wähle Training A aus und es startet aber mit B- Notfallanruf funktioniert nicht. Hatte 2 ordentliche Stürze mit dem Mountainbike, aber Notruf ging nicht los, obwohl mein Smartphone in unmittelbarer Nähe war. Einmal wollte der Notruf los gehen als ich mit dem MTB einen steileren Berg runter fuhr, allerdings nicht stürzte. Also unterm Strich funktioniert diese Funktion leider nicht.- Reiten muss man über Radfahren einstellen, ansonsten zählt es die Schritte mit. Gibt zwar eine App für Horsemanship, aber die war für mich nicht nützlich. Für mich sind die eigen erstelle Trainingspläne wichtig.- Musik Playlist muss meistens nach Software-Updates erneut heruntergeladen werden. Da es nur umständlich über Hotspot funktioniert und man die fehlende Playlist meistens erst merkt, wenn man los laufen will, ist nervig.Im November 2020 hab ich mir die Uhr zugelegt. Durch einen Fahrradsturz auf den Asphalt ging mir nun das Uhrenglas in viele kleine Einzelteile zu Bruch (Foto). Zum Glück hatte ich die Uhr versichert und die Abwicklung war nun unkompliziert (Gutschein für eine neue Uhr). Ich habe nun die Vivoactive 4s mit der Venu 2s online verglichen, aber ich glaube, ich werde wieder die Vivoactive 4s nehmen. Denn ich sehe tatsächlich in dem alten Display mehr Vorteile, wie z.B. display always on bei Vivoactive 4s, sowie Lesbarkeit im Sonnenlicht.  Von den Funktionen her sehe ich bei der venu 2s kaum Vorteile. HIIT gibt es als Traininsplan auch bei der Vivoactive 4s, allerdings nicht als einstellbare Sportart (aber brauch ich die? Würde Cardio oder Pilates einstellen). Zum Schlafen zieh ich generell die Uhr aus, daher ist die bessere Schlafanalyse für mich nicht interessant.', 'Esperaba la pantalla más grande ! Pero al usarlo me enamore ! Estaba acostumbrada al Apple Watch y me costo un poco de trabajo adaptarme a las funciones de este reloj, pero una vez que le agarras el modo es fantástico. Lo que más me gusta es el diseño y que me mide la calidad del sueño y cuánto tiempo estás en sueño REM, profundo o ligero. Lo recomiendo', 'Ich habe nun diese Uhr über längerer Zeit hin getestet und muss leider sagen, dass das Preisleistungsverhältnis absolut nicht ok ist.Mit der Akkulaufzeit habe ich keine Probleme,  aber allerdings mit der Ungenauigkeit was die verschiedenen Workouts betrifft.So mache ich beispielsweise 10 liegestütze und tatsächlich gezählt werden nur 4, das gleiche mit chruches und vielen weiteren Übungen.  Und ja, die Übungen werden korrekt ausgeführt,  daran liegt es 100 prozentig nicht.Ebenso hat die Uhr auch Probleme mit den Kalorienverbrauch.  Ein gemütlicher Spaziergang von 15 Minuten zum Beispiel zeigt mir einen Kalorienverbrauch von 70 an, 40 Minuten joggen mit einen pace von 5,47 einen Verbrauch von 145 Kalorien.  Das ist lachhaft. Und das ganze kam nicht nur einmal vor.Witzig ist auch, wenn man beispielsweise 10 Kilometer gejoggt ist, und man ruht sich danach aus, dauert es nicht lange bis einen die Uhr daran erinnert,  das es für eine Aktivität Zeit wird.Dann letztens der total Ausfall von der garmin Conectapp,  welcher Tage gedauert hat.Ich habe lange Zeit einen günstigen Fitnesstracker benutzt und wollte mir etwas gutes gönnen und habe mir diese Uhr angeschafft und muss sagen, ich bin maßlos enttäuscht. Benutze die Uhr  jetzt weiter, aber wenn sie kaputt ist, werde ich mir nie wieder eine garmin holen. Steht wirklich zu keinen Verhältniss zueinander!', 'Also, die Uhr ist so ziemlich das Schlechteste was ich erlebt habe. Habe sie meiner Frau geschenkt weil ich mit meiner Fenix 5 sehr zufrieden bin.Um es kurz zu machen. Optisch top, Verarbeitung und haptik sind klasse.Der Rest geht garnicht. Uhrzeit verstellt sich permanent von allein, Bluetooth funktioniert nicht, Verbindung mit dem iPhone ist eine Katastrophe. Man muss täglich die Uhr neu starten damit sie sich verbindet oder die uhr komplett aus der App löschen. Eine Farce für echt viel Geld.Jetzt werd ich mich mit dem Support in Verbindung setzten damit dieser Haufen Mist ans laufen kommt.', ""Ho preso il garmin vivoactive 4 perché volevo uno schermo touch come sostituto del mio garmin 645 music, purtroppo e'stata una gran delusione, visivamente e' molto bello, per il resto un disastro, il battito cardiaco si interrompe continuamente, anche per diverse ore, di conseguenza anche tutti gli altri sensori non funzionavano! Ho chiesto sostituzione, ma entrambi i dispositivi mi hanno presentato gli stessi problemi! Ho chiamato più volte l'assistenza garmin, ma non sono stati in grado di darmi una spiegazione esaustiva, se non farmi ripristinare piu volte il dispositivo! A malincuore ho chiesto rimborso. Assistenza Amazon sempre perfetta!"", 'Cuando pagas 240 € por un reloj esperas que sea duradero y que resista un simple roce con una mesa de cristal.Nueve, sí, nueve días han pasado desde que le regalé el reloj a mi novia hasta que se ha rayado por un roce leve con una mesa de cristal.El Gorilla Glass de este reloj me parece de chiste.¿Qué será lo próximo? ¿Sacar el reloj de la caja y que se raye al tocarlo con la uña del dedo?Es de risa el tema de las pantallas de móviles y relojes...La batería no hemos podido confirmar si dura poco o mucho.El software y las aplicaciones del reloj parecen correctas.No lo ha usado suficiente como para valorar otras cosas.', 'Die Uhr hat von Anfang an Spaß gemacht. Wie gewohnt ist die Qualität von Garmin einfach super. Die Uhr wirkt sehr wertig, ist gut verabeitet und bietet sehr viele Möglichkeiten sie den persönlichen Bedürfnissen anzupasssen. Aufgrund der vielen Möglichkeiten musste ich mir ein paar Anleitungen oder youtube Videos anschauen aber die grundsätzliche Bedienung ist intuitiv zu erlernen. Mittlerweile habe ich sie so angepasst wie ich es haben wollte. Ich zeichne meine Aktivitäten auf und sollte mal etwas passieren, wird mein Notfallkontakt benachrichtigt. Das Display sieht sehr stylisch aus und da ich zu wenig trinke, lasse ich die Uhr aufzeichnen wie viel ich den Tag über getrunken habe. Nachrichten und Anrufe werden zuverlässig angezeigt. Ich bin rundum zufrieden.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Eigentlich ist sie eine tolle Uhr,  ABERIch habe 1 vivoactive 3 und 2 vivoactive 4s bestellt und alle 3 Uhren haben ein wirklich großes  Problem!!!!!! Siehe Kurzes Video. Ich habe mit garmin versucht das Problem zu lösen. ABER man kann  KEINEN  telefonischen Kontakt aufnehmen. Ich bin vom Amazon Kundendienst wirklich total unterstützt worden, konnte die Uhren zurück geben, immer in der Hoffnung, dass es nur eine defekte Uhr sei. ABER DAS IS LEIDER NICHT SO!!!!Ich habe den Touchscreen gesperrt, sodass er eigentlich nur dann das ausführt, was durch Berührung des Touchscreens beabsichtigt wird, ausführt. ABER DAS IST NICHT SO!!!!Wenn der Ärmel einer Jacke den Touchscreen berührt, dann beginnen sich mindestens 2 verschiedene Ansichten, z. B. Das Zifferblatt und die Anzeige der Menge der E-Mails und sonstigen Benachrichtigungen schnell abwechselnd hin und her zu bewegen. Das ich die Vibration eingeschaltet habe, spüre ich diese in dem beschriebenen Fall natürlich auch! ABER DAS GRÖßTE PROBLEM IST, DASS DER AKKU SCHNELL LEER IST!!!Ansonsten finde ich die Uhr schön, sportlich elegant, sie kann extrem viel und die schnell wechsel Armbänder finde ich super!', 'Die Uhr an sich ist super. Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit den Funktionen, der Verbindung zum Handy und den umfangreichen Möglichkeiten. Hab bisher nichts zu bemängeln.Ein Stern Abzug für das Silikon-Armband, von dem ich nicht verstehe, wieso das immer noch verwendet wird. Selbstverständlich habe ich, wie alle in meiner Familie und in meinem Freundeskreis irgendwann, innerhalb kürzester Zeit eine heftige allergische Reaktion auf dieses Armband bekommen (Lieferung Donnerstag, juckender, roter Ausschlag Dienstag früh...) Jetzt muss ich warten, bis das neue Armband aus Leder da ist. Das hat dann natürlich eine silberne Schnalle und einen anderen Weißton, was irgendwie schade ist. :/', 'Nur wenige Monate nach dem Kauf kaputt, die Uhr läd nicht mehr. Sie läd schon wenn man alles ganz fest zusammenpresst, aber wer will schon 30 min am Ladegerät sitzen. Der nette Support hat bis heute keine Rückantwort dazu wann ein Update kommt in dem die Pool m unter 13 m verstellbar sind, ist ja nicht jeder bill Gates. Sprich 9m sind nicht drin, es berechnet die Strecke falsch uvm. Das Armband in weiß sammelt gut Schmutz auf, es ist sehr griffig, was in der Farbe für Schmutz ein Magnet ist, Touch ist in der Bedienung eine Zumutung, wenn man ein sportsysmbol tippt, poppt oft ein anderes daneben auf, die Finger zu groß oder Bildschirm zu klein, lieber wieder eine mit Knöpfen. Die war besser, trinkeinträge sind was für Kinder, Spielerei', 'A primera vista está todo correcto y las funcionalidades superan con creces lo esperado. Soy usuario de otro reloj Garmin, en concreto el Fenix 3HR, y sólo decir que me ha decepcionado enormemente la duración de la batería, tras unas actualizaciones de software, se ha mejorado bastante, pero no llega a 10 días ni de lejos, llegamos a 5 sin uso de aplicaciones deportivas ni GPS.Respecto a la conectividad, sigue existiendo grandes problemas con los dispositivos HUAWEI, con los que parece que tiene firmado el divorcio, ya que se desconecta con frecuencia del móvil y pocas veces saltan los avisos en pantalla del reloj sobre los que llegan al móvilPor lo demás, contento con él, mi mujer está muy contenta', 'Eigentlich eine sehr schöne Fitnessuhr. Was mich allerdings extrem stört, ist die Tatsache, dass die Uhr ausschließlich mit der Kalorien-App MyFitnessPal kommuniziert... und auch nur dann, wenn man die Vollversion für 50,-€/Jahr erwirbt. Zum Einen finde ich, es gibt hier wesentlich bessere Apps (ist aber Geschmackssache) zum Anderen ist diese Kombi bei dem teuren Kaufpreis schlichtweg nicht in Ordnung. Daher keine Kaufempfehlung', 'Ich habe stundenlang nach einer neuen SmartWatch gesucht. Viele Uhren wären beinahe in meinem Einkaufswagen gelandet, aber meist schreckte irgendein Nachteil ab.Mit der vivoactive 4S bin ich aber sehr zufrieden.Der Akku hält wirklich sehr lange. Ich lade sie je nach Aktivität ca. zweimal in der Woche auf. Sie ist auch sehr schnell aufgeladen, so dass die Uhr nach ca. 2h wieder einsatzbereit ist.Die Uhr trägt sich angenehm und hat vor allem für Sportfreunde zusammen mit der App recht viel Auswahl was Sportprogramme angeht.Man kann per App entweder selber das Design der Oberfläche erstellen oder lädt sich ein Design herunter. Man kann als Hintergrund zum Beispiel eigene Bilder einfügen. Das ist sehr schön.Die Bedienung ist nicht immer ganz intuitiv, aber wenn man einmal verstanden hat, wie es geht, dann ist es einfach.Wichtig für mich war neben der langen Akku-Laufzeit, dass mich die Uhr auch zuverlässig morgens weckt. Das funktioniert auch einwandfrei.Ich bin rundum mit der Uhr zufrieden. Nur zwei kleine Mankos stören....Man kann mit der Uhr selbst nicht telefonieren und das Tracking des Schlafs funktioniert überhaupt nicht. Sitzt man abends ruhig auf der Couch und schaut einen Film, wird dies als Tiefschlaf angezeigt. Da war meine Fitbit Charge 2 deutlich zuverlässiger. Wer also seinen Schlaf tracken möchte, sollte sich lieber eine andere Uhr suchen.', 'Grundsätzlich bin ich mit der Uhr und ihren Funktionen absolut zufrieden. Auch das Problem mit den Akkulaufzeiten kann ich so nicht bestätigen. Einzig die Stockwerkerkennung liegt bei mir fast immer völlig daneben. Wirklich indiskutabel ist allerdings der Umstand, dass ich nach nur 6 Tagen tragen der Uhr eine Allergie am Handgelenk entwickelt habe. Also ganz im Ernst das darf bei einer Uhr für 300,- € einfach nicht passieren - insbesondere da mir das noch nie passiert ist.Ich habe mir jetzt von einem anderen Hersteller zwei Ersatzarmbänder bestellt und hoffe, dass das Problem damit beseitigt ist, da ich die Uhr sonst mag und gerne weiter nutzen würde.Schon sehr traurig bei einem so renommierten Hersteller wie Garmin.', ""la consegna ha ritardato di 4 giorni ed è per questo che ho dovuto farmelo consegnare in un altra città.L'orologio esteticamente è molto carino, elegante e discreto, ma questi sono le uniche note positive.Ia dimensione del display è molto inferiore a quella che si percepisce in foto e la qualità non è degna di un Garmin. Per lo stesso prezzo meglio prendere il Huawei (solo che il quadrante è molto grande) e quello più piccolo non puoi rispondere alle chiamate. Ma Nemmeno con il Garmin potevi rispondere direttamente con l'orologio.  Dall'orologio in se, non puoi vedere granché ( il dettaglio del sonno, la stima giornaliera o settimanale ecc.) ma puoi vederlo solo dall'applicazione che per me non è assolutamente intuitiva.Per tutti questi motivi decido che non vale 250 euro spesi. Avrei potuto usarlo tutto il mese e poi renderlo ma non mi sembrava corretto dato che avevo già preso la mia decisione e che così facendo avrei sicuramente rovinato il quadrante e per rispetto di un futuro acquirente ho reso l'orologio dopo una settimana. Purtroppo il reso è arrivato al destinatario vuoto quindi non ho ricevuto il rimborso.  sono stata derubata e l'assistenza Amazon (quella che si occupa solo di questi problemi) mi ha veramente deluso, sono stata trattata malissimo senza poter avere un confronto con un essere umano.L'assistenza normale è sempre stata gentile e disponibile, mi ha consigliato, dato che i resi non sono assicurati, di andare a fare il reso direttamente alla posta. ( Così forse il rischio di furto da parte di ignoti è minore).Oppure forse conviene fare un video senza stacchi dove mettete l'orologio nel pacco e lo consegnate al corriere.Morale della favola Ho fatto denuncia di furto. Sono senza orologio e senza soldi. Mi spiace davvero molto per l'accaduto per me è stato un duro colpo perdere questi soldi e spero di poter risolvere il problema."", 'Habe die Uhr seit ungefähr einer Woche am Anfang ist alles super gewesen hat auch ohne Probleme funktioniert und seit 3 Tagen entlädt sie sich innerhalb von 1 1/2 Stunden. Ich habe die Uhr für 5 Minuten beobachtet und alle 1-2 Sekunden ist ein weiterer Prozent flöten gegangen zwischendurch. Und für diesen Preis eine ABSOLUTE FRECHHEIT!!!!', 'Habe die Uhr für meine Frau gekauft. Sie nutzt die Uhr sowohl im Alltag als auch zum Sport.Sieht super aus und die Verarbeitung ist klasse. Es gibt verschiedene Armbänder in verschiedenen Farben.Bedienung ist leicht und schnell verständlich.Lediglich die Sportprofilauswahl könnte etwas größer sein, so gibt es beispielsweise keine Kategorie ""Reiten"".Hierfür muss man sich eine andere App (kostenpflichtig) runterladen.Wer die Uhr für die üblichen Sportarten wie Laufen, Fahrrad fahren oder schwimmen nutzt ist mit der Uhr gut bedient.', 'Im Alltag kommt Bewegung oft zu kurz und schnell verliert man den Überblick wie viel oder wenig man sich doch wirklich bewegt hat. Seit ich diese Uhr benutze bin ich konsequenter und nehme mir bewusst Zeit für Aktivitäten. Damit hat sich meine Aktivität deutlich erhöht und meine Beschwerden sind verschwunden. Dei verschiedenen Einstellmöglichkeiten machen die Uhr besonders flexibel nutzbar. Für eine temporäre Einschätzung der O2-Sättigung oder die Schlaftiefe ist es gut möglich, sich einen Überblick über den allgemeinen Fitnesszustand oder Stresslevel zu verschaffen. Das muss nicht immer eingestellt werden. Und dadurch ist der individuellen Nutzung der Uhr fast keine Grenzegesetzt. Die Akkus halten je nach verwendeter Einstellungen fast eine Woche oder auch nur wenige Tage ( bei O-2-Sättigung z.b.). Von mir klare Kaufempfehlung', 'Ich habe mir die Garmin Vivoactive 4s aufgrund der sehr guten Produktbewertungen gekauft. Mir war es wichtig eine Uhr zu haben, die feminin modisch aussieht und zugleich ein zuverlässiger Begleiter für mein Training ist.In Punkto Design erhält die Uhr von mir gerne 5 Sterne. Sie ist nicht klobig und wirkt in weiß mit goldenem Rand feminin und stylisch. Es gibt acht unterschiedliche Displaydesigns - sowohl „analoge“ Ziffernblätter wie auch digitale Zeitanzeigen. Hier ist für jeden etwas dabei.Tragekomfort:Zunächst habe ich die Uhr auch Nachts getragen, um meinen Schlaf zu tracken. Daran habe ich nach einer gewissen Zeit den Spaß verloren. Hinzukam, dass es meiner Haut nicht gut tat das Kunststoffarmband rund um die Uhr zu tragen. Ein Lederarmband wäre hier sicherlich angenehmer. Beim „normalen“ Gebrauch im Alltag bleiben diese Probleme jedoch aus und die Uhr trägt sich sehr angenehm.Akku Leistung:Der Akku hält bei Dauer-Tageseinsatz etwa drei Tage. Ich bemühe jedoch die Uhr nachts auszuschalten und die Bluetooth-Funktion - sofern nicht benötigt - ausgeschaltet zu halten. Bei eingeschalteter Bluetooth-Funktion hält der Akku weniger lange.Garmin-App:Um die Uhr mit dem Handy zu koppeln und eine detaillierte Trainingsauswertung zu erhalten, muss die Garmin App installiert werden. Die Kopplung mit der App funktioniert problemlos. Die App ist übersichtlich gestaltet und Auswertung des Trainings ist detailliert und gut nachvollziehbar.Nun zum Thema Einsatz während des Trainings:Ich wollte in erster Linie eine Uhr haben, die meine Schritte zählt und mich während des Joggens begleitet. Hierfür erfüllt sie absolut ihren Zweck. Die Uhr lässt sich so einstellen, dass sie Aktivitäten wie gehen und joggen nach einer gewissen Zeit alleine startet. Sie misst zuverlässig meine Herzfrequenz und es lässt sich in der App hinterher die gelaufene Strecke nachvollziehen. Beim joggen fehlt mir ein wenig ein Warnsignal, wenn man einen gewissen Herzfrequenzbereich überschreitet. Dies wäre eine schöne Ergänzung.Nun zu meinen negativen Trainings-Erfahrungen mit der Uhr:Die Stockwerk-Zählung funktioniert nicht immer einwandfrei.  Häufig zeigt die Uhr erreichte Stockwerke-Ziele, ohne dass ich tatsächlich Stufen gegangen bin. Dies geschieht gelegentlich, wenn ich zu joggen beginne oder einen Aufzug nutze. Nicht ganz korrekt sind auch die Zählung der Wiederholungszahl beim Krafttraining sowie die Zählung der Bahnen beim Schwimmen. Ich habe hier den Eindruck, dass die Uhr  komplexere Bewegungsabläufe noch nicht richtig erkennt. Hier gibt es sicher noch Verbesserungsmöglichkeiten.', 'Sono fedele a Garmin da sempre. Ho acquistato Vivoactive 4s dopo che anche il mio secondo Forerunner 645 Music mi ha abbandonata. Provenendo io da un orologio molto ""tecnico"" per la corsa, ma meno ""smartwatch"" (il Forerunner non ha nemmeno il touchscreen) ho apprezzato molto questo modello, che unisce un\'ottima funzionalità negli sport ma è molto più comodo dell\'altro nella vita di tutti i giorni. Il touchscreen rende molto più semplice l\'utilizzo dell\'orologio e la connessione bluetooth con il telefono è stabile mentre il Forerunner si disconnetteva continuamente, non so se fosse un problema del mio o se sia normale. Al momento ho utilizzato Vivoactive 4s nell\'attività cardio e nella corsa, sempre abbinato alla fascia HRM Dual, e nel nuoto in piscina. Nella corsa ovviamente fornisce dati base e non avanzati come il Forerunner, ma per un amatore senza pretese sono più che sufficienti. Nel nuoto in piscina tende a sovrastimare leggermente il numero di vasche, ma nulla di tragico (circa il 5/10% in più rispetto alla distanza effettivamente percorsa). Nel nuoto rileva il battito cardiaco dal polso, ma vedendo il grafico mi pare più una stima che altro. La batteria dura tranquillamente una settimana utilizzato in modalità smartwatch + 4 sessioni di allenamento da un\'ora. Lo consiglio a chi cerca uno smartwatch esteticamente carino ma che sia anche un compagno di allenamento sufficientemente affidabile.', 'Ich habe von der Vivomove HR zur Vivoactive 4s gewechselt um mal ein paar mehr gadgets und Funktionen zu haben. Leider bin ich für den Preis nicht zufrieden. Die Displayqualität ist unteres Mittelmaß (vor allem für den Preis) und die vorinstallierten animieren Übungen (wie z.B. Yoga), die mich hauptsächlich zu dieser Uhr gebracht haben, bringen schon einen mittelmäßigen Sportler zum einschlafen. Sehr nett gedacht, aber leider noch schlecht umgesetzt.Für 60-80€ mehr gibt es die schicker anmutende Venu.Die Vivoactive 4s wirkt selbst an meinem kleinen Arm (1,58m-Frau) total klein und vor allem hoch und billig. Leider also nichts für mich.', 'He tenido todos los Vivoactive, con el 3 estaba muy contenta, pero para mujer sigue siendo grande y no queda bien a mi parecer , es por ello que al ver éste quise cambiarlo. La talla 4s queda estupenda, de tamaño es como un reloj normal, lo que implica que hay cosas que si te falla un poco la vista de cerca , te costará ver, como los resúmenes de las actividades, ahora el resumen es más chulo pero se ve muy pequeñito!**** He borrado mi anterior opinión sobre la batería puesto que lleva más días probándolo y con 30 minutos mínimo de ejercicio al día está consumiendo un 20% por día, un  poco más  si activas el pulsioxímetro, así que viene a ser la misma duración que el Vivoactive 3 o más... así que de momento no voy a quejarme que me gusta mucho !!', 'Das war die zweite Garmin, die ich nun ausprobiert habe. Bei dieser war ich anfangs eigentlich ganz zufrieden. Obwohl ich bei dem Preis erwartet hätte, dass das Display ein bisschen mehr nach 2021 aussieht und weniger wie das erste Farbdisplay beim Nokia.Die Einrichtung und Bedienung ist einfach. Toll finde ich die Streckenerkennung beim Laufen. Am Ende kann man die komplette Route mit allen Infos auf der App anschauen.Der Grund, warum ich sie zurückgeschickt habe ist der Kalorientracker. An einem ruhigen Sonntag, wo ich lediglich 1h spazieren und insgesamt 7800 Schritte gelaufen war, zeigte die Uhr am Ende des Tages einen Gesamtverbrauch von 2000kcal. Am Tag danach war ich arbeiten und danach laufen und hatte insgesamt 16000 Schritte gemacht. Da hatte ich am Ende des Tages nur einen Gesamtverbrauch von 1800kcal.Ich kann also von der Uhr ehrlich gesagt nur abraten.', 'Ich glaube ich habe ein ""Montagsprodukt"" erwischt. Ich kann die guten Rezensionen nicht bestätigen.Die Garmin zeichnet meine Schlafzeiten nicht wirklich korrekt auf. Wenn ich bereits eine halbe Stunde wach bin, zeigt sie später an, dass ich dann noch geschlafen habe. Das hat mein 30EUR Fitnesstracker mindestens genauso gut gemacht.Wenn ich spazieren gehe (in Hamburg auf dem plattesten Land), zeigt die Uhr an, dass ich über 100 Stockwerke gelaufen bin... Stimmt leider so gar nicht!Außerdem ist es an keinem Tag die Anzahl an Stockwerken runter und wieder rauf. Das sollte es aber sein, da ich an den meisten Tagen immer die selben Stockwerke rauf und runter gehe ....Ob die kcal bei den Übungen genau angezeigt werden, kann ich nicht beurteilen.', ""Il prodotto appena arrivato presentava un'anomalia legata al mal funzionamento della retroilluminazione, ma devo sottolineare che il servizio amazon relativo al reso è stato impeccabile. In 3 gg hanno gestito il tutto ritirando il vecchio e consegnando il nuovo, che risulta essere perfettamente funzionante, molto bello e funzionale. Lo consiglio, nella versione small soprattutto alle donne."", 'Auf der Suche nach einer Alternative für die Apple Watch meiner Frau sind wir auf diese hübsche Alternative gestoßen.Die Uhr kam schnell an.

Bereits beim Einschalten ist mir aufgefallen dass die Zeiger der analogen Uhr sehr pickelig waren. Schell hat sich bestätigt dass das Display insgesamt sehr schlecht ist. Niedriger Kontrast, blasse Farben, kein richtiges Schwarz in der Darstellung, Darrstellung grob/ Pixelig.Bei einer Uhr für fast 300 Euro ( dafür bekommt man auch eine Apple Watch oder Galaxy Watch) haben wir etwas anders erwartet, die Enttäuschung ist leider groß und die Uhr geht zurück...', ""Oddio ormai lo uso SEMPRE, sia con il vestiario sportivo, casual che elegante!Purtroppo mi sono infortunata poco dopo averlo preso e non corro più da qualche mese, riesco comunque a sfruttarlo tantissimo perchèmi serve per tracciare i km percorsi, i tempi delle varie attività eccUnica pecca sec me è l'impossibilità di mettere in pausa le attività, per questo dò 4stelle, nonchè per la risoluzione un pò bassa.Il design lo trovo molto fine nonchè femminile."", 'Eine wirklich sehr schöne und durchdachte Smartwatch, die fast keine Wünsche offen lässt. Das Einrichten der Uhr war einfach. App installiert und verbunden. Die einzelnen Funktionen zu nutzen gelingt am besten durch Learning by doing. Ich war erst skeptisch, ob die Uhr nicht doch zu wuchtig an meinem Handgelenk wirkt, da dieses ziemlich schmal ist. Aber die Größe ist super. Schade finde ich, dass die App Garmin Connect nur mit My Fitness Pal die Kalorien synchronisiert. Ich selber nutze Yazio, wo man zwar beide Apps verbinden kann, aber die Kalorien nicht übertragen werden. Alles andere funktioniert soweit ganz gut. Akkulaufzeit ist top. Ich würde die Watch empfehlen', 'Ich habe vorher eine Fitbit Versa und Charge 3 gehabt.  Beide hatten einen Wasserschaden nach dem Schwimmen. Daher habe ich eine wasserdichte Uhr gesucht und bin auf die Garmin Vivoactive 4s gestoßen.Ich bin von dieser SmartWatch begeistert. Der Akku hält ohne SmartWatch Modus 4 Tage. Das Aufzeichnen der Aktivitäten klappt super und sie ist auch wirklich wasserdicht.Die Handhabung der Uhr ist etwas knifflig und nicht intuitiv, aber mit der Zeit weiß man, wo alles istPositiv:+ wasserdicht+ leicht+ schönes Design+ integrierte Fitnessübungen+ schnelles Starten zum Aufzeichnen der ÜbungenNegativ:- teuer- kniffelige Menüführung', 'Mein Lebensstil ist grundsätzlich aktiver geworden. Mit alten (günstigeren) Uhr, die ich vorher benutzt habe, hat das alles nicht so viel Spaß gemacht. Die mehr Funktionen sind auch noch einfach zu bedienen.Ohne viel Aufwand hat man die gesamte Analyse der Strecke.Am Ende der Laufstrecke oder Workouts speichert die Uhr die Daten gleich auf Handy.Da ich immer zuwenig trinke, erinnert mich die Uhr jetzt regelmäßig und ich freue mich der Uhr ein weiteres Glas Wasser hinzuzufügen.Trotz hartem Einsatz der Uhr am Handgelenk sind keine Kratzspuren oder Verschleißerscheinungen festzustellen.Der Akku hält wie versprochen über eine Woche und ist auch ratz fatz aufgeladen.War für mich eine sehr gute Entscheidung mir das von meiner Familie schenken zu lassen! ;-)', ""Très belle montre.

Éste es comodo, fácil de usar y sincronizar, tiene una infinidad de funciones y es super preciso.Lo que más me gusta son los planes de entreno; eliges un objetivo (en mi caso de carrera) y te monta un plan de entrenamiento. Te dice cuantos dias tienes que entrenar por semana, la duración de la carrera, la intensidad de cada intervalo y lo va actualizando semanalmente en función de cómo vas para que logres conseguir tu objetivo. Añade artículos super interesantes, consejos para mejorar la técnica. Es como un entrenador personal robot.

La pantalla se ve de maravilla, porque se adapta a la luz en todo momento.Estéticamente es precioso tanto si vas arreglada, cómo si vas de entreno.La música con los Airpods Pro se conectan con el sistema Bluetooth, a pesar de ser otra tecnología.En mi caso, el sistema de pago Garmin pay no es compatible con mi banco ING DIRECT, es una pena.En resumen, despues de un Forunner 620, estoy más que satisfecha.', 'Schöne Uhr, aber habe sie nach zwei Wochen wieder zurückgegeben.

I did not even try to play music but assume this would bring down battery life to minutes...Sending this one back and hope a replacement will work better, although I am disappointed with Garmin on bringing out a product that is by far worse than any of its predecessors.

Inicialmente pode não ser muito intuitivo mas deve-se sobretudo ao facto de ter apenas dois botões e ecrã Touch e muitas funcionalidades diferentes. Além de todas as capacidades é também um relógio bonito ideal para usar no dia a dia.

The physical appearance is a very pleasant surprise! It looks very classy with the black metal band and rose gold trim.

It looks like a typical watch but you can customize what watch face (analog, digital, with a theme etc) you like and easily change it with your mood, outfit or season. It's super easy to navigate and figure out, and you can customize the type of notifications you want to receive on your phone (ex: I opted to not know when I get social media notifications but wanted emails and texts). Convinient when doing things since you can take a phone call through the watch and I find people hear me better than being on my phone's speaker. You can also pause music or tv shows that you play through your phone. Easy to sink up to my gallaxy (my partner has an iphone and also had no issue). Battery lasts a full day for me and I check it frequently, get many notifications and have the typically light settings. I get complements on it all the time. I chose the black band and rose gold but notice it also has a light silver circle on the inside which really allows me to wear it with any type of jewelry or outfit making it very easy to coordinate with anything. Definitely worth it. The watch is super secure, comfortable, and you can tell is a good quality watch. The size gets getting used to and a couple tries of adjusting the band to find the right fit for my wrist, but is actually the perfect accent piece, fits comfortably and looks super nice, a lot nicer than the apple ones I think."", 'This is my first ever smart watch and I absolutely adore it already. Fast, smart and easy to use. So many ways to use just one little watch on your wrist! The strap that comes with it is a little confusing to adjust. But no worries, you have to be 10% smarter than the strap.', ""This watch looks beautiful, much more like a classic wristwatch than a piece of technology, but it's packed with features - this is for a true techie, not someone looking for a fitness tracker only.I think it will take a while to figure out everything this watch can do because it's basically a computer on your wrist. The face of the watch is big enough that I could even type out a quick message in a pinch. Integrates easily with gmail/other google apps.Love the many options for watch faces and the power saving features are great. Strap is comfortable and pretty easy to adjust once you figure it out (not an intuitive design I will say - but a quick google solved this).  I will say this is a large watch, not dainty - don't think I would want to sleep with this on (which is a shame since it can track sleep). Wish there was a smaller/lighter womens version.The screen is really bright and clear, arguably clearer than my several year old iPhone. If you don't like touchscreens or have issues with them, there are some buttons on the side that control some of the functionality which is nice so you're not totally reliant on the touchscreen.Also - can't believe this is water proof. It looks way to fancy to take anywhere near the pool or the beach, but I still love that feature for accidentally hopping in the shower (or being pushed into a pool?) The speaker is also surprisingly loud and clear - I don't jog willingly, but I imagine being able to control music from your wrist is convenient.Overall - if you want primarily a fitness tracker, this is overkill. If you want a beautiful watch that can also do 75% of what your smartphone can do, go for it!"", 'Like other buyers, I found the watch got scratched up quickly - after less than a week of normal wear. Also, despite deleting apps and changing settings, the watch would not stop doing background heart rate checks, so my battery would last about half a day. Sending it back. Very disappointed, as I liked the GPS for tracking outdoor exercise and syncing with Google Fit as well as the NFC payments with Google Pay. But this technology is not yet what it needs to be.', 'I\'ll try to attach as many photos as I can, but I wanted to start by saying that I\'ve been reading countless reviews about the Fossil Gen 5\'s for literal weeks now via Amazon and Fossil\'s website, and the most frequent issues I saw people write about were the speaker and the battery. I\'m glad I caught the $199 sale- and that there were reviews about the recently improved updates concerning these two issues, because that is what pushed me to move forward with purchasing, and I couldn\'t be happier with that decision!!!Styling:First and foremost, the Gen 5 Julianna is STYLISH! I love the mesh band, which actually catches the light like a diamond would, giving off a glittery effect (still a learning curve on how to adjust it but YouTube came through,) and the rose gold face in contrast with the black body and band gives a nice balance between sleek and sporty. I did purchase a glass screen protector and applied that almost immediately, but it doesn\'t interfere with responsiveness or visibility at all (glad I bought it too because I accidentally dropped the watch like 30 mins after un-boxing it...) Not a scratch after dropping onto my wooden floors, to my relief! There are a variety of watchfaces via the phone and WearOs app, and I discovered last night that they are customizable as well! (See photos.) Just link your FB or IG to upload a pic and customize the colors for the font, etc., and then you can save it to the watch!Speaker:The speaker is perfect clear and the volume for ringtones, general media/calls etc. is adjustable. It also has ""do not disturb,"" ""Airplane Mode,"" and ""Theatre Mode"" features. I\'m guessing the most recent update helped to improve the speaker clarity issue that many others complained about in the past; I currently have my volume at the halfway mark and it is certainly loud enough.Display:The display has an Automatic brightness setting and it does adjust for direct sunlight as well. As is the case with most phones, depending on exposure you may need to brighten it up using the ""Sunlight Boost"" in the display settings. I was at a food truck today just after noon with a cloudless sky and had no issues seeing, especially with the added Boost.Battery:The notorious battery issue. What I discovered rather quickly was that the battery will indeed wear down rapidly during the first few hours of use  unless it is fully charged, and will continue to do so if you have every single feature running all day. I HIGHLY recommend looking at the Battery settings on the watch itself, since there are different performance modes to choose from (heavy daily use with everything running constantly, semi-reduced use, a custom use mode (which is what I chose,) and a literal ""Time Only"" mode, which states it can power the watch for weeks. My specific recommendations to conserving battery: adjust the heart rate monitoring so it isn\'t checking every single minute unless you\'re actively working out (mine is every 30 mins,) disable some of your notifications via the WearOs app from any phone apps you don\'t need to be aware of urgently (like Insta, Audible, Google Drive, any games, etc.,) limit the movement ""Gestures"" to only one mode of your choosing (I\'m only doing tap to wake since I\'m moving my hands constantly all day,) turn on NFC only when at checkout, connect to your WiFi, and choose a watchface without a secondhand. With doing all of these things, I have been able to use my watch, while still checking it and playing with it throughout the day today, without needing to charge it once. I took it off of the charger around 0800 this morning on my way to work, and as of now (19:22-ish,) I have 52% battery life. That includes texting throughout the day, setting reminders, and organizing my apps. If you\'re having issues, I\'d recommend checking out the WearOs app to see what is eating up your battery the most; it will list the functions in order from most-usage to the least usage. (See screenshot for reference.)Final thoughts/misc. info:The only other thing I can think of right now is that it will charge very quickly if you lay it down onto the charger (as opposed to charging the watch while on it\'s side.) The face is not humongous on my skinny wrist, and the watch is noticeable but not heavy by any means. Oh! There is also an app you can download called Noonlight which I recommend; you can set it up to have 911 or whoever sent to your location if you\'re feeling like you\'re in danger by either setting a timer that you have to disable at any time limit that you choose and if you don\'t disable by that time then they call to check on you/send help, OR, you can just go straight to ""Trigger Alarm"" and it starts then.Also, steps and heart rate also feel pretty accurate in comparison with previous my data from my Fitbit, there are easily loggable workouts and a nice breathing exercise integrated as well.Overall I think the Gen 5 made for a great birthday gift to myself and as a self-proclaimed ""tech-junkie"" I have absolutely no regrets!! If you\'re on the fence, add it to the cart and go live your best (and most convenient) life!!', ""I have had 1 other fossil smartwatch that I used for some time and then got rid of it (I ordered a men's watch on accident and it was HEAVY). I have had the Samsung galaxy watch for the past year, and didn't like that it wasn't fully customizable and ill explain. You cant customize the galaxy watch with a picture AND your steps or stats. I believe you can with 3rd party apps, but I could never figure them out. With fossil smart watches you can! I chose this watch because it was Gen 5 and as close to all black as I could get with the Gen 5 watches. It is perfect! Screen is big enough to easily see what is going on, and it doesn't feel heavy. Halfway through the day I am at 76% battery left, and I typically charge my watches every night. 4 stars for battery life because the galaxy watch I can go 2 full days on 1 charge. Still a 5 star watch in my eyes because it is literally a smart watch. More is done from the watch than the Google OS app. Fossil wins vs. Samsung in my book."", ""This watch has been great so far. Bought light pink one for myself and black one for my boyfriend and we love it. I love the fitness features, all the apps and the breath app! It's lightweight. Once I figured everything out I was hooked. Had a little bit of a learning curve coming from the Gear S2 but this still a big improvement because it's lighter and smarter however the battery doesn't last as long. I bought an extra charger for work, it is necessary to get a second charger. I have to charge it daily and sometimes more if I plan to track workouts or sleep track with it but with two chargers it is manageable. Eventually I'll probably get a second watch so I can alternate if money permits. I mostly use it as a timer and to see notifications from my phone. It's good because I can go about my day without constantly needing my phone. It's really good to have at work so I can stay focused. I prefer the black waterproof watchband that I gave my bf to the light pink suede like one I got for myself. That one's easier to clean, you can keep it on when you wash your hands and will last and look good for a lot longer.As for the pale pink one, noticed after one week it's starting to take on some dark tinge on the edges, even though I've been careful to remove it when watching my hands and face.My last watch was not waterproof but had a silicone wrist band so I'm used to being careful but not needing to be overly careful, I was able to keep on even when washing my hands. Only took it off to shower or wash my face.I will have to buy another watch band and only use the light pink on sparingly or on special occasions. I was able to clean it with a damp sponge, mixed a little laundry detergent with water and patted then patted dry, which cleaned it, but I noticed some ripples as if the glue underneath was not happy about getting wet, even just a little damp. Once it dried I was able to hold the ripples down and they went away. It did the trick but I wouldn't reccomend doing that often.I want to live my life and not worry about my watch every second so I'm buying an alternative band right away.Other than that it's a good watch, looks elegant and sleek. I've found some bands on Amazon that look good."", ""I purchased this watch based on the style and reviews and was surprised by my experience with the watch. I was unable to open or see text on the watch. It would say I had a notification and when I went to open it the notification would clear. The battery life is TERRIBLE!! I took it off the charger at 100% at 8:00am, by 10:15am the watch was completely dead and powered off. I then charged it again, took it off the charger at 100% and within 1 minute battery life had died down to 96% and I wasn't even using it! I've adjusted all the settings and brightness but nothing worked. Possibly mine was defected and it really is a good watch but I won't waste my time or money purchasing a new one."", ""Overall this watch is fantastic. I've been wearing for about 3 months now. Here are my major things.Battery life: it gets better as time goes on! I read some reviews about terrible battery life, and when I first used it out if package, that was true. For the first week or two, it drained quickly (sometimes within hours) from updates and such. Now I can wear it all day long and end the day at about 25-45%. This is with bluetooth on, NFC on, always-on-display, plus with gestures turned on. Things that can kill the battery: if I'm getting nonstop texts (like a group chat) or if I'm flipping my wrist a lot accidentally (since I have gestures on). I typically will just turn on do not disturb mode on my watch if too many texts or will lock the screen if I'm repeatedly flipping my wrist (or could turn off gestures).Convenience: simply having the time on my wrist has been more convenient than imaginable. On top of that, being able to quickly see (or respond to) a text is amazing. I used to pull out my phone and click click click...swipe...type...click- and go through that whole rigmarole. Not anymore! I also have my quick button set for a timer which I use daily and have weather displayed right on the watch face. It's all right there without fussing with my phone and it's wonderful.Design: it's gorgeous. I was scared it would look too large on my *tiny* wrist, but the round face makes it not too in-your-face. I bought a little screen protector which has been great and the metal has been surprisingly tough. I do occassionally knock it against things and so far, no real damage. The metal mesh band is by far my favorite. It's easy to get on and off. I bought a regular watch band type strap but it doesn't fit near as well as the mesh.Drawbacks: I sometimes wish I could use the phone app to adjust any of the settings of the watch, but it's limited to a very select few which can be annoying to fiddle with on the watch's small screen.My biggest catch so far, I can't make or answer calls on my watch like I was sure that I could. It was one of the reasons I had purchased this watch in particular to begin with. When a call comes in, if I hit answer on my watch, it says to continue call on my phone. Trying to get that figured out still!Overall, it's been a huge improvement in convenience and efficiency for me."", ""After using only Fitbit products since 2014, I was impressed by how smart this watch is.  It has a lot of great features and while figuring how to use it at first wasn't always intuitive, I am overall pleased with my purchase.It is large and heavy but I got used to it quickly.  I didn't like the band so I quickly replaced it with a third party band that is easier to put on/take off and prettier.The reason why I can't rate it 5 stars is the battery life, oh my god, it's so bad.  I knew when I ordered that if I had all features enabled I would need to charge it daily, I was prepared for that but in real life I found myself having to charge it twice a day, which is too much if I am out and about all day.  I do like that it charges rather quickly and it goes from 12% to 100% in less than 2 hours.I tweaked settings to conserve battery such as changing the watch face, having it turned off unless I specifically press the button, turning off NFC, not playing music, and no longer using it for phone conversations.  Now I am able to get away with charging it once a day but I feel like I don't use it as much in general because so many features were disabled for battery-saving purposes.I like the variety of apps that are available, I didn't like that I had to install apps to do things I feel I should have been able to do out of the box.For the most part, I like the watch, I just wish I could do more with it without being a slave to its battery needs."", ""Beautiful and well made Wear OS watch.  Getting a full day of battery with heavy use. The only problem is a known issue.  The watch is advertised to make and receive calls but there is a software glitch in all of the Gen5 Fossil watches that makes the audio impossible to hear during a call.  Fossil claims a software release will fix it in September.  We will see.  I am considering returning it and hope I still can if the software doesn't fix it.-Update- There has been no update and my window to return is up, so back it goes.  I really wanted to love it and for the most part, the watch was excellent."", ""Let me start by saying I love this watch. This was my first, real smartwatch purchase. I wanted something stylish that was also functional and could be worn dressed up or down. I love the apps that are offered through it and i have weather, heart rate and fitness tracking, timer and other great tiles added to my short cuts. I like that i can review texts and emails, reply to them and even use emojis. I do enjoy the music control function as i stream often through my phone while i work out, and i can skip tracks easily through the watch without having to stop and pick up my phone. I dont wear it in the shower but i do wash dishes with it on, I bathe my kids and my dog with it and have sweated so much that it was wet underneath. It's not perfect, but definitely worth the investment. Ive had it almost a month and will update if anything changes.Pros:Heart rate tracker accuracyAdjustable band that was includedLarge face but not too heavyWatch band breathesWaterproof!Cons:Doing anything which requires flexing my hand back (think:doing a push up) makes the google voice activate.Touch is sometimes non responsive or too responsive (this is probably user error)Does not have TIDAL, only spotify app. Boo"", ""I wanted to love this.  I have worn a Fitbit Alta for a couple years and wanted to update to a smart watch.  I loved the look of this, but honestly, that was about all I did like.As a Fitbit user, I had gotten used to a lot of fitness features, including accurate step count, heart rate and sleep tracking.  This watch uses Wear OS and Google Fit, which are sorely lacking.  There is no in app sleep tracking,  and user forums directed me to a 3rd party app that requires you to have your phone in bed with you.  No thank you.  Google Fit seems pretty accurate with step count, but I couldn't tell if it was using my phone or the watch to track them (I still have the app on my phone,  and it tracked my steps today without the watch on).  The heart rate seemed accurate, but it only checks it every 10 minutes or so.It seems to be a nice watch, and Google Assistant was handy to respond to texts or look something up.  Maybe now that Google is buying Fitbit,  I'll try it again later, but as it stands, I returned this watch."", ""I really enjoy this watch however if you run all the apps off of it your battery on it is going to drain really quickly so I run it as minimally as possible and I still have battery life like 80% even with the extended battery stay on it. I ended up having to buy new watch bands for it because I don't think the band on it is as stable as it could be but I do like it. So I ended up going with the Barton Buckle watch and feels more secure on my wrist and I like that. I think the app could use a little more work though because it seems to pick up most of the work out stuff off of Google fit so you kind of need to 2 apps in-away. Another thing with the watch is that the face is pretty big so if you don't like big face watches that kind of cover your wrist on the top  then I wouldn't recommend it. But other than that I'm pretty happy with the watch, and I would recommend it. Plus this is coming from somebody who uses $30 smart watches it's nice to have a good one on hand too."", 'We were so excited about these watches when we ordered them.

Now I’ve got it up and working but the only thing is it won’t stay connected if I close the Wear OS app on my iPhone 12. It’s making me keep the page open to keep it connected even though I have background refresh on.

I will be sending it in for repair and getting an estimate but knowing fossil makes both these items I'm highly skeptical of the quality of their products.

It does charge quick!I had heard the calling feature wasn't great,  so I tried it first thing and it definitely needs improvements, but I didn't get the watch to be able to make calls, so I'm ok with not using this feature.It does take some time to get used to the texting feature, but the talk to text feature helps.I do wish there were more apps, but overall the watch is great!

Realistically I have to charge it every other day if I use to it's full capability without the screen waking up every time I look at it. It does charge in about an hour so charging it every other day isn't a deal breaker.

I ordered a new Fossil Jullianna.  What arrived was NOT new.  In addition to the package NOT having the charger for the watch, there were several other indications this was not a new watch.

Could this have compromised security on ALL the phones apps?Although the watch itself is great- this was not a good experience- BE AWARE', 'Overall, I love the design and look of the watch. It’s a stunning piece with a mesh band that hasn’t caused any skin rash like the FitBit bands usually do. The organization structure is nice and the watch apps are easy to find. I really dislike the Wear OS app that is required to setup the watch. It took me over 2 hours to get my watch setup and I had to force a factory reset after it was stuck on time only mode. The Bluetooth keeps constantly disconnecting which I never had that issue with Fitbit or Apple Watches. Also the battery life is awful so I had to switch watch faces and make other changes to conserve battery life. It defeats the purpose of having all these different cool watch faces if I have to recharge twice a day if I use them. I’ll likely switch back to an Apple Watch but this one is an ok watch to use for now.', ""Absolutely love this watch!

I would totally recommend this watch.I am a little disappointed that I could not connect to the fossil app. The wear OS app it's okay but seems to be lacking some of the features I could almost see in the fossil app. So, this should not be a deal-breaker."", ""So, I purchased this watch in January 2021 and I purchased a screen protector. I dropped the watch from a height of three feet in February 2021. The screen (crystal) cracked. The screen protector kept the glass together, but eventually the crystal became shattered. I called many local watch shops, all stated that Fossil has a lockdown on their crystals and you have to service it through them. How much you might wonder, $150 to replace the crystal through Fossil's service department. Sigh. What a waste of money."", ""I had to send it back because the metal mesh wrist band was stuck and would not adjust, Im looking forward to a different model that has a black silicone band. I will update my review as things unfold. the communication from the returns department was lacking,  confusing and a false communication from them left me reeling, still waiting an email acknowledging they're mistake. Also, there were no instructions regarding the band and no online support on fossil.com regarding the band."", ""I love the look of the watch and feel of it. It was comfortable to wear and i have small wrists. It just didn't do what i wanted and the added apps didn't work that great either. I also bought it to use the speaker option and calls on it are impossible to hear. I bought the Galaxy active 2 and it's just better in my opinion.Also, i forgot that the other reason i couldn't wear it was because it started to irritate my skin under the face/ not the band. I'm thinking from nickel in the charging rings?"", ""I bought a 50$ watch and it stayed charged for a week but you couldn't do have the stuff this watch does. I customized the battery life so it can last a full day without dying and it works great. I got this watch on sale for $100 with 2 watch bands. I use the metal one more than the sport one. I use Google pay, make phone calls, and control my music all by my watch."", ""This is by far the prettiest smartwatch I've ever owned. It doesn't have that unisex look of Fitbits, instead looking stylish, while still providing the stats. A big step up from the Fossil hybrid I tried, too, although that one is also very pretty. I wish it had better battery life. Can't answer for the sleep tracking because that's when I charge the watch. Love the magnetic charger, too. Great buy! Thanks, Fossil!"", ""Really like this watch. It comes with a great band and a lot of watch faces. I used to have an apple watch and I was a little worried about making the switch to Google with a new Android phone, but I'm loving it. Battery life is actually better with the fossil, larger screen, and brighter colors. Also can I just say I love the fast charge on this watch, in one hour it's back to 100%. Can't do that with apple lol."", ""Bought this for my wife as a bday gift.  She loved it.Got the rose gold bezel with black band.Loves all the feature. It has Wear Os.Especially that she can read and reply to texts right from her watch.Answer and receive calls right fun her watch as well.Bought the Bluetooth version and I explained the differences to her and she is happy with her Bluetooth version.It has it's limits because watch has to be in Bluetooth range for features like text notifications and calls to work.Not a huge problem since she always had her phone nearby.Drawback with LTE version is it might not be compatible with your carrier. Extra cost to carry on certain plans that it does work with."", 'I purchased this watch to motivate myself to be more active and become more aware of my stats. As this is my first smartwatch, I was not sure what to expect but soon came to love it. There are however, two downsides to this watch. One, you have to charge every night and I personally wanted to track my sleeping pattern so this has proven to be simpler said than done. And second, adjusting the band to a smaller wrist proved to be problematic. There are no instructions or manual included with the smartwatch so I had to resort to youtube. Reading the comments in the video proved that I was not the only one struggling to adjust the band. Hopefully Fossil fixes this in future models...', ""I tried many smartwatches, looking out for size. The 40mm Samsung fit well but the face wasn't big enough. This watch is 44mm but is incredibly slim with a great beveled edge. The display is so clear and tough. The metal band dresses it up beautifully. The face doesn't bulge off my small wrist at all. The speaker is clear and the mic works well. The battery life sucks but it's a smartwatch. So that didn't bother me too much.Unfortunately I have to return it because of Wear OS. It keeps disconnecting from my phone (a Galaxy A50, so not old) and Assistant doesn't do texting at all. There are bugs that Google will get around to fixing at? some point? Such a bummer. If your Android phone happens to work with it, congrats. Ugh. I have to go back to Samsung and their stable Tizen."", ""I can't give a very fair review on the battery life or touch screen. The watch would not connect to my phone. I've connected many other devices to this phone and others and have had no issues. This watch would become stuck on the install screen. The phone said it was there; the watch never did. After resetting it multiple times and spending 4+ hours on it, it is time to return it. My first experience with the Fossil brand will likely be my last."", ""It's a beautiful watch and I received a lot of compliments on it.However, my screen went black and wouldn't turn on after I had it for just short of 6 weeks. I called Fossil, but because I purchased from Amazon,  they wouldn't honor warranty when purchased from a 3rd party. I only had a 30 day refund/warranty from Amazon. Luckily, they gave me an 80% refund, at least.  It's very disappointing,  when you spend that kind of money for a watch.Also, battery life only lasted 1 day, depending on the amount of phone calls/texts I received.  Doesn't matter now, since it won't turn on, but thought I'd add in that, too."", 'I love this watch so much. It looks great on my wrist. I like the fact that I get all notifications I need from my kids distance learning apps making easy no to miss a thing. I have an iPhone 11 and refused to get an Apple Watch because I like round shapes better on a Watch. It was challenging at first to find one that work well with iOS. It doesn’t give you notifications of sms single text messages or iMessages but I mostly use WhatsApp anyway.', 'First and foremost, I received the wrong watch. I ordered the Juilianna and received the Carlyle instead. After looking at it,Ive decided to keep it since it appears to be the same minus the rose gold rim detail.

Not able to hear or see connection when calling contacts. Will update as soon as I charge battery again and look more closely at a few things.', ""This watch is super cute and has all the functions I was looking for (notifications, calls, heart rate, etc) the band it comes with isn't the most comfortable and the battery life isn't great. If you want to wear it all day definitely should put it in extended battery mode."", 'I am a man and I got this watch. This is honestly just as fast as my phone but looks and feels great. The side notch is extremely smooth and better than touching the screen to scroll and navigate. The two additional buttons are customizable to open one app (first or third party) each. The screen is great to look at. It takes less than an hour to charge and then gets me through the entire work day (with always on mode ON and half brightness) and will get me home with ~50% battery left. I hope this watch will get future updates and support. I would highly recommend this watch to a friend and already have', ""I found it difficult to set up the watch both on my wrist and using the app. I also thought the dial face had poor touch sensitivity (didn't respond to swiping). The watch is also quite heavy (about twice the weight of current Apple Watch)––I tried to find the weight online before ordering and it wasn't listed anywhere, also not on Fossil's website. I am returning it."", ""Watch is great & exactly what I wanted.  Only problem is there are no instructions on how to operate the watch.  I had to get people who have smart watches to set it up for me.  I don't use the features because I don't know how to.  I have tried to download or get instructions but have not been able to so far.  I will keep trying.  In the meantime, I love the looks and it keeps accurate time."", 'Nice watch BUT the description should specify that you cannot send text from your watch when pairing with iPhone. Honestly not sure I would have spent the money if I had known that prior, since it’s implied that it does.  Also disconnects more frequently than I’d like and you still must be in range of your phone. Still very nice though and I’m enjoying it for most part.', ""This was a gift for my Gf for her recent birthday and she went absolutely crazy, bananas, and bonkers over this watch.

Also fossil is a life changing company for me now. The craftsmanship a quality of the watch is breathtaking.', 'Do NOT buy this watch. A lot of features work great, but others will not work at all. Like making/receiving calls through the watch or replying to texts on the watch. My wife spent hours talking to Fossil support and they told her ""it\'s a known issue that they\'re working on"". No fix. No timeline. No replacement or remedy. To be fair, the watch is terrific and my wife loves it. The issue is with Google\'s Wear OS, but it\'s a common, known issue with no fix.

There are even random days when I have to charge it mid morning and I have not done any tracking, but I did talk and text.  Sad sad sad.  It is almost impossible to see the screen outside too.  Other than those two things I like the watch.  Unfortunately I would not recommend this to a friend.', ""Bought the watch for my wife.

If you were to just use it for the watch feature it's brilliant, but after that it goes down hill fast. After I connected it to my phone it would disconnect then not reconnect so I'd have to unpair the two and start all over from the beginning. It comes with terrible instructions that barely tell you how to get the watch working. It's over constructed and underwhelming. The buttons only get it your way and constantly turn the watch on.

It\'s sporty and stylish, has excellent build materials and build quality, runs smooth and responsive, and offers numerous smart features and apps.  It took a LONG time for WearOS to mature into this but it\'s finally very good and desirable._____*Pros:-Sporty and clean design.-Good specs.-Even with Always-On Mode on, battery lasts a full day. 👍-One of the four Battery Modes offer the ideal setting for most people.-Google Assistant is very responsive and recognizes my voice commands very well.-All three buttons are responsive.  The rotating crown is smooth.-Touchscreen sensitivity is great and swipe gestures work well.-Tons of watchfaces to choose from.-Wear OS is snappy and smooth overall.-Notifications show up promptly and they\'re easy to dismiss.-The included wristband is comfortable and offers great adjustability range.-Wristband can be easily replaced with other ones.-I can swim with these!  👏_____*Neutral:-Phone call quality is so-so.-Setting up Google Pay was a bit buggy and took a couple of tries.-Once in a while, there is some slight lag between swipes and taps._____*Cons:-Under direct light, can\'t see anything, even with Sunlight Boost.-Inside the WearOS phone app, there should be a launchpad for a strictly WearOS app store section.-Downloading apps on the watch is slow or it just fails sometimes.===  Background  ===I\'ve been wearing a smartwatch daily since 2015 and I\'m totally into them.  Besides for telling time, I now depend on my smartwatch for many things - quickly glancing at notifications, answering phone calls, sending short emoji\'s and text messages discreetly, using voice assistant shortcuts and functions, keeping track of my exercise & heart rate, and using helpful apps such as a timer, stopwatch, alarm clock, calculator, and media controller.  Many times it is just better and faster to do these things on a watch than on a big and bulky smartphone, such as my Samsung Galaxy S10+.Before the Fossil Gen5, I was using smartwatches running on the Tizen platform and purposely avoided WearOS watches due to their comparatively lackluster performance, poor battery life, inadequate hardware, and so-so reputation.  The Fossil Gen5 Julianna changed my perception and showed me how good WearOS can be with proper hardware.===  Design & Hardware  ===In terms of design and hardware, the Fossil Gen5 Julianna is wonderful.  It looks sleek and elegant in gold and black, the buttons are responsive and offer satisfying feedback, and the wristband is great-looking and comfortable with a secure fit.  I really appreciate having the option of swapping out to any 22mm band according to my personal taste.Its 1.28"" display is crisp and big enough and the 44mm case size looks proportionate on my wrist.  Bluetooth, Wifi, NFC, and GPS worked perfectly and I never experienced any connection issues.The speaker quality for playing notifications and ringtones was adequately loud and clear.  For voice calls, however, it was a bit lacking.  Besides skipping voices on my end, many people complained about call clarity so I stopped using the watch as a phone.  In a pinch it\'ll do but it\'s not good enough to replace a smartphone\'s mic or even a Bluetooth headset.The vibration motor is merely adequate.  I wish the intensity could go up a few notches from its current maximum.  As it is now, I wouldn\'t be able to be woken up from my nap.  For notifications and calls, though, it\'s fine.Going back to the display, its legibility under direct sunlight is horrible.  Regardless of which watchface I use, I can\'t read anything.  With my previous Tizen watch (Gear S3 Classic), I could at least make something out if I squinted & brought it closer to my face.  Not so with the Julianna.  I have to tap the screen or press the Home button first.  This was so even with the Sunlight Boost mode enabled.One of my favorite hardware features is its ability to be worn during swimming.  I go to the beach often and prefer to have my watch with me.  With my previous watch, I had to take it off because it wasn\'t swim-capable and it was vulnerable to sand jamming up the rotating bezel.  With the Jualianna, I don\'t have to worry about any of that.  Love it!  😍Another feature that worked well was the NFC function for Google Pay.  Although I experienced a glitch during setup, it worked flawlessly after everything was set up and my credit card was enrolled.All in all, I\'m satisfied with the design and hardware.===  WearOS Apps & Ecosystem  ===My watch is currently on WearOS version 2.8 with the July 1st, 2019 Android security patch applied (as of 2019-09-02).  For everything I do with the watch, my experience has been very satisfactory.  Taps and button presses are registered right away and there is no frustrating lag.  Swipe gestures work very well and all of my apps open and launch almost immediately.The WearOS smartphone app is clean and well-organized.  Through it, I can change my watchface, set ""My Tiles"" app shortcuts, activate the ""Always-on screen"" setting, check on the storage level, and take screenshots of the watch.  What I find lacking, though, is no direct access to a WearOS-only app store.  I know I can open up the Google Play Store app, click on ""Categories,"" scroll down to the end and tap on ""Wear OS by Google.""  But it would\'ve been nicer if I could view all the WearOS apps from the WearOS app in a neatly categorized and sorted fashion.  The Tizen competition does a much better job in this aspect.An immediately perceptible strength of WearOS over its competition are its almost instantaneous notification alerts and the awesome Google Assistant AI.  Notifications show up quickly with no lag behind the smartphone.  The Google AI does a fantastic job recognizing my voice commands and acting on them.  The results show up almost as quickly as on my phone and the assistant\'s voice sounds very natural and clear.With Google making slow but continual improvements, I see a bright future for WearOS.===  My Verdict  ===Besides the direct sunlight legibility and poor voice call speaker issues, I see no other glaring faults with the Fossil Gen5 Julianna.  It looks great, WearOS is snappy and performant, and the AI assistant works supremely well.  It\'s a well-engineered and quality product from Fossil.  👍 👏', ""While I still think they are a bit gimmicky. There are loads of uses, it also drops the use of a phone when just needing to take a quick glance and notifications! Moreover, this helps with monitoring exercise as well.The point is, you take a watch, which is the main point, and give it more life, including ability to pay, notifications, calendar alerts, it vibrates when your phone is ringing, it tracks your exercise patterns, and gives you quotes, which were surprisingly accurate for what was going on in my life.The screen on this is amazing though! It is crystal clear, even in sunlight, and the colors just pop. Reminds me of a OLED with how black the blacks look and how well it does with colors.The dock to charge this is unique. I expected something to plug into it when I first ordered it. But it turns out that it is a magnetically attached charger with two pins that connect to a ring that is on the underside. It's connects to a standard USB2.0 or 3.0 style, and charges with either a computer or even most usb charge adapters. (I honestly couldn't find one that didn't work.)It also charges quickly, however, as a caveat, you need to charge it daily. This may be related to some of the settings.You do need to download the wear os software on your phone. The first time I tried to pair it, it failed, stuck at a setup phase and wouldn't get off. After an hour I closed the program on the phone, where the phone was pretending to be connected, but wasn't. So I reset it in the settings, and started the setup again. Where it paired really quickly. Most of the time went to syncing profiles over to it though, which the wear os program on the phone walks you through what you would want the watch to do though.I do like this watch allot, and it can work on a male wrist of medium width at max wrist band settings.It has become a staple wear, and I have used it every day since I got it."", ""I will review this product strictly from the perspective of having picked this up as a gift for my wife.  She is not the most tech-savvy, but can find her way around her phone and a Fitbit.  This seemed like a more stylish option than her fitbit and I thought she would enjoy the bigger screen for messaging and GPS and such.  I basically gave it to my wife and sat back to see how it went.  She seemed to be able to install the App and get the watch working fairly quickly.  First of all this is a beautiful device.  The screen seems much better and brighter than my Apple Watch.  The band was a huge hassle to figure out how to adjust.  I finally got it with a small screw driver to release the clasp.  Compared to the elegance of the Apple Watch band this was just a mess to deal with.  That alone took 15 minutes and there are no instructions for that.  After that my wife tried using it for a few days and finally just gave up.  She could not get it to deliver messages reliably from her iPhone.  She was unable to get the fitness apps working in a way that was useful to her.  She was able to customize her screen and it was very lovely, but that was about it.  I personally did not attempt to use the watch or fiddle around to see what else it could do, but for someone wanting a simple device to upgrade from Fitbit, this was not a very good gift.  I'm not sure what we'll do with it now, but she is clear that she does not want to continue using it.  That in itself speaks volumes."", 'If it weren\'t for one key feature, this watch would seriously knock it out of the park.The screen is extremely responsive and I never have to worry about a stray swipe or a missed swipe making me want to pound the watch with frustration.Screen is immaculate, sharp, and auto brightness (although a little on the aggressive side towards dimness) works in stride.  It has the all of the key components that you can expect from WearOS, and its integration with Google functionality (including maps, wow) is great.Voice recognition for responding to texts is also superb and works even better than my phone which is just as well since I\'d rather use the watch anyway!Watch faces are nice and wide-ranging in looks with many faces allowing up to 3, sometimes 4 customizable shortcut buttons in addition to being able to program shortcut to the hard buttons on the side of the watch.  Each one has an ""always on"" face that has low power consumption if you can\'t stand to not know what time it is without having to wake the watch.  ""Tilt to wake"" feature on the works very well without the ""wrist-shaking"" you may see from other watch users who are fighting the feature.While the built-in feature works GREAT for Google maps, answering questions from Google, etc., my watch cannot seem capable of being able to broadcast a phone conversation.  It supposedly has this feature, but I find the audio breaking up from a caller (reduced to gibberish - can\'t get a complete word out at all) and the caller can\'t hear me in turn.  This is odd considering how well everything else seems to work, especially with the voice-to-text required for text messages and ""Ok Google"" features.  I\'m not sure WHY it doesn\'t work but all my tweaking has yielded me no successful results on both the phone and the watch.  This costs me a star...that said, I rarely want to broadcast my phone calls to an audience, so it\'s not a deal-killer for me, but if you\'re invested in it as a feature then I would suggest you look elsewhere.', ""I don't know why they market this model as a women's version- it's definitely a unisex design, as the gold accent on the black watch is simple and classy. The size is no different from the versions marketed towards men, so I really don't get the designation of a women's watch.The Wear OS is new to me, I've been using a Garmin that I've been happy with but it's dated- I was looking for more modern features. Most of the more interesting features aren't rolled out for iPhone yet, unfortunately. I suppose that should be expected since Google Wear OS is obviously geared towards Android.Even with the limited functions, the processor is fast and the screen is extremely easy to read- which not a lot of smart watches can claim. I haven't yet tuned the battery for the best life for my application, but it tends to last quite a long time when used sparingly. Task it heavily with the fitness apps and it sucks the battery down very quickly.The band is nice, in that one can adjust it to exactly the size one wants- however the latches they use are a bit wonky. It took some trial and error to find just the right tightness for the sensors to work properly but not too tight. The infinite adjusting band is great in that sense, but I find the latch to be less than perfect.For Android users, I'd suggest giving this watch serious consideration- it's well made. For Apple users, check in with the Wear OS development to see where it stands at the time of your purchase."", 'I (a bit of a Fossil myself) had to get help from a favorite a niece, a petite and stylish 1st year teacher, Smartphone user and I got these details:The Fossil Google Smartwatch has been a fun addition to my workout AND wardrobe! It is definitely more stylish than other sport smartwatches. It looks like a watch I would buy anyways, but with the Smartwatch features. The set up is really easy, you just download and app on your phone and do the rest of the set up from there. You can also learn about and use features on your phone, which I like because it’s bigger and more broken down on the phone app. It’s easy to find your fitness data on the watch face as well. The only downside is it did feel a little bulky when I went on a run with it on, and the clasp sometime fell open (not unclasped, just the top part would come open and I would just shut it). But just walking around day to day it is a great, nice looking Smartwatch!', ""I have an iPhone and an Apple Watch Series 1.  I hate the looks of the Apple Watch, but love the functionality. It is pretty much the problem with any Apple product.  I ordered this watch hoping it would function well with the iPhone.  I also didn't realize it was marketed as a woman's watch.  Oh well.  It connected with the Wear OS app and was pretty simple to pair.It gave some notifications, but I was not able to make or receive phone calls on it.  I got text notifications but could not reply to them.  I also could not find the Text icon within the watch's menu.  I was extremely hopeful this watch would work the way I wanted it to.  But sadly it did not.  Hopefully Apple catches on and makes a watch that doesn't look like a miniature phone you wear on your wrist."", 'Great smart watch. Runs off google, which is great. But the interface is a little slow. Pixel quality is amazing. Vibration is minimal. Can barley feel it when it vibrates. Looks nice. Would recommend.', 'A useful watch for both health status and convenience.  I was looking for a device that provided sleep monitoring, built-in GPS for route tracking, sensors for pedometer and calories, and phone-like apps for notifications and comms.  This one has the heart-rate monitor, GPS hardware, motion sensors, and runs GearOS.  It has a full colour touch screen and runs a number of available apps, many of which pair with Android apps on the phone to relay notifications, messages, and calls.  There is a nice sleep app called Sleep as Android available.Spotify is integrated and the watch acts as a media controller for any other player on the phone as well.  You can even see images or slideshows from the phone.My only two concerns are the battery life and the band.  The watch needs charging at least once a day but has a nice magnetic charger that clips on the back in any orientation unlike similar products.  The band is not expandable to a wrist that changes during the day and I suspect the clasp might not last long.  Hopefully it will be replaceable.', 'Came in as an opened box. It was cold weather and the watch surface is already wet.The reaction is very slow when you click on buttons or touch screen.']"

While this has smart watch functions it's not why I got it. For me it's tracking my health and a long battery life.For smart watch use I simply have it vibrate on my wrist and then I look at my phone. This means I don't have to have annoying beeps and ringing.The battery has lasted over two weeks with daily cycling (60min).Screen is easy to read. It hasn't got the glam of the top tier touch screens but it's always on and clear.The strap is comfortable. Wide enough to not need it tight for everyday use. Do it up a notch when you get physical.Took a few tries to get the compass right. But works well now. GPS is quick to connect. I use the Garmin chest strap when exercising. The pair work together nicely. The wrist sensor is ideal for everyday use.Consider what you need before you purchase.

If it's glamour, messaging and reading emails you want then buy the watch that is good at that."", ""I had a Garmin Vivoactive 3 that had been dearly loved, but was now down to about 24h of battery between charges, so bit the bullet and sprung for the Fenix and am disappointed I didn't do it earlier. Fantastic battery life (10-14 days, depending on what I'm doing) and plenty of additional smarts - some gimmicky, some less so.  The body battery is a good example.  Rather meaningless, but I do like it.  The screen is clear, customisable through the Garmin app store and resistant to scratches, even as the non-sapphire model.  The buttons are old-skool, but solid and far more reliable than the touchscreen of the older vivoactive, which used to go crazy when wet.The GPS locks quickly and the Connect app continues to improve. The only improvements I'd want are wireless charging and perhaps a touchscreen option.  I wouldn't trade the buttons for one, but there are times when both would be nice (eg touch is more intuitive for the smart watch features when not exercising)."", ""I love that oxygen was an added measurement & it's what made me finally splurge on getting a watch. Unfortunately this reading requires you to not be in motion so isn't taken during a work out. (the only time I wear the watch)I was also excited to see climbing was included because I was interested in how my measurements changed during a climbing season and how much it varied between bouldering and lead climbing. Unfortunately the pre programmed trackers for those activities require you to enter route information and click the start/stop before and after each individual route. Which I find massively disruptive. This as well as climbing grades been rather uninformative to track across every route/problem of a session. So I gave up on the watch while in the climbing gym.Great for running and swimming though."", 'Experienced runners will likely find Garmin\'s training advice irritating. Garmin thinks that my marathon training is ""unproductive""; however, they need to consider more than just VO2max.It only detects my sleep about once a week, despite me wearing it 24/7 (excluding recharge time).The temperature sensor is a joke, as it can\'t differentiate between body and air temperature.I\'ve paired it with HRM-Pro in an attempt to use Running Power for pacing. Unfortunately Garmin Connect does not display it for splits correctly, forcing me to implement a work-around.The Garmin Forerunner which I owned over a decade ago was better.', 'It was at least $100 cheaper than in store.

I do miss my Apple Watch, but its fragility and need for daily charging were deal-breakers for me, hence the switch to the Fenix 6.

Le seul plus que j’ai trouvé à ce stade, c’est la batterie. Je vais faire encore quelques sorties avec et si les bugs persistent, je renvoie la montre !', 'This is going to be a longer review, as i had issues finding the info i wanted on this watch. I wrote this for the tactix delta, but it also applies to the fenix. The smaller one is the fenix, the larger one with the better contrast screen is the tactix delta.The fenix 6X and tactix delta are exactly the same size, the only difference is the styling.I originally bought the Fenix 6 pro, which had a really bad purple screen/bad contrast when the backlight was on. I also found it a bit small for my tastes. These fenix and delta have the same ""internals"" and features. The tactix comes with some mostly irrelevant extras like night vision mode and stealth mode, which don\'t really do anything special for me.I bought the tactix delta for 2 reasons:1) I love the styling on it, much more so than the fenix 6X pro, this was a major deciding factor despite the price difference.2) THE SCREEN -- the fenix series is about 50/50 or worse depending on which one you buy to get the ""good"" screen or the purple one. If you look at my pictures, with the backlight on, the tactix is clearly superior. Now, for the fenix, if you want a sure bet to get a good screen, you have to buy the solar. If you buy the sapphire version, it\'s 50/50, if you buy the regular pro, you\'re most likely to get a \'bad\' one. The tactix has a very high chance of getting the good screen.Once again, this is only noticeable with the backlight on, otherwise, the 2 screen look identical outdoors.Size difference:- i found the 6 pro a bit small and the bezel too pronounced, my wrist circumference is about 7.2 inches, which is average. I took a picture with both watches on my hand so you can get an idea.- I find the size clearly bigger, but i like it.- Weight wise, i can barely tell the difference.- I find the larger one to sit better on my wrist, the extra width means the strap sits more comfortably.Battery life:- going one size up, it\'s about an extra 50% battery life, which is a nice bonus- the 6 was lasting me about 7-10 days with about 4-5 hours of sports with gps + music in that time frame.- the bigger size is about 10-12 days for the same sort of use.- this can be improved if you turn off the spo2 measures during sleep and the wrist gesture for the backlight.Sapphire screen:- going sapphire makes the screen much more reflective, this does reduce visibility, and it can be a bit distracting. But i don\'t find it annoying enough to trade it for gorilla glass which is fairly scratchable.My experience with sapphire screens:I\'ve had a Bering watch with a sapphire screen that\'s about 10 years old, so i knew what to expect. It\'s nearly impossible to scratch, in the 10 years i\'ve had it still looks new with not as much as fine scratch, i believe only diamond can damage it and maybe sand.Other differences:- nothing else really, exactly the same as the fenix, same features.- i find the spo2 reading more accurate, as i said, this size sits better on my wrist so i feel the sensors have better contact as well.Which one should you buy?- If you like the look of the fenix series and dont care about screen, any will be great choice.- if you like the fenix series and absolutely want a good screen you have 2 choices:a) buy the solar for 100% guaranteeb) buy the sapphire but be ready for returns, which amazon might not likec) i believe garmin will accept a warranty claim on itSize wise, if you like bigger watches, 100% go for X or tactix delta. If you like smaller, go for the 6S, i\'d only pick the regular 6 if you want the little bit of extra battery life.', 'Ho letto e riletto le recensioni degli altri utenti che ritengo sempre molto importanti. Incredibile, veramente un orologio incredibile. Vengo da un Apple Watch, che è un ottimo oggetto, che però ha una carenza pazzesca ... la batteria.

Cioè, detta come deve essere detta, il top.', 'After 1 week:I wanted a forerunner 945 but there was no reduction for black friday. The finix 6 was reduced considerably & has the same feature set so the decision was made. Overall it has surpassed expectations. I was not sure about wearing a monitor all the time, but this has changed my mind.Physically it is much nicer in person than in pictures. I wanted the 945 as i thought the fenix would be too big but its nicely proportioned. Its not in any way heavy, sits well on my wrist,  and does not get in the way.It looks good, kind of like a refined G-Shock.Ive cycled, ran and done some strength workouts with it and its comfortable for all, although care is needed during strength workouts not to forget about it and bump it aginst kettlebells/barbells/dumbbells etc. It feels like it would take abuse but i still dont want to test it.GPS is fantastically accurate, it tracks the road perfectly on the bike and during a run.Heart rate monitoring seems accurate. ive been comparing it to my Samsung health heart tracker and it usually matches perfectly, it is inaccurate however if the strap is too tight, but its easy to find the right point, as its exactly where the watch feels comfortable.I\'ve worn it for sleep and have not found it awkward or annoying at all. I cannot comment on its sleep accuracy, but the amount of  deep sleep/rem time it registers does coincide with when i wake up refreshed and rested vs groggy.Battery life is excellent. Out of the box it had just under 50% and after 8 days it was at 18%, at which point i charged it just because i was heading out for a cycle. in that time it had two cycles and a run using the GPS.The ""MOVE!"" notifications are great, and made me realize that I dont move much from one end of the day to the other when working, so now i get up every hour for a quick stroll and stretch.It does notifications well too, letting me know if the phone is ringing, if i have a meeting or if i got a message. I expected nothing in this area as i read it was poor as a smart watch, but it does everything that i need and more.Nothing is perfect, and the biggest negative is its tracking of strength workouts. the rep counter is poor, and its a bit of a chore overall to create workouts & then use the watch correctly while doing workouts, often while gassed and not in the best shape for concentration. Ive found it best to enter workouts in via the app, track the rounds with the watch as im working out and correct the reps and times afterwards. not ideal but it suffices and allows me to keep all workouts in garmin connect.I would dock only half a star for this, but unfortunately thats not possible on Amazon.Will give an update after a few months to notify future potential buyers if everything is still living up to expectations.Update after 7 months:Still a fantastic piece of kit, one of the very very few items that has lived up to expectations.', 'Amazons response to replace my faulty device was good (as expected).

Amazing beautiful watch - perfect companion for a journey to good health.Pros:1. Great battery life - I have been using this watch full blast with always on display and using the EDA sensor at least thrice a day, and installing and uninstalling so many watch faces. Third straight day, and the battery is still there.Edit: In a month I installed so many apps and watch faces and have now stabilised with select 5. Battery performance is superb. On weekends I forget to charge and it is cool.2. The EDA/ stress sensor: Very responsive. I checked the EDA scan feature a few times. It actually gave more EDA responses when I was a little stressed. Seems like a very handy tool for me - especially because I have had stress related issues in the past. It is a perfect companion for my daily meditation and Yoga practice too.Edit after a month usage: EDA/ stress sensor is good but it doesnt tell you anything you dont know already.For future edit: At times, I feel restless and anxious - and I calm myself by taking a quick walk around. Will check what the EDA scan says at that time. Will update - still havent faced the issue again.3. Heart rate tracker - It is fitbit's best. And fitbit is already the best out there in HR tracking. So no further comments.Edit after a month: At times while exercising, I feel there is a lag in the heartbeat numbers. Or maybe that's how our hearts work - they take some seconds before they can fire up. :) Will keep an eye on this.4. Notifications: Using with iPhone. Everything as expected. If it could show a preview of the image in messages, it would have been awesome! I did see this discussion happening in the fitbit developer forum - so I guess it is in the works.Edit after a month: Still no news on image in notifications. I don't mind this though.5. Step tracking - Precise.6. Sleep tracking - Sweet.Edit after a month: One of the most used features for me - everyday sleep score tracking is really helping me with my stress management. Recently got an 'excellent sleep' badge tag - for the first time in my 2 years of fitbit usage (wore Inspire HR earlier - that also tracked sleep)7. Band is too light - I have upgraded from fitbit inspire HR. Had used an after market stainless band for that - compared to that, the sense band is thin air. While sleeping, I tend to forget I am wearing the sense.8. Special tid-bits that I loved:a. It has a smart alarm feature - which wakes you up before your alarm if you complete a sleep cycle within half an hour of your upcoming alarm. This makes you wake up fresh af, instead of groggy - like the regular alarms do, if you are in the middle of your sleep cycle. Neat.b. Amazing watch-faces. A lot of free options to choose from. The one which allows personal photos to be put up as a watch face is cool. I bought a chronograph one for 1 dollar. Can change accent color as per my clothing. Pretty cool. Too many amazing watch faces.Edit after a month: Too many sweet free watch faces. Paying a dollar wasnt worth  the purchase I made a month ago. :Dc. Many knick-knack apps you can install and try on. I like the weather app and the news app. Guess more will be coming soon. Flipboard doesnt work yet - guess it will work in future.Special trick: Made the ECG work in India by just changing the location to US in the app profile. No VPN required. Works like a charm! What an easy way to hoodwink the policy loopholes - guess it was designed that way - makes one an accomplice in cheating the policy, though. Smart...Cons:1. It is not apple smart watch. I know brand 'apple' is a deciding factor for many. This is not apple - but the build quality looks as good. Will have to see how this thing wears down over next few months/ years.2. Fitbit premium app : The free version of the app shows almost all the metrics (except a few detailed explanations, like the stress score details, monthly trends of sleep parameters etc.). While the sense comes with a 6 months membership of the premium part of the app, I would not really want to spend some 849 rs per month post 6 months of buying a 30k smartwatch! Fitbit guys - you need to curb your greed! Guess when google takes fitbit over, this issue will be sorted out.---Will update the review after a month of usage - DONE. Edited above."", '月額1480円のサブスクに登録しないとオフラインで音楽聴けないところをなんとかして欲しい。過去作ではそんな仕様じゃないんだから。spotifyをウォッチから再生したり止めたりできる機能なんていらない。他は素晴らしい。スマホ持たずに音楽聴きながらランニングしたいという人にはおすすめしません。そうじゃない人にはおすすめします。', 'Charge3からの乗り換えになります。トラッカーとスマートウォッチの差からでしょうか、見易さ（視認性）は良くなりました。Fitbitアプリは変わらないので、Senseに移行して項目が増えただけな感じなので違和感はほとんどありません。電池の持ちですが、常時点灯で使っているのですが丸一日で残量80%ちょっと、大体5日持つ計算でしょうか。（文字盤によって電力省が変わるかわかりませんが、比較的シンプルなものを使っているのでご参考程度で。）個人としては、習慣として1日1回必ず充電するので全く問題ないです。ちなみに、海外のレビューで常時点灯にすると寝る時もついていて使えないというようなレビューがあったのできになっていたのですが、スリープ設定しておくことでスリープ時間中はちゃんと消灯します。別のレビューでタッチパネルの反応に遅延があると書かれていましたが、若干気になるところもありつつ自分としては許容範囲です。ただ、Charge3に比べてバイブレーションが弱い(気がする)のがちょっといただけません、歩いていると時々通知に気づかないこともあるので。まだ使用して1週間弱ですが、トータルとしては満足しています。注意点ですが、EDAの計測はディスプレイ全体を手で覆って金属フレーム部分で検出を行います。傷つき防止のために全面保護タイプ（液晶フィルムではないカバータイプ）のカバーを付けたのですが、金属フレーム部分も覆ってしまうので機能が働きません。もしかしたら自分が購入したものだけ？という可能性もありますが、理論上どの製品も同様かと。カバー購入をお考えの方はご注意を。', ""L'application ecg n'est pas disponible au Canada.Les notifications sms et agenda ne s'affichent pas sur la montre (meme apres avoir contacte service à la clientèle) .Impossible d'accéder à la température.Pas moyen de désactiver l'éclairage durant la nuit, il faut toujours le faire manuellement.Le fameux affichage permanent c'est seulement l'heure en gris.De plus lorsque j'ai écrit au service à la clientèle on m'a simplement envoyé des liens (que j'avais déjà lu en ligne) aucune réelle aide ne m'a été apportée.Vraiment déçue du produit, surtout étant donné le prix payé.  Je l'ai retourné en moins de 24 heures pour un remboursement."", ""This is my first ever smartwatch, so I can't compare this device's functionality to other watches, much less other fitbit products. The reason I bought this version was because it was the only smartwatch I could find that had all the features I wanted -- the stress management in particular was appealing.That said, the watch itself is... underwhelming. While my experience with it has been more on the positive side and I'm not planning to return it, I can't actually disagree with any of the negative reviews posted here. Having to turn the screen on manually is annoying, the setting to turn it on when you look at it doesn't always work (especially when laying down), and the always-on display drains way too much battery, which already doesn't last as long as I had hoped.I definitely had hoped for on-demand pulse ox readings as well, being that I'm asthmatic, but since sleep apnea was another thing I've been concerned about, I at least get some functionality out of that.The app does have the syncing issue someone else mentioned, but it doesn't actually bother me. The sleep feature also works perfectly for me.I am getting a lot of useful data with it, and I can't wait to wear it swimming, once the pandemic is over. It's a fine watch, but for the price? I don't know if I can recommend it, personally."", 'This is a very nice smartwatch with a lot of positives.  If you are looking at the Sense you are probably looking at an Apple watch as well.  Hopefully, I will be able to help you make up your mind after reading this review.Let me start off by saying that I currently own an Apple watch (Series 4) and absolutely love it.  I am a watch collector and never thought I would wear the Apple watch as much as I do.  I have 30+ watches and since I bought the Apple two years ago, I very rarely wear the others at all.  That is saying something!  Since I got the Fitbit, I have been “geeking out” and wearing one on each wrist.  Yeah, I know, I look like an idiot.  I just wanted to test out the two side-by-side and couldn’t think of a better way to do it.  Note:  While reading the review, keep in mind that the Sense is more comparable to the newer Series 6 so consider this when making your decision.Battery Life *****The Fitbit has a fantastic battery life.  I can squeeze about a day and a half out of the Apple, but I can easily get twice that with the Fitbit.  Keep in mind I have the Fitbit set to constant on.  If I took that setting off, I should get close to a week.  My Series 4 doesn’t have the constant on setting, but Apple claims 18 hours for the Series 6 with this setting.  The Fitbit definitely wins this one.Steps/Activity/Sleep ****The Fitbit tracks all my activity as well as the Apple and I like the sleep tracking better on the Sense.  It gives me more information than the Apple and the fact that I don’t have to wake up and charge it before leaving the house is a definite plus.  With the Apple, I have to make sure I put it on the charger after I wear it through the night or it won’t make it to the end of the day.  Another win for the Fitbit when you take the sleep tracking into account.Sensors ****I am giving the Fitbit a 4 here, but I found the Apple does a better job with my heart rate.  I have a chest strap I use for working out and the Apple was pretty much dead on with the chest strap.  I found the Fitbit to be a bit “laggy” when it came to giving me instant feedback for my heart rate.  When selecting my workout, I also found the Apple had more workout options compared to the Fitbit.  I did find the Fitbit more accurate when it came to counting my flights of stairs however.  The oxygen sensor on the Fitbit is also a nice plus and since the Series 4 doesn’t have this option I can’t really do a comparison.  The Sense also as a skin temp sensor and an EDA sensor that measures stress levels.  I found I didn’t really use either that much, but you may find these valuable.  I do like the fall down feature on the Apple which the Sense does not have.  This is especially a good feature for anyone who lives alone or has issues with balance.  The watch will dial 911 and the contacts you set up if you are immobile for any amount of time.  Overall, both watch sensors work well and each has plenty of extras.  Depending on your needs you may like some features better than others, but I would have to say this one is pretty close.Apps/Extras ***Since I am using an iPhone, this gives an unfair advantage to the Apple watch and the apps/watch faces are simply better than those on the Fitbit.  For example:  I use Golfshot+ (recommended) on my phone/watch and it is excellent.  Unfortunately, I could only find one app for golf on the Sense and I was not impressed.  Notifications from my various devices (MyQ, Skybell, Blink cameras, etc.) are great on my Apple, but nonexistent on the Fitbit.  The wallet also works better on the Apple watch as well.  Fitbit in Canada supports Visa/Mastercard, but not Amex as of yet.  I can also add music to my Apple watch, but cannot add any on the Fitbit.  You can only get music on the watch with a $13.50 CAD premium subscription.  Fitbit does give you 6 months for free though.  Even though I am not a huge fan of Siri, it does work better than Alexa on the watch.  If I was using an Android phone, maybe it would work better.  Another issue I had was answering texts and phone calls.  With the Apple, I can return texts and answer phone calls on the watch itself.  Unfortunately, you can only respond to texts on the Sense if you have an Android phone.  Finally, watch faces are another thing Apple does better.  While there are plenty of really nice third party watch faces for the Sense, you pretty much have to pay for most of them.  With Apple they are all free and you can tweak them to your liking.  Apple definitely wins this one.  In all fairness, since I didn’t pair this with an Android, I am still giving the watch three stars in this category.Comfort/Straps/etc. ****The Sense, like the Apple, is very comfortable to wear.  They are both very light and you don’t even know they are on your wrist.  In fact, when I first switched to a smartwatch, I found this took a bit of getting used to as I always wore a watch that had some weight.  Unlike a traditional watch, the straps on the two watches are very easy to change so you can quickly go from sport to dress with no tools required.  Both are also easy to read and manipulate when opening apps, changing faces, etc.  I’d have to say this is a tie.  However, I do like the crown on the Apple better than the button on the Sense and I did find the Apple to be “snappier” during everyday use.Overall, this is an excellent watch.  There is certainly a lot to like and it costs $100 less than the 40mm Series 6 Apple.  If you have an Android phone, I think this is probably the one to buy.  Since I am using an iPhone, I find the Apple watch integrates better and can do more when it comes to apps, calls, etc.  I suppose it really boils down to what you want to do with the watch.  Both work very well and if you own an iPhone the decision may be a bit more difficult.  After wearing it for a couple of weeks, I have really gotten used to the Sense and I am especially fond of how much better it is in the battery department.  I may just have to keep wearing both.Recommended!Good luck with your decision/purchase.', ""This is my first smart watch (apart from the Versa 2 I tried briefly which I thought was just not worth it). It's a bad product. Bad design, bad software, etc. I don't really want to give a detailed review as their are just too many negative points to go through, many of which have already been covered by other reviews here and reviews online.Update: I kept the watch in the end even though I had a bitter feeling about it. There have been software updates recently that have rectified some things and added some functionalities, which makes it somewhat more worthwhile than before. Still many problems though, and they introduced new problems with the recent firmware updates.Update 2: I think it's worth mentioning that it's been many times the alarm doesn't go off, not something that should happen with such a basic and essential feature.

I have ~16-17cm wrists and it fits nicely. Could have gone up to the 6, but figured the 6S would be more easier to live with personally. Owned this watch for about 1 month, works an absolute treat. The >$1K AUD price tag might be a bit steep, but when on sale (purchased ~$900) it's a good deal with all the features that comes with it.I find that the GPS is accurate (GPS + GLONAA, 1 second recording, 1-2 mins of GPS soaking), HR tracking is fine, SpO2 sensor a little off, sleep tracking and body battery tracking surprisingly accurate.

Only problem with it was that the solar did not work. Could not get any solar charge. The solar intensity chart remained at 0% no matter how much direct sunlight it got. To Amazon's credit they did provide a full refund but not a replacemnt which was also disapointing because I goit the watch during the cyber sales.

Back to using my Fenix 6 pro and it is easily the best all-rounder multisport watch I have used and will contionue to use."", 'I’ve long been a fan of Garmin devices and previously have had a Fenix5x for some years. The data and feedback it gives is amazing. I am also a massive fan of the inbuilt training options. The Fenix 6 is a bug step forward from the 5 and the metadata is excellent. I bought the device on special and use it a lot, so the price is mostly justifiable; however, at retail, you’d want to genuinely be interested in training pay full price. That said, any of the cheaper Garmin options are also excellent products if you don’t need/want all the bells and whistles.', 'I have had Fenixes for last 4 years, all S models and Sapphire glass. Most have had a lifespan of over a year and as an active athete previously I was always out and about, doing stuff, with the watch on. Over time the rubber bands would all we worn out but surprisingly none ever had significant issues with the glass.I have had this watch for about a month now and the glass just isnt comparable. I live a non-active life at the moment and honestly I have barely done anything and it already has multiple scratches on the glass. I did consider this when buying this watch but didnt realise the difference is going to be this significant.', ""Have yet to work through a lot of the features in depth but everything I've set up to date works well. This watch has far more to offer than I'll ever need; it's capability exceeds mine in many areas. Using only the health monitoring basics so far I have found the battery life to be great. The size is something new for me after only ever wearing a conventional watch prior to this one. I'm happy that I chose the smaller model. I can see that this watch will serve any active/sporting person very well.

And it never runs out of charge, so I can hike all day & night & now that all the data & the route are being recorded. The Fenix & Garmin displays are awesome!', ""I bought the watch back in June and have been getting consistent issues with it from the start.First the step tracking wouldn't persist reliably, some days just don't log in the historic graphs despite wearing the watch (and hitting my goals).The sleep tracking has the same  problem except it has never recorded a nights sleep historically. You can get the sleep information off the watch but not through the Garmin app.I ignored these problems since historical tracking wasn't a huge issue to me as I could just keep up on a daily basis but the other day I went for a hike and wanted to track the distance, apparently over the ~10km trek I moved 0km and gained 0m in height. The map knew where I was whenever I checked it but for some reason the activity failed to log distance, since then it's failed to do so for my daily walking activities as well, and hasn't logged any of my step counts to my historic graphs.Incredibly disappointing to buy a premium product and have it fail to deliver even the most basic features."", ""Loves the features of this watch but the battery life isn't the best.

I am very happy with the purchase. I have had the watch for one month and still learning all of the features and using the widgets and tracking for fitness and riding. I purchased the solar option and seems to be a nice to have but not a must have feature and not sure if the extra $ is necessary unless you have a reason to have it. The only negative I see at this stage is the watch seems to disconnect from the phone from a relative short distance (1 room away etc) which can be annoying.

"Apple Watch SE (GPS + Cellular, 40mm) - Space Grey Aluminium Case with Midnight Sport Band - Regular ",https://www.amazon.com.au/Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B09G9C5HPV,"['I am an Apple fanboy, having many of their products, but I was hesitating for a long time in purchasing their watches as the short battery life has always out me off. Eventually after years of procrastination I took the plunge - resulting in this review.The Apple Watch SE does everything I want from such a product and overall I am very happy with it. Granted, battery life still sucks, at most I can squeeze out 2 days and a bit per charge, using it only for the barest of things such as glancing at the time occasionally or checking for messages. No fancy fitness tracking etc., and even with WiFi turned off.I would love to give it a full 5 star but one overriding shortcoming is the very dim display within dark environments. The auto-brightness feature cannot be turned off (as opposed to iPhones and iPads), and the employed algorithm to regulate the brightness is way too agressive biased towards saving battery life at the expense of legibility of the watch in dark scenarios.This shortfall is well known beginning with Apple Watch Series 5, and has carried over to the SE and Series 6 models as well. Countless disgruntled users on various online forums ask for the same thing: ""Apple, please give us a switch to disable auto-brightness, or some other means to set a higher brightness level at low lights"". So far Apple decided to ignore these calls, and one can only hope that with a future Watch OS release there will be a fix for this.In summary: if you wear glasses and want to check the time at night in your bedroom, you will struggle without glasses to make out the current time. Therefore, one of the most needed and wanted features of any smart watch is a big fail with the latest Apple watches!', 'This watch is a good mix between the cheaper and older series and the newer series apple watches.Does what you’d expect, haven’t ran into any issues yet. The provided silicone band is not my taste so I always opt for other bands, but that’s personal preference.', 'Functionally indistinguishable from series 6, great watch that will satisfy your smart watch needs. Worthwhile Upgrade from series 3', 'Product lasted 2 days before being unresponsive - have had to send back for replacement', 'Apple watch itself is really good, easy to navigate but the only downside of it is that needs to be charged every night.']"

The reason I give it a one-star because I want my message to be seen by other customers (most people would sort by lowest rating), and I think my advice is helpful as I've used and compared a few Fitbit models.Overall it is a pretty good deal. You are getting so many functions like contactless payment, building GPS and so on at this cheap price level. The design is awesome too!However, as an avid mountain biker, GPS accuracy in the bush is essential for me. I tracked my riding with Charge 4, and the GPS accuracy is terrible comparing with my previous Fibit Ionic based on the route on Strava. As a result, I returned it.If I were a customer who does not care about GPS accuracy, I'd give it a 5 star for sure. However, if you are someone who wants a serious GPS tracker, stay away from it!"", ""Inbuilt GPS highly inaccurate on multiple occasions (all my runs). Shows me teleporting some 1km during my run which leads to inaccurate pace times (1h/km to 2min/km). The only thing I can count on is overall pace.Using the dynamic GPS which links with the phone's GPS saves battery but also shows the same issues as the inbuilt GPS.I had tried troubleshooting recommended on forums, but nothing has solved these issues.SpO2 not provided unless you are premium. This also includes other features. Considering this was an important aspect of my purchase I was not happy with this.That being said, the fit is fine, the heart rate monitor appears to be quite accurate. Do note that the calories burned during exercise need to be taken with a grain of salt as it appears they are overestimated on most of my activities.I like the sleep metrics as it gives me a visual on how to improve my sleep as I go through the different sleep cycles. So far it appears to be quite accurate in accordance to my actual sleep and wake times.Overall a nice watch for HR monitoring, comfort and fit, as well as sleep analysis. But if you're seriously about accurate GPS and having to pay premium for SpO2 I would consider another watch."", 'It’s a decent watch for the price. Not everything is exactly accurate - sleep is off and steps are occasionally not entirely accurate, but it’s nothing super bad and for the price it’s super worth it. I’m still in the 3 month premium trial period with the app that comes with the product, so I’m not sure what the free app version is like, but the paid version is decent, mostly the sleep is just not super accurate so take it with a grain of salt.', 'Same issue I had previously with the charge 2.  Lining up\\getting the watch to charge with its bump and grind contact system is a nightmare.  Not sure what possessed me to buy a 4 after having an ordeal with the 2 everytime i needed to charge it.  Got sucked in by the online reviews i guess, i thought that this was different or at least improved.  Massive PITA to just simply the battery, a fundementally flawed system. Support for the issue is wilfully ignorant.', 'I can’t use this watch for what I wanted it for, keeping an eye on my blood pressure.  The differences from when I tested my watch against my portable, health recognised, blood pressure monitor, varied too much when my blood pressure was higher.  The easy way to use it was perfect as you could swipe easily through.  The face of the watch was quite big too but no doubt necessary to hold all the inside mechanism', 'Love the variety of functions . I did have a problem butte return process was very quick and easy and the replacement is issue free .', 'I bought the Charge 4 for its inbuilt GPS, however, it has been a major disappointment.  It does not stay connected for the full length of my run and does not reconnect.  Consequently it cannot show data related to sections of the run and only estimates information for the run leading to large differences in information related to exactly the same route.  Good feedback provided if you pay to subscribe to the Premium app.  Bottom line is do not buy it if you require the inbuilt GPS.', 'I would give this a five star, except I find the swiping action a bit on the fiddly side. It mistakes swiping for selecting a good part of the time. The attached band also a bit sweaty, maybe a better material should be used. Also, sometimes does not detect movement and thereby give credit for steps. Overall, however, I like the device.', ""Great fit, small profile so unobtrusive, good battery life, excellent features. Does the simple things well, like tell the time and date, and the fitness things are great too - steps, heart rate, sleep, movement reminders. One frustration is it sometimes loses GPS signal when I'm on a long walk, so I'm not able to track my activity unless I use the phone. But otherwise, really happy with it."", 'I like the range of information available to me each day and after a nights sleep. Comfortable to wear and the app is very user friendly. No dislikes.

The watch does everything perfectly except one ESSENTIAL thing and that is to turn on the display when required. Unlike an apple watch the wrist gesture to turn on the display is VERY unreliable. The gesture seems to be tuned to an outdoor situation where someone standing will raise their arm to look at the time. It should have occurred to Garmin that people wanting an OLED display would likely be using the watch in more domestic/office situations. If Garmin don't fix this then then it is hard to recommend that people buy this watch. The other serious flaw in this watch is that there can be an unacceptable delay (up to 4 seconds) in the turn on time for custom watch faces downloaded from the IQ app. Garmin has some work to do if they want to compete with Apple and Samsung in the smart watch area. Venu can't just be a Vivoactive with an OLED slapped on!!!"", ""Hi, the watch itself is nice, good display.Aside from a light burn feeling on skin due to sensors and redness probably due to wristband. .. (never had these problems with 24/7 365 days of use for 3 years with Fitbit Versa 1...Overall the Venu is disappointing and I decided to return it. It is not good for the price.Touch screen display is a little inaccurate... (I have thin fingers and Versa was more reactive).Sleep tracking is stupid and USELESS! and you need to adjust your time of sleep every morning if you rememeber at what time you went to bed. In fact, it will calculate your sleep time when you tell him you are going to bed and your wake up time. So if you go to bed later, the stupid application will start recording you are sleeping from the original time you put. We are in 2020 and Garmin cannot fix this thing? Battery runs out about 25% each day and I have not used GPS feature at all yet! I only use the watch for training at gym (90 minutes) and Pulse Ox only during night and still... battery drops 25% each day... so at the third day, you are at about 30% ... and you must re charge it.So sleep tracking is bad and useless, the reading of your Health details is not user friendly and personally I do not know how to read the data, even if I have studied the parameters. Uneccesaarly complicated. Fitbit feeds you with nice overall insights and comments.I came from 3 years of heavy use with Fitbit Versa 1 and althouth Fitbit is now bad with its Premium Membership, I found the Versa readings and overall app (not premium) more suitable to give general and reliable Health stats.Very very disappointed. The reason why I choose to try Garmin and in particular Venu was for the geral reviews and I have missed about sleeping tracking dramatic inaccuracy, battery efficiency and the watch face (third parties) are also long to load:you turn the wrist and it takes approximately 2 seconds to make it appears. It is frustrating. That's a pity....and then... It is not difficult to put an alert regaridng drinking water and yet Garmin has not provided this simple feature... but it reminds you to move... I have been reading comments and this is something that has been suggested many months ago but Garmin does not seem caring at all... so you know what!take your Garmin device back and next time care more about your customers comments and suggestions.Heart rate is as good as Fitbit Versa 1...I am now heading back to Fitbit and maybe... maybe.... I will choose to pay the premium membership and finally having a proper Health insights... there is no point to save 50-80 dollars if then you cannot use properly a Health smartwatch...."", ""There's a lot to like about this watch. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the sleep tracking could be better automated. You have to enter your typical sleeping times but as a shift worker I don't really have typical sleep times. This means that sometimes it doesn't detect my sleep at all if I'm on nights. I feel that it should be able to detect me sleeping automatically without me having to constantly delve into the settings."", ""I love everything about this smart watch. I was a little worried it would look bulky on my 15inch thin wrist BUT it doesn't!  (Trying to upload a pic but won't let me). It is soo packed with features & the watch & apps are so easy to use! GPS is on point, as is battery life & accuracy.  Recharges super fast when needed.  Would I buy this watch again.. Definitely! Highly recommend!"", ""Shipped to Australia with no problem, fully compatible in Australia (Celsius, metres, etc. no problem).It's a great smart watch, very happy with it.It would be great if it were a little more slimline. The women's models all sacrifice screen size so it's good that these are effectively unisex watches - particularly with the colour/material selection."", ""Good functional sports' watch.  Drawbacks are that you can't see the screen in sunlight and starting the Run function at the start of a footrace is a bit hit or miss.  This may improve with practice.  Overall I'm satisfied with the product."", 'I like how it works, need to practice up on it a lot though as I get a little confused on the operating of it.  The battery does not last as long as stated, I do not do much exercise, apart from walking and it lasts for 2-3 days for me.  Otherwise I like the way it looks and the screen views.', 'Happy with the Garmin Venu, set up was easy and battery life is acceptable. The auto activity start, GPS and ability to download Spotify playlists make it a real winner. Great price on amazon, well cheaper than Australian retail stores!', 'Bought it for my husband.  He loves it. Wears it everyday.  He experiments with different watch faces. Always checking the data ( ie distance walked etc). It alerts him to text messages and phone calls.

Très déçue', 'There used to be a few of this type of watch on the market, but don’t see so many these days, this is aimed at the children’s market.First impressions are a rather large smart watch, I’ve taken a picture to compare this to my apple watch and the PTHTECHUS Smart Watch for Kids is very big.The watch seems to be okay, the screen is touch and reactions very well and is nice and clear.The built in camera quality is poor, grange images, the video is no better.You can add MP3 files for music, but this does seem a very dated thing to do, I couldn’t find bluetooth which would have been better for music etc.The time is very accurate, there are a couple different watch faces and they all look really good.Charges via USB, cable included, no charger.I do like this, it could be better, but as a simple basic watch its okay, as a smart watch it needs to be smarter, children are more switched on and they are going to be underwhelmed by the lack of bluetooth and advanced features.', ""My grandson has tested this PTHTECHUS smart  watch over a period of seven days -and I have overseen it!First the immediate and the size of the face is perhaps a little large for a child's wrist. That said itcertainly measured up in other areas. It is a touch screen and the images are crystal clear. The featuresare responsive on screen so no problem with that point.The camera pictures are somewhat disappointing and the video aspect is similar.You are able to load MP3 files and although that may be viewed as dated -it gives the youngsterthe opportunity to play music.There are also games which is a nice feature.There is no Bluetooth unfortunately but to be balanced about this there are limits to what isavailable for the cost.The fact that you can change the screen image to suit is really good.I echo another reviewers comment about children being tech savvy -they certainly are and willpick up if a product is lacking.Overall, this is a good smart watch, but lacks finesse in certain aspects. To be fair for the cost andwhat you get it is fine."", ""This is a nice smart watch for kids.It is available in three colours. I have got the black coloured watch, which is more suitable for a 11 year old. Whereas, the other two colours (pink & blue) are more suitable for young kids, in my opinion.The user manual included is very helpful indeed.A micro-USB cable is in the box.The watch charges in a reasonable time.The Video & Camera quality is just basic.It does remind me of the early mobile cameras.But still fun for kids to have a camera in the watch.Sound quality of the media player is pretty good. Better than what I expected in kids' watches. It is easy to navigate other options when the music still plays in the background, which is a good feature to have.Watch display is good.There are different clock faces to choose from, based on age groups.There is a Torch on one side above the power button. It can be turned On/Off from the options menu.It would make a nice gift for kids.But the price of £34.90 is slightly high."", 'I already have an all singing and dancing smart watch but it is black and it doesn’t allow me to change straps so I don’t feel it looks very feminine when I am dressed up to go out for any special occasion.  This pink watch fits my adult wrist perfectly well and as I don’t t need to make phone calls with it I haven’t added a SIM card which also means that I don’t have to download an app and connect the watch to my phone.  This means that the watch can still do a lot of things without me being tethered to my phonelike my usual smart watch is.  This watch is perfect for young adults and teenagers as it features a few nice watch faces and has a touch screen.  It can have music added to it as well as photos so I think there is a lot of value for money where this smart watch is concerned.  The watch itself looks amazing on my wrist and is very comfortable too.  I really think this watch is good value for money as a starter smart watch but it isn’t just a basic watch so I think any teen would be delighted with what it can do.', 'Most children love watches especially if they see adults wearing them.

The integrated phone works, it requires a specific sim card from SpeedTalk, it's a very simple but effective way to keep tabs on your child.

Man muss sich natürlich hierbei bewusst werden, dass der Funktionsumfang als auch die Qualität nicht besonders herausragend ist, so ist sicherlich die Kameraqualität sehr niedrig, Aber das Wichtigste ist, dass man einfach telefonieren kann und auch erreichbar ist und dass man auf die Uhrzeit gucken kann.

Se nota que no es resistente al agua. Yo no lo acercaría a cualquier humedad, porque tiene varios agujeros en la estructura (como para el altavoz) que tienen contacto directo con la batería, así que hay que tener ese cuidado. La pulsera es de silicona y es bastante cómoda. En tamaño, en un niño de cuatro años, es enorme, pero no queda del todo mal y mi hijo no se molesta en llevarlo puesto.Viene con el reloj su manual y un cable de carga micro usb. Para cargarlo, tienes que destapar el puerto que está en el lateral izquierdo del reloj. Para acceder al sitio donde pones la tarjeta sim, abres la parte trasera del reloj y quitas la batería. Es bastante sencillo hacerlo. Coge la señal muy rápido y en las llamadas, se escucha bien (si no hay mucho ruido cerca) y la otra persona también escucha bastante bien cuando hablas desde el reloj. Tienes la opción de añadir contactos con dibujos que ayudan mucho al niño a identificar quien es, aunque no sepa leer. Hay un padre, una madre, un abuelo, una abuela, entre otros personajes fáciles de identificar. Está genial por si el niño quiere hacer él una llamada usando los contactos. También tiene un botón de SOS al que puedes asignar un contacto para que llame.El reloj viene con una cámara frontal muy sencillita (seguramente con calidad VGA o poco más) y como está en la muñeca, es muy dificil sacar una foto tipo selfie que se aproveche porque está demasiado cerca. Mi hijo está encantado con ella, que es lo importante. Además, también tiene en el lateral derecho una linterna que la puedes encender en los ajustes y esa sí tiene una orientación que está genial si llevas el reloj en la mano izquierda, porque se queda señalando delante y tiene bastante brillo, la verdad.Como funciones interesantes, tiene lo tipico de cronómetro, despertador, cuenta atrás, pero también tiene muchas cosas que ese tipo de relojes no tienen como: calculadora, varios juegos que están muy bien (aunque chupan la batería super rapido) , grabadora de voz y otras cosas. TambiénHablando de la batería, en el primer dia, no duró nada porque el niño pasó todo el tiempo jugando con la cámara, con los juegos, y aún así después de unas tres horas, tenía unos 50% aún, pero hay que tener en cuenta que no llevaba tarjeta sim aún, porque aún no queremos que lo lleve de continuo. Supongo que durará un día entero bien con la sim puesta, pero no creo que dure más que eso. Es un reloj para cargar todos los días.Creo que es una buena opción para tener alguna manera de contactar a un niño sin darle un móvil en la mano, ya que internet es un ambiente muy complicado para niños tan pequeños. De momento, nos parece interesante como alternativa al móvil.', 'Bewertet wird hier die Smartwatch von PTHTECHUS, welche von dem Hersteller als Smartwatch für Kinder beworben wird.Mitgeliefert wird neben der Uhr noch ein Ladekabel.Die Uhr ist komplett us Kunststoff und hat ein Silikonarmband.Als erstes muss ich sagen, das die Smartwatch recht klobig ist.In meinen Augen zu klobig für einen Kinderarm.Ich würde sie als passend für meinen Arm einstufen.An dem Arm eines 6 jährigen Jungen wirkt sie viel zu klobig.Schaltet man die Uhr das erste mal ein, erscheint der Schriftzug ""Hello"" und eine kurze Melodie ertönt.Unter Einstellungen muss die Sprache erst einmal auf Deutsch gestellt werden - Lieferzustand ist Englisch.Auch wenn man Deutsch als Systemsprache gewählt hat, bleiben z. B. die Anleitungen zu den Spielen auf Englisch und werden nicht übersetzt.Die Spiele selbst sind optisch und akustisch sehr einfach gehalten und nicht vergleichbar mit Spielen für ein Smartphone.Die Steuerung geschieht mit antippen des Bildschirmes. Wischgesten werden in den Spielen nicht unterstützt.Die beiden Kameras schießen Bilder in VGA und die aufgenommenen Fotos erinnern von der Qualität her an die ersten Handykameras.Es gibt einen Video Player und einen Musikplayer. Mitdiesen kann man auf der SD Card Musik anhören.Weiterhin ist eine Taschenlampe, welche im Menü als Fackel bezeichnet wird, eingebaut.Um die Telefonfunktion nutzen zu können, muss selbstverständlich eine Sim Karte eingelegt werden.Leider kann ich die Smartwatch von PTHTECHUS nicht empfehlen.Zum einen ist sie für Kinderarme zu klobig, zum anderen scheint die verbaute Technik veraltet.Auch die Englischen Spielübersetzungen, welche sich nicht übersetzen lassen, sind ein Ausschlusskriterium, da kleinere Kinder noch kein Englisch verstehen.Natürlich handelt es sich hier um ein Produkt für unter 40 Euro, allerdings taugt die Uhr nicht wirklich als Smartwatch, da auf Bluetooth oder Wifi verzichtet wurde.', 'Für knapp 40,00 Euro eine Smartwatch zu bekommen in die man sogar eine Nano-Sim einsetzen kann und die nicht mit einem Smartphon gekoppelt werden muss nicht schon der Hammer.Das Silikonarmband ist weich und angenehm zu tragen, die gesamte Uhr grade einmal 40 Gramm schwer.Neben vorinstallierten Spielen gibt es auch eine Reihe nützlicher Apps, wie einem Rechner, eine Kamera und eine Taschenlampe. Man kann Musik abspielen und sogar Videos, Kontakte speichern, Telefonieren und Radio hören.Die Selfie Kamera wird sicher das Highlight werden!Als Besonderheit gibt es eine S.O.S Taste falls das Kind mal in Schwierigkeiten kommen sollte und schnell jemanden anrufen muss.Der 400 Milliampere große Akku wird wohl nicht ewig halten, aber das hängt ja auch vom Spieltrieb des Nutzers ab. Geladen wird die Uhr über ein Micro-USB -Kabel welches der Lieferung beigelegt ist.auf die Zugabe eines Netzteils wurde verzichtet.Da ich diese Smartwatch nicht in erster Linie als wirkliche Vertreterin ihrer Art ansehe sondern als Mittel die Kinder frühzeitig an die moderne Art der Kommunikation heranzuführen, vergebe ich trotz einiger, bei diesem Preis auch zu erwartenden Schwächen volle 5 Sterne.Eine Nano-Sim kann man auch gleich mitbestellen unter:amazon.de/WhatsApp-SIM-Prepaid-Micro-SIM-Nano-SIM/dp/B00KPPNBWEMit dieser Karte haben wir gute Erfahrungen gemacht.', 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Este reloj está pensado para ese limbo de edad entre 4 años y 12, en los que los niños son demasiado pequeños para comprarles un teléfono móvil, pero también queremos tenerlos de cierta forma localizados.Tiene un tamaño considerable para la muñeca de un niño, y esto es debido a su pantalla, que es bastante grande, y táctil, con una respuesta correcta.Tiene 1 ranura en el lateral izquierdo que es donde se encuentra la ranura microUSB, recubierta por una goma, y en el lado derecho encontramos la linterna y el botón de encendido y apagado (y SOS)).Tiene ranura para tarjeta SIM, que deberemos introducir retirando la carcasa trasera del reloj (y que a mí personalmente me ha resultado algo complicado).Tiene varias opciones interesantes como un reproductor de música, despertador, las opciones de tematización, la opción de linterna (situada en el lateral, como ya hemos comentado) y una opción con 7 juegos que viene preinstalados,  para tenerlos entretenidos.Personalmente, y si me permitís opinión, me parece bien que se permita el uso fuera de casa por la opción de llamadas y tener al enano controlado, pero dejar a un niño de este rango de edades, vía libre para disponer de este tipo de dispositivos me parece un atentado a su desarrollo emocional y cognitivo.Para ponérselo en momentos puntuales como digo, sí.Para un continuo para que esté entretenido, no lo recomiendo.Y que conste que esta opinión no tiene que ver en sí con el producto, que es correcto como digo para la edad indicada.', ""It amazes me how far technology has come in certain segments of the market.  This is a wrist-wearable computer with a built in fully independent cell phone, camera, video recorder, video player, music player and basic games console.  How they can fit all that in something this small and sell it for under 50 dollars is astounding and something I think most people take for granted.As a smart watch aimed at kids there's not much to complain about here.  It tells the time, has lots of fun things to do and as I said, it is in fact a self-contained cell phone, so you can reach your child by calling them and they can call home in an emergency.  However, it did not work with my sim card which is on the Public Mobile network.The music player is fun and the built in speaker is quite loud for a watch, but there is no bluetooth, so using this to listen to music through headphones is not possible.  The camera quality is bad and the lens' field of view is extremely narrow, but small kids will probably think this is amazing.  The manufacturer claims it takes HD photos.  It doesn't.  It takes very tiny photos with a resolution of 240x240 pixels. The display is more responsive than I expected at this price and it's bright too.  The games are very simple but 5 year olds will love them and find them easy to learn.I love that there is no setup process, no need to create an account, pair to a phone or download an app in order to use this.

Concretamente, el fabricante recomienda que la franja de edad potencialmente usuario de este producto la sitúa entre los cuatro y los doce años.En cuanto a su calidad de materiales, teniendo en cuenta su precio algo inferior cuarenta euros, he de decir que, a pesar de que atesora robustez, considero que la calidad de su correa es algo mejorable. Fabricada en silicona, he de decir que a esta correa tiene una elasticidad mejorable, aspecto este que acaba penalizando en la comodidad de este smartwatch.Tratándose de un smartwatch infantil, ofrece divertidas e interesantes funciones como juegos, calculadora, medidor de pasos e incluso una función SOS.Posee una pantalla táctil a color, con buena visibilidad y sensibilidad. En cuanto a su visibilidad, he de decir que se ha comprobado a cualquier momento del día, gracias en parte a su brillo y contraste de calidad.Permite la inserción de una SIM, haciendo que puedan realizarse llamadas. Ahora bien, el fabricante indica que esta SIM solo admite la red 2G, aspecto que ya limita su funcionalidad.En cuanto a su autonomía, llegando a durar su batería interna poco menos de un día antes de requerir una nueva recarga, he de criticar que el fabricante haya escogido para su recarga la utilización de una obsoleta entrada microUSB, formato que hoy día ya se encuentra en desuso.En cuanto a mi experiencia de uso, he de decir que su manejo es sencillo e intuitivo, a pesar de que el fabricante ha incluido el español entre los idiomas disponibles de su manual de instrucciones.El menú, colorido y vistoso, funciona de forma fluida, sin lags.Por todo lo comentado, teniendo en cuenta el precio de este smartwatch y el tipo de usuario al que esta destinado, considero que su funcionalidad es correcta, haciendo que su manejo sea fluido a la vez que divertido para los más peques, aunque destaco que tienen algunos aspectos a mejorar.', 'Bastante entretenido ha sido, para un mi sobrino de 9 años tener esto en sus manos, pues parece que le ha visto más su lado de juegos.

De hecho en 2025 se producirá el apagón total de las mismas, con lo que los dispositivos que utilizan aun hoy estas redes se verán totalmente inutilizados e inservibles.Este reloj permite utilizar una SIM pero sólo funciona bajo Red 2G, por lo que sus funciones como teléfono tienen como limitación la existencia de cobertura de esta red en su zona de uso y en 2025 dejara de funcionar dicha red, quedando por tanto únicamente funcionales desee esa fecha el resto de características del reloj:Linterna, calculadora, juegos, reproductor de mp3, cámara, podómetro…Quitando ese problema, es por sus aplicaciones y por la pantalla táctil de 1.44 pulgadas a todo color, donde el reloj destaca bastante, y se ve francamente práctico.En cuanto a autonomía, tiene una batería interna de 400mAh, que se carga mediante conexión micro USB. Se adjunta un cable USB tipo A a micro USB para este fin, pero no el transformador de corriente.Mi valoracion es de 3⭐, por la limitación en cuanto a usar la red 2G, y por el hecho de que no parece un reloj demasiado resistente al agua.

È arrivato in una scatolina piuttosto misera e, a mio parere, non adatta ad un prodotto del genere... Seppur specificato che è uno smartwatch per bambini avrei preferito una confezione più presentabile e tendente al mondo tech anche in merito ad un ipotetico regalo da fare... In tal senso devo dire che non ci siamo. Aprendo la confezione troviamo lo smartwatch, un cavetto micro usb per la ricarica, un manuale utente multilingua, italiano compreso e, in fine, un talloncino indicante il custom service. Al tatto il dispositivo si presenta ben realizzato anche se la qualità dei materiali è molto semplice ma c'è comunque da tenere a mente l'importo a cui viene proposto. Il cinturino, in silicone, è morbido e abbastanza comodo al polso. Lo smartwatch ha un design tutto sommato semplice e squadrato con un quadrante abbastanza grande e un diaplay altrettanto generoso e di discreta fattura... Il touch non è male, me lo aspettavo peggio. Sui lati troviamo la porta micro usb per la ricarica della batteria integrata da 400mah, un sensore e un tasto SOS che funziona solo se inseriamo sul retro dello smartwatch una sim in formato nano. Per accedere al suddetto vano sim va rimosso lo sportellino sul retro dove troviamo anche una piccola cassa audio. Per ciò che riguarda le funzionalità lo trovo piuttosto basico e adatto al pubblico dei più piccoli ma tenderei a partire da un età di almeno 6 anni viste le diverse funzionalità disponibili. Abbiamo l'orario ovviamente, con diversi quadranti da poter scegliere, poi abbiamo la sveglia, contapassi, calendario, giochi, registratore vocale, musica, video e persino una piccola fotocamera posta in alto sul display... Avevo dimenticato di citarla prima. Non è un granché, sia chiaro, ma mia figlia si diverte comunque. Stesso discorso vale anche per il contapassi che ad ogni lieve spostamento calcola passi di massa.. È sicuramente un device senza troppe pretese ma che funziona piuttosto bene per i più piccoli. La batteria dura un paio di giorni e credo sia un buon risultato. Il rapporto qualità prezzo lo trovo giusto e in linea con ciò che offre questo prodotto anche se la disponibilità di un coupon sarebbe sicuranente gradita"", 'Los smart watch de niños son aparentemente como los de adultos pero no: están especialmente pensados para ellos: para los padres, que se los pongan a sus hijos y se encuentren más relajados. Porque así tendrán controlados a los menores allá donde vayan.Este reloj inteligente es de un color azul vistoso, una pantalla que se ve bastante bien y queda un poco grande en los niños pequeños (a uno de 12 años le queda mejor que a uno de 4 años). Es divertido para ellos porque les encanta cacharrear con la tecnología y tiene para hacer fotos o vídeos, juegos, podómetro, temporizador, linterna, despertador, calculadora y hasta música.Pero vayamos con las características que tiene para los padres: puedes meter una tarjeta sim (que no viene incluida) para tener controlado al menor y poder llamarle o que él te llame, incluso un botón de socorro que al final acabará activando el niño sin darse cuenta alguna vez que otra sin darse cuenta, pero no está de más. Así los papás estarán tranquilos. Me parece interesante la opción de que durante las horas de clase se pueda desconectar para que los niños no se entretengan con los juegos. Aún así, las llamadas de emergencia seguirán funcionando.No hace falta bajarse ninguna aplicación ni tener que llevarlo junto a un móvil, por lo que es una ventaja con respecto a los relojes inteligentes tradicionales. La sim va en el propio reloj por lo que no hay que darle un móvil a tu hijo. Se conecta al ordenador por la entrada USB y así se transfieren las fotos, vídeos y música. Se pueden guardar hasta 10 contactos para que ellos también tengan a mano una agenda telefónica.La batería no dura mucho, hay que ir cargándola bastante más que otros relojes que he tenido, aunque depende de lo que se use.

Even with pulseox turned off and minimal notifications etc.. it got nowhere near the advertised 5 days.Worse yet is when you go for an exercise.

The problem I had was that an activity automatically starts when you walk for 10mins or more (this can be adjusted in settings) then the screen will freeze and there is no reset button so you can only reset the watch by plugging it in to charge.

I borrowed a charger from a friend to see if it was an issue with the charger or the watch itself and it seems it was the charger.When I spoke to a customer service representative from Amazon they said they could not send out a replacement charger and could only refund me ~ $10 so that I could purchase a replacement charger myself. However replacement chargers are $40 so it doesn't cover the cost. They said the only other alternative was to send the watch back for a full refund. But sending the watch back for a full refund would also cost me money in postage and insurance not to mention it took 6 weeks for me to receive the watch in the first place so would likely be another 6 weeks to then order another watch.The representative I spoke to from Amazon was a bit rude and hostile while we were discussing options to rectify the problem. I felt they didn't make much of an effort at all to help with the situation. Just kept saying that Amazon would lose money if they were to send a replacement charger or to compensate for the cost of a new charger and that I should be grateful they were even offering a refund.

I have a fairly thin wrist but it doesn't look oversized at all.It seems to track steps pretty accurately.The battery lasts about 6-7 days for me, but I don't have it connected to bluetooth constantly and I don't have the heart rate monitor on 24/7.  I do these things only when necessary so am assuming battery would run out much quicker otherwise.The app is pretty easy to navigate.You can pick pretty much whichever clock face suits your style or design your own (with a few limitations)CONs:You can set up to three different alarms, but mine only work for about 4 days then change their own mind to vibrate whenever the watch pleases!  I only have one alarm set per day, everyday, however this watch changes to 3.30pm, 11.30pm or nothing at all despite me making no changes on the app.The watch face is changed via the app however if it is lit and you accidentally have something pressed on the face it allows you to change back to two different default faces.  This happens by accident a lot.  Simply by crossing your arms or leaning on your leg can cause the face to change - this is a pain.  You should be able to lock it or change it via the app only.You can't change the order of how you see the main functions.  I bought this to keep track of my steps but you have to scroll through other pages to see that number, it would be great if you could change the order according to your own needs.The date is only in American format, so as an Aussie you have to either find a face that doesn't put it in mm/dd/yy format or just remember it is backwards!All-in-all it's just OK.  I can't say it's great but I can't say it's bad either.  If the alarm function and locking the clock face was available it would definitely go up in my rating."", ""I don't want to start the review off with a negative comment,  so I'll say what a great little watch.

He also has activities, but given his age, I was wanting the blood pressure and oxygen levels also.

Only takes 1’5h to recharge.I personally think it looks really good considering is a “sport watch” the finishes on the sphere and the fact that is circular instead of rectangular (like in other models) gives it a bit of a more sophisticated look (I bought the pink one).App for iPhone is very user friendly and has all you you expect from it.', 'I love the large face and wide wristband and the watch has more than enough features for me.

"Amazfit Bip S Fitness Smartwatch, 40 Day Battery Life, 10 Sports Modes, Heart Rate, 1.28'' Always-On Display, Water Resistant, Built-in GPS, Carbon Black ",https://www.amazon.com.au/Amazfit-Fitness-Smartwatch-Battery-Resistant/dp/B082VZZHK4,"['Everything as advertized', 'Amazfit Bip SLá vem textão, mas acho que se você está interessado no Amazfit Bip S, pode ser útil. Comprei o modelo no dia 25/10/2020, e foi entregue como combinado, menos de uma semana depois. Nunca tive um smartwatch, embora seja um entusiasta da tecnologia há anos e acompanhe lançamentos, reviews, comparativos etc. com bastante atenção. Embora quisesse um Apple Watch desde o lançamento do primeiro modelo, com o tempo percebi que o Apple Watch entregaria para mim um conjunto muito maior de funcionalidades do que eu realmente precisaria: não me interesso por notificações de mensagens, usar um smartwatch para ouvir música, ou atender a chamadas telefônicas. Além disso, o preço de um Apple Watch (mesmo trazido de fora por algum conhecido) é muito alto para mim. Procurava, na verdade, por um smartwatch que mostrasse as horas, a data, contasse passos, tivesse GPS integrado, fizesse uma leitura minimamente precisa dos batimentos cardíacos e me permitisse mapear aspectos gerais da minha saúde, seja pelo sono, seja pelo lado das atividades esportivas. Depois de muito pesquisar, encontrei o Amazfit Bip S e gostei muito do produto até o momento. Ele é muito simples na construção e no uso, leve, tem uma tela que usa a luz ambiente para refletir os dados, gastando quase nada de bateria para fazer o que um relógio tem de fazer: mostrar os dados o tempo todo. Qualquer coisa, é só apertar o botão lateral e ele acende uma luz de fundo que ilumina os dados em qualquer situação. Falando em bateria, escrevo no 12/11/2020, ou seja, amanhã serão duas semanas com ele no pulso praticamente o tempo todo (realmente, só tenho tirado para tomar banho, e ele é à prova d’água, pois já nadei com ele numa piscina por cerca de meia-hora e não tive problemas): neste momento, a bateria está a 46%. Neste meio tempo, ele ficou ligado o tempo todo, fazendo medições automáticas de frequência cardíaca a cada 30 minutos (isto é configurável), monitorando o sono (idem), contando passos o tempo todo e conectado via bluetooth com meu iPhone (sim, funciona com iPhone sem problemas, integrado ao aplicativo Saúde, a partir do aplicativo Zepp). Ainda sobre a bateria, monitorei sete caminhadas ao ar livre de mais de uma hora de duração e uma corrida em esteira de 45 minutos com ele, além de diversas medições que fiz de frequência cardíaca por conta própria. Minha estimativa é que para o meu uso médio, eu precise carregá-lo a cada vinte dias (o que é muito bom, e conta como um grande ponto positivo do relógio para mim). Em uma das caminhadas, levei um relógio Polar com aquela fita com o sensor para colocar no peito, para comparar com a medição de batimentos do Amazfit: a medição bateu em 90% do tempo, sem grandes erros, o que - por enquanto - me indica que o frequencímetro do Amazfit é confiável, embora vá fazer outros testes com outros medidores, para ter mais informações… O GPS integrado, aliás, é bastante preciso, e não é necessário levar o telefone para mapear corridas: ao chegar em casa e sincronizar com o telefone, os dados são transferidos imediatamente. Na ergométrica, ele marcou uma distância percorrida aproximada maior do que a da esteira, mas tenho de testar outras vezes para avaliar melhor. Meu sono tem sido medido com boa precisão, com o relógio identificando zonas de sono profundo e momentos em que acordei (por exemplo, para beber água ou algo assim). A integração com o aplicativo é muito boa, e bastante simples, as atividades físicas são bem documentadas e as metas são todas configuráveis, tornando o aparelho um aliado para projetos de saúde e bem-estar. Além de tudo, mede dez tipos de atividades físicas diferentes, permite que a gente troque a aparência da tela com facilidade e bom conjunto de opções (embora eu ainda não tenha entendido porque - das cinco watchfaces padrão - só consigo trocar uma; talvez tenha comido bola em algo), é possível ter alertas de chamadas recebidas pelo telefone, assim como notificações de quase qualquer aplicativo de mensagens; ele tem um despertador que tenho usado todos os dias (ele vibra no pulso ao invés de fazer um alerta sonoro, o que tenho gostado bastante, dei adeus ao despertador do celular, ao menos por enquanto), permite que eu coloque lembretes, alem de outras funcionalidades. É isso: se você chegou até aqui, espero ter dado uma visão geral útil para ajudar em sua escolha. Em conclusão, estou muito satisfeito com o Amazfit Bip S, um smartwatch com preço acessível, fácil de usar, leve no pulso, de boa construção, com boa precisão nos sensores e dados, facilidade de uso e no acesso via aplicativo, além de uma bateria que dura - ao menos - duas semanas, num uso intenso.', 'Gostei do produto. Tomo banho com ele todo dia. GPS muito preciso. Bateria durou 10 dias com monitoramento cardíaco 1 min, uso do GPS 7 dias por 1 hora.', 'Great watch, great tracking and amazing battery life. Can see the screen in the sunlight and it just works as it should do. Awesome.', 'This is a very good Smart Activity Watch with a few limitations. It should fit most user’s needs. Listed below are a few items which work well and which do not1. Heart Rate Sensor - Better:The heart rate sensor is very good and does a good job doing continuous monitoring.2. GPS Tracking - Best :The GPS tracking is very accurate and connects real fast.3. Battery Life- The Best: Even with continuous heart rate, GPS and notifications turned on, the watch has amazing battery life. It’s only been a week since I started using it and still have 66%4. Sleep Monitoring - Average:The sleep monitoring is not its strong suite. It’s does a good job tracking at night. But any naps or day time sleeps are not recorded. There is no manual option either to record it. Huami released an update for their premium smart watches but nothing yet for Amazfit bip or Bip S5. Workout Modes- Good:I did not try out all the work out modes but cycling/running/ jogging work well and gives you good data6. Watch Faces - Better:It has really good collection of watch faces within the app and also 3rd party watch faces. Considering this is not on Apple or Google eco systems it’s good to know it has such developer base.7. Display- Good:The display is good and works well in all lighting conditions. Works best under direct sunlight.  Of course it’s not super bright like an AMOLED.8. Notifications- Good:The notifications options are good and works for most users. Calls/texts/WhatsApp/Email/ Calendar work well. Personally I did not want all app notifications on my watch. It can get annoying. But if you are looking for more control on app notifications this watch may not be the right choice9. Amazfit App - Good:The app is good and gives a nice summary of all the key dat- HR/ Steps/ Calories/ Sleep. The drill down and details are also there. However, the app can do a better job being more intuitive with detailed information.Overall this watch is very good for someone looking for a above average activity tracker with decent smart watch functions. Hard to find another with equal amount of features and functionality in the same price bracket or even more.', 'Para quem faz exercícios, a bateria não dura os 40 dias anunciados, mas sim uns 15 dias, o que para mim já é o suficiente!Muito bom! Vale o investimento!', 'Great budget running / keep fit watch with a lot of battery life !! Simple', 'Does the job brilliant battery life easy to use once set up for exercise and fitness tracking it perfect.', 'Returned this 2 weeks ago and have had no confirmation of receipt of the item.', 'I apologize for this long review! But if you are very interested in this watch and are about to pull the trigger, please read on so that you make an informed decision.I just needed a cheap fitness tracker / smartwatch to count my steps and help me stay in shape during the pandemic. This seemed to be the one.  I had to weigh the Pros and Cons vs other fitness trackers, and it came down to the Bip S and the Bip U Pro.  Both the Bip S and Bip U Pro have GPS, which was a main requirement for me for biking and walking.  However, the U Pro has a higher resolution LCD screen, but it is not easy to see outdoors and also its higher resolution leads to a lower battery life AND no always-on display (AOD).  The AOD is a convenience because you don\'t have to keep touching the watch or twisting the wrist to activate the display.  This especially becomes important when you’re biking and want to see your workout stats in real-time.  The Bip S, on the other hand, has unrivalled battery life, an always-on transflective display, and can very easily be seen outdoors, even in sunny weather. These were the deal breakers for me against the Bip U Pro, so I went with the Bip S which was a few dollars cheaper as well.  (EDIT:  I’ve now discovered the Bip U Pro is boxier looking, and, it won’t show the subject in iOS notifications.  So your calendar or reminders will show the time but not the actual description of the event. That’s a showstopper to me.)The Bip S has really motivated me to stay active, and it helps when I can see the number of steps I\'ve walked, right on the watch face.Since my last full charge about 2 day ago, I am at about 84%.  This includes some biking and walking with the GPS, a few elliptical workouts, uploading of watch faces, a few manual heart-rate readings, and notifications from my phone. (EDIT: After 6 days the battery went down to 57%, but I have been using the GPS every day except for one day. On that day the battery only went down by 2-3%!)  That\'s not bad, and I don\'t need to worry about charging every other night.  Keep in mind that if you are using the GPS for about 20 minutes (cycling, running) it will use up around 4% of battery.The watch syncs with the Zepp app on iOS/Android, which is done every time you open the Zepp app.  Zepp also integrates with the Apple Health app if you connect Zepp for step tracking and heart rate monitoring.  Additionally, the app can automatically upload your workout data to the Strava social media app for cyclists/runners!For step tracking, I have to sync the watch with the Zepp app, which automatically syncs it with Apple Health.  One important thing to know is that Apple Health is able to distinguish the steps that were taken with the iPhone\'s built-in step tracker from those that were taken with the watch.  So even if you are walking with both the watch on your wrist and the iPhone in your pocket, the steps will be counted correctly after synchronizing the watch with Zepp, and you won\'t have double counts.  Just ensure in Apple Health that the Zepp app is added to the Data Sources section and is prioritized to the top of the list.  The Health app will check which steps were taken by the Bip S and then will subtract the conflicting steps that were taken at the same time by the iPhone\'s own step tracker.  I believe that\'s how it works, since it\'s been logging the correct number of steps so far in Apple Health.There are various workout modes on the watch.  You start a workout, such as biking or walking or elliptical, and it starts a timer and shows your heart rate in real time, as well as other metrics such as current speed.  This is really cool especially when you\'re biking and you can watch your heart rate go up and down.  The GPS feature during walking/biking shows the path on your watch after you are done your workout (it won\'t show the map, just the path. See the photo I included).  It\'s cute but it\'s also a nice feature to have.  When synced with the Zepp app, the app superimposes this path onto a real map of your location.  Hence, I can even leave my phone at home while I bike, while the watch\'s GPS logs my movement.  Keep in mind that the GPS is not a satellite navigation like Google Maps or Apple Maps; it just logs co-ordinates that are used later with the app, and likely also assists with calculating speed and other metrics during a workout.One really, really good thing about the workout mode is that the always-on display shows the workout activity throughout its execution.  So the screen will not go back to the home screen, and when seen outdoors during the day there’s no need to turn on the backlight either!  This contrasts with other smart watches that require you to press the button or raise your wrist to turn on the display to see the activity while you’re running.  Some watches with AMOLED always-on displays go back to the home screen during a workout too, requiring a button press to switch to the workout screen.Sleep tracking seems to be enabled all the time, because even without the heart rate monitoring enabled I noticed it detected I had slept while wearing it, and gave me some info about my sleep on the Zepp app. I then enabled heart rate detection every minute to get more accurate stats. The sleep tracker will give you info about your Light Sleep and Deep Sleep stages, although it is not without issues.  For example one night I had gotten out of bed twice and it thought I had awoken after the first time, and stopped tracking my sleep instead of continuing after I went back to bed. Otherwise it’s been fine as long as I don’t get out of bed too much and only sleep during the nighttime.  It didn’t detect a lunch-hour nap.Regarding the heart rate sensor, I thought it was not that useful to turn the monitoring on (other than during workouts), until I discovered that the PAI score relies on heart rate data. So that’s why I have turned on the heart rate checking for every minute.  There has been extensive research done for the PAI study and it seems to be a good motivator and indicator for fitness.  Other smartwatch companies are integrating the PAI analysis as well.  I’m glad it’s included in this watch.Another thing that is really handy is a reminder every hour that buzzes me to ""Get up and move"" if I\'ve been a couch potato or working too long on the PC.Overall this has been a very nice experience and now I\'m thinking of selling off all my regular watches. However, it doesn\'t mean it\'s perfect, there are various things that could be improved on.  Here are some things I observed in the first few days:1) The stopwatch and countdown timers do not show the current time of day.  On the other hand, if you use a Workout mode instead of the stopwatch,  the current time is shown at the top of the display in a small font.2) Notifications show limited information.  In a text message you won\'t see emojis, they are replaced by strange characters.  Also, for reminders or app notifications, the title is shortened.  The message body also shows limited info, although it is sufficient for short messages.3) The \'Do Not Disturb\' setting on the watch does not use the phone\'s Do Not Disturb times.  So if your phone is set to not notify during sleep hours, your watch will still alert you, unless you turn on Do Not Disturb manually on the watch.  Then you have to turn it back off in the morning.  (My watch face shows a Do Not Disturb mode indicator, so it\'s easy to know when it\'s being used.) There is also an ""Auto"" Do Not Disturb setting on the watch but it relies on the sleep tracker feature, which would require you to sleep with it.4) There are various language bugs in the watch.  One is the weather display for Tuesday, which shows up as ""Tus"" instead of ""Tue"".  A funnier bug is in the 1-kilometer alert during a Walking Workout, where it inserts a Spanish word(!) into the alert... ""Velocidad.""  See the photos I attached.5) The weather feature has a frequent bug where the first page, the one with the current weather, is missing!  A restart of the watch will not fix it.  I had to resync the watch a couple times with the Zepp app to fix it; although I think I also had to manually change the weather location.  (EDIT:  If you manually set the city rather than automatically detect it, it seems to work fine.)6) In the PAI screen there is a glitch where the text is overlapping with the numbers if you achieved your target.  Not sure how they missed that one (see the attached photo).Nonetheless, these are not major issues, but still gives you an indication the developers need better quality control.  Similar small issues are seen on the app but are not showstoppers. I have submitted bug reports for some of them, which I hope will be addressed in a future firmware update.This is really a nice watch, and at a great price.  I do wish it had a higher resolution screen though, but that’s the compromise for better battery life and always-on display.  The fact it has GPS, very good battery life and outdoor viewing is a giant plus for me.  I only really needed a watch with step tracker, but now I’m really getting into the PAI stuff which I discovered from this watch, and hence doing more workouts.  I\'m really enjoying it and my health is on its way to improving.==========UPDATE after about 5 weeks:There is a GPS bug that appears to happen every couple of weeks.  When you go on a running or cycling workout and enable the GPS, the path that gets plotted afterward is not correct.  The GPS seems to drift off somewhere else so that it shows the wrong location.  For example, the other day I cycled for about 20 minutes and then I decided to do a 180 degree turn and head back to my origin.  When I viewed the plot, somehow the GPS had drifted off about 1km north from the point I turned around.  The GPS plot of the ride back had the path shifted about 1km north.  To remedy this issue both times I had to turn off the watch and turn it back on.  It would be fine in a subsequent ride.  Perhaps a software glitch on the watch caused this.  But it looks like I will have to do a power cycle of the watch every week or so to prevent this from happening again.', '*Commentaires ""En français"" à la fin!""The only negative point of this purchase was to pay for a new product and to receive an open box!""What sets this watch apart from other smartwatches is its battery life.I really enabled all the options and the continuous heart rate monitoring, use of the GPS, ""Always On"" display and notifications and it lasts about 10 days.

It packs everything a high end watch offers but at a third of the price.I was expecting more battery life which was one of my main reasons in buying this watch, but the 8-9 day total battery life is more realistic. This is having it ON all the time to track my sleeping patterns, GPS for jogs everyday, brightness set to 75%. I also bought a cover for the watch, so overall, I'm satisfied. I use to have to charge every 2 days with my Asus Zenwatch, so it's nice I don't have to charge so periodically."", 'The advertizement that this watch achieves (or even can achieve) 40 days of use without a recharge is borderline disingenuous. My best span was 10 days with barely 2 notifications per day.If there is a secret or specific series of settings that can achieve this durability mark, it is completely opaque and unknown for us, the users. The previous generation watch got a month without recharge, out of the box.I would say in this regards the product has deteriorated in this version. I will be shopping for a different product when this one wears out.', 'Poderia ter uma pulseira mais confortável (o mesmo sistema da mi-band).  De resto é muito bom comparado ao preço.

They proposed two solutions via email which did not work, so I contacted them again, and they did the same thing. After the third email and over three hours of trying to make the watch work I gave up and threw it in the trash. I have had trouble with apple products, taken them to a store and they fixed them. With amazfit not only would they take no responsibility, they would ask me to fix it, and after spending time doing what they said, which did not work,  their only solution was to propose more futile fixes so I would spend more time trying to fix it.', ""I wore the original Bip for 2 years and was happy with the Activity and Sleep Tracking, as well as very impressed with battery life, which often lasted close to the month range. I upgraded to this Bip S, and feel like the trade-off of upgraded features, like swim tracking, with significantly worse battery life was worth it for me. Significantly worse battery life means a full charge barely lasting 10 days with daily activity tracking. Not the end of the world as a full top-up is only a couple of hours on the charger and I typically do that immediately after waking up before starting a day off.I'm happy with the Bip S at it's current sub-$100 price point. If it started to get into the $150-$200 range, I'd probably skip it though.TLDR: A good budget activity tracker despite sub-par battery life."", ""Comprei esse relógio com interesse maior para uso em atividades físicas e realmente atendeu muito bem minhas expectativas.

Carreguei até 100%, no momento que estou escrevendo isso, já se passaram 2 dias e a bateria esta em 85%, faço uso diariamente do GPS o que claro consome a bateria, mas estou satisfeito com a duração dela.No geral posso dizer que é um ótimo relógio, principalmente para quem quer usar em atividades físicas."", 'La primera carga de la bateria me duró apenas 2 semanas, lo cual es comprensible por la sincronización y actualizaciones que se hacen la primera vez.Ahora lleva 11 dias desde que lo volví a cargar y aun le queda el 50%.Es perfecto para usarlo en exteriores ya que la luz directa del sol hace que se vea mejor la pantalla.', 'The phone would not connect with the app which was extremely disappointing because I thought I finally found something budget friendly and as small as an Apple Watch for my petite wrist but DOES NOT CONNECT.  I have to return.  Don’t waste your time.I’m getting an Apple Watch', ""I am a Pebbles watch owner. Really loved my Pebbles until Fitbit bought them out and thus ended the firmware updates.This Amazfit watch is awesome. I've researched many but none really came close. One problem I initially had with it was that it froze at 7 p.m. every single night and didn't come on again until 6 a.m. even if I hit the button and it would not light up. I realized that I probably accidentally set up an option or two to automatically time out every single night from 7 p.m. till 6 a.m. one thing I do really miss is that although I can see the messages I could not reply. Which defeats the use of the watch if he can't at least reply yes or no. You still have to go to your phone to answer. One of the best features that the Pebbles watch had was that you can set up about 10 different replies. So if you're a nurse, or in a meeting and you need to send a quick reply without pulling out your phone every time you just can't do it."", ""When I received the product I charged it right away.. the battery went down to 12% between 3 to 4 weeks which was good. I was impressed. However after second charge the battery started discharging rapidly. I have to charge it once a week now.

Please don't buy it, I don't recommend."", ""after using the Amazfit watch for a few months suddenly i can't sync the watch and the workout feature.  the app won't even allow me to send in a user feedback complaint. basically it has turned into a watch.  the warranty expires in 3 months after purchase which is lame.  beware as you buyAs a follow up..a few weeks later uploads work fine perhaps there was a software issue that they were working on and didn’t inform owners of??"", ""Battery life is amazing (I get about 2 weeks out of mine/current settings) and charging is pretty quick as well.  The interface with the app is good and the app just received a major update which I like but haven't spend a lot of time navigating yet but much improved over the last version.I would recommend for the price point.  It does nearly the same amount of 'function' as a name brand without the cash investment - sleep tracking, HR, notifications (calls, texts, FB/messenger, whatsapp, calendar, other social media), alarm, sport/fitness tracking, event reminders.  Covers all the bases for me."", ""After having another FitBit die on me, I decided to give this a try. I was wary, because FitBit had so many bells and whistles, I was afraid I'd miss some of its features. Fortunately, it hasn't be an issue for me.This watch is incredible. The screen is lower-res than what I'm used to, but it's got a full always-on display, and even with all of its features enabled, I'm on week two off of a single charge and it just hit 50% battery.The only thing I don't like about it is that the alarms are very short - I live in fear of the day that I don't notice the gentle buzzing and wind up late for work. More customizable alarms would make this the best watch I've ever used. I also wish I could make notifications show on the screen for a shorter amount of time.All that aside, I haven't felt so happy with a smartwatch since the Pebble days, and FitBit is now in my rear-view mirror."", 'I love it.

Bought this watch and absolutely love this UMIDIGI Urun. The packaging was impressive. First of all, it's easy to set up and great battery life. Comfortable to wear. The touch screen is very responsive and fingerprint resistant with 4 changeable dial setting. Call & Text notification, Facebook notification work well, however, Facebook messenger notification only worked for a couple of days in my phone. The watch has different17 sport mode to track fitness activity and provide heart rate reading, Oxygen level, Sleep tracking, weather and you even use to control music in your phone. Other useful features are flashlight, alarm, compass, timer, stopwatch and find.The magnetic charger is not strong enough and gets disconnected easily.Overall, GOOD VALUE PRODUCT"", 'The build quality of this watch is quite nice (metal frame with glass screen). The screen is quite responsive and viewability under direct sun light is adequate.The watch came pre-charged  at about 60%. Charging was completed to 100% in 40mins. I have set the watch to continuously to monitor heart rate and the battery sits at about 90% after a day from full charge. The step counter seems to match that of my other devices and connectivity to my android device was fairly simple to configure.Overall I am satisfied with my purchase. Its a great entry level watch with heart rate, gps, sports modes and connectivity to android. I would recommend this product!', 'First off, the unboxing experience is just like unboxing a high end smartphone, with precise & solid packaging.The aluminium frame is really nice, while the glass watch face has an amazing oleophobic coating, which means that water runs right off it, or beads up and all is needed is to tilt the watch and it instantly becomes dry. The buttons are tactile but not clicky, which is great. The band has the appearance of smooth leather, with UMIDIGI text on the buckle, with plenty of holes for adjustment.The display itself has a decent resolution, while the viewing angles are amazing (particularly for an LCD display), which has 3 backlight brightness levels, and it\'s bright enough to see it clearly when outdoors. The screen responds well, with smooth animations. However, the animations only activate after your finger has left the screen, but I guess there are reasons for that (to use less battery, or avoid accidental swipes, for example).The step counting is very overstated, and the sleep tracking isn\'t perfect, but seems to be getting better. It does show deep sleep though, which my fitness tracker (costing 2× more) does not.The activity tracking works quite well, tracking location & distance with reasonable accuracy (but messing up when you\'re not travelling). Some activities didn\'t show the full route on the app, but the distance was much higher than the route was showing.The heart rate and SPO2 monitoring works really well.A full charge of the battery only lasted me just over 5 days, which is less than expected but better than a high end smartwatch. I only had 24/7 HR monitoring enabled on the first day, and occasionally connected it to the app, with some activity tracking on 2 days.The instructions are minimal, but after getting used to the watch and its functions, it\'s straight forward.The Paiactive app works decently well, but can take forever to load the device settings. It also uses significant amounts of battery, even with app closed and Bluetooth turned off, and having the battery optimisation turned on in Android settings. Despite this, it says that the app has been in active use, and continues to increase ""active use"". I\'ve had to disable the app in background to prevent it from draining my phone\'s battery.I updated both types of the software (system version & resource version) when I started using the watch on December 31, so I\'m hoping that these issues can be fixed in future updates, as the watch is very good hardware wise.', 'I bought this watch with some reservation. I was intending to pair it with my iPhone. Knowing apples reputation for to being very compatible I was a bit concerned. Turned out my reservations were correct. Notifications get pushed through to the watch so often that it is downright annoying. The notifications don’t even align with those coming up on the phone.My partner has a Umidigi phone so we tested with that and it functions properly without the over the top notifications so it’s definitely an apple pairing issue rather than the watch.The other big issue for me is that the watch is too large for a female. It is wearable however the watch face is large and just doesn’t look or feel right.', ""I'm an Android user and unfortunately, right now, it seems there is only the official app that supports this device.This app is really unstable & incomplete. It seems more like an Alpha version. Fingers Cross for a future update.It's a shame because the device seems nice and good quality.I hope someone else will make a different app and enable more options.But hey, in the end, it's 60$ product, but I'll be back to Mi Band."", ""Wrong time on watch. Auto time & date on mobile.  Changed to manual date & time. Reset phone & watch. Still 30 minutes out on the time. Did Google search for solutions. Nothing!It's a darn shame because the rest of the features work fine.BUT a watch is no good if it shows wrong time."", 'I found the watch easy to set up and connect with my phone. I have tested most of the health functions and they seem responsive to changes, I cannot accertain the accuracy of the values but they seem to make sense. The music skip function works and so does the remote camera shutter, ""find my phone"" and the various notifications I have tested so far. I am yet to try out the GPS on a run but I am happy with my purchase so far! The bezels are quite big and there are not that many watch faces to choose from but the watch met my expectations!', 'The quality is good. The app and features needs a lot of improvement. It does not even show battery life remaining. i.e. battery status.The steps counter and the sleep hours are very in accurate. Around 30% in accurate. These are features I bought the watch for.I would like a refund on the watch. Please arrange for this to happen.', 'I love the look of this watch. Had a few issues with the time at the start, but I contacted the seller via Amazon and they fixed it with an update. Bluetooth drops out easily, needs to have longer range.', 'A very poor product overall.  It was very difficult to connect to the app, and then the app itself was very poor (poor connectivity to the device).  The watch cannot be used properly without the app.  Until the app is improved considerably, I would not consider buying this product.  When we finally logged on to the app, it suggested the app software be updated with the latest release.  We followed the instructions and it ""bricked"" the watch.', 'Battery life says up to 10 days but my battery only lasts 2.5/3 daysInstructions are not clear on how to link things such as music or the camera which seems to be features and option available on the watch.But everything else it does it perfect.It is water proof, the message option and call visibility is great. Love the exercise, steps oxygen,blood pressure counts and features', 'Have been this smart watch for over a week now. It it a very good workout tracker. I have included workouts from the the free software used on android phone. You can run with just the watch as GPS is built into the watch. Battery lasted well over a week as well.', 'Watch is performing as described. The one issue  that the one I purchased has, is that the step counter is not any where accurate. It measures  steps too quickly. This seems to be a problem with most smart watches but this one can jump 30-40 steps with a movement of the wrist. I reduce my step count for the day by  200-300 steps to allow for inaccuracy.', 'The app this watch uses will not let me register so I cannot connect my iPhone to the watch.

The watch does an amazing job at tracking fitness activity like heart rate, steps, oxygen levels, calories and other fitness metrics and has great data tracking. The app is great and easy to use. The touch screen is responsive, clear, bright and fairly scratch and fingerprint resistant. Another great feature is the ability to control music very easily. Other useful features include changeable watch faces, text and call notifications, alarm, weather, and camera shutter. The build quality is good, presentation/packaging is good. The battery life is surprisingly exceptional and the Bluetooth connection is very good with zero dropouts. Now there are a few cons, the camera shutter is only a shutter it does not display the image from the phone onto the watch, the watch band material is okay, but I would get replacement watch bands, there is no NFC thus I cannot use google pay from the watch, bigger bezels and less screen in comparison to rivals, and lastly the magnet of magnetic charger is not very strong and may become disconnected with small movements of the watch or charging wire.', 'Bought this to replace a Honor Band.

Easy set up, excellent battery life as advertised. This watch has become my best workout buddy!  The workmanship is very good. It has a built in compass to show me the directions if I am ever lost.

It's very comfortable,The low weight design is ideal for work outs. I some times forget that its around my hand. Pretty cool fitness tracker at a very affordable price. Overall I am really happy with this smart watch."", ""I have a UMIDIGI Android smartphone also purchased from Amazon. This smartwatch has some neat features such as blood pressure, oxygen level, and heart rate monitor which seem to work well. At first I was able to pair the watch and phone and use the Paiactive app to connect with Strava to view GPS data of a recent walk. It all looked accurate, and Strava was able to export a GPX file which could then be used in Garmin Basecamp and Google Earth.Unfortunately, when it came time to reconnect the watch and phone I wasn't successful although the phone said they were connected, but the watch and the Paiactive app said they were not connected. I don't know what sequence (watch first or second, phone Bluetooth on/off) would have proven successful. It could have been much more user friendly, especially between two products of the same company, UMIDIGI.I usually run in the early morning six or so days a week when it is dark, and I depend on a smartwatch to monitor/view my heart rate. I also wear glasses to see properly. Unfortunately I found the numbers on the watch face too small to read my heart rate and there doesn't seem a way to illuminate the dial. Walking in the daylight wearing glasses should work for most users like me as would wearing it around the house or casually.This UMIDIGI  smartwatch certainly looks good, seems well made, and the price is excellent; however, for my needs it falls short and the challenge in pairing isn't helpful."", ""UnpackingThe box containing the UMIDIGI SMARTWATCH Urun black.I find the specific codes for the Umidigi brand with the choice of the packaging box and the presence of the brand.Umidigi may be a small manufacturer, but they are quite consistent in their packaging.The box contains the watch, a big manual and a cable to recharge the watch.First configurationThe Umidigi Urun does not require any special configuration. In a few clicks, the watch is fully operational, all you have to do is connect it to a smartphone and download Paiactive apk to use its features .I didn't have to do a firmware update like with the Huawei Active GT which had to reboot 9 times before getting the right firmware.FinishThe Umidigi Urun is not a premium smartwatch, Umidigi has clearly targeted small budgets by offering a smartwatch at this price.Small price often rhymes with poor finish, but this is far from being the case with Urun model . The smartwatch is made of plastic but at no time did I have the impression to have a poor quality product around my wrist.The Urun can be controlled from the touch screen in combination with the two large buttons on the right. You don't have to read the manual to master the Urun, the menus are quite logical.You can charge the watch with magnetized cable and is naturally placed on the connector of the watch.ConnectivityThe Urun connects through Bluetooth with the smartphone. It is accessible on any bluetooth phone, so you don't need to buy an Umidigi phone to use it.Battery rangeThe Urun has an autonomy of 2 weeks if you don't do any sport. If, on the other hand, you practice sport on a daily basis using the watch's tracking, I get an autonomy between 7 and 9 days.Screen qualityThe display of the Urun is surprisingly good for this price range. It offers good contrast, everything is perfectly readable even the smallest characters.The display has a good brightness that will allow you to use the watch in almost all conditions and doesn`t have automatic brightness.The display can be customized directly from the watch, you can choose from 4 different types of display.You will find the following features:- time- monitoring of number of steps, calories,sleep monitoring, SpO2,BP, weather and heart rate- 17 sport modes (Run,Walk,Cycle,Treadmill,Bike,etc)- reading incoming messages (SMS only)- alarmclock configurated from the Paiactive apk- flashlight.compass, find your phone and shutter for your phone camera- timer, stopwatch- control playing your music stored on your phoneHeart rate monitoringThe Urun allows you to monitor your heart rate but and offer continuous monitoring. You can see your heart rate in real time when you access the feature on the watch, you will also see the highest and lowest heart rate of the day. However,you will see graphs showing the evolution of your heart rate throughout the day on the Paiactive apk.The heart rate values are quite close to what I get with a Mi Band 4, these values are quite close to reality with a maximum deviation of 5 to 10%.Sleep dataThe Urun allows you to monitor your sleep by dividing the data into 3 categories: deep sleep, light sleep and wake-up times.I don't know if these data are credible because each watch seems to make different calculations. So far, all the watches I've tested indicate that I have a deep sleep deficit, with the Urun it's the opposite. Who is right? I don't know.CompatibilityThe Urun can in principle be used with any bluetooth compatible smartphone that can use the Paiactive application.I tested it with several phones (Xiaomi,Motorola,Nubia,Umidigi) and it worked every time."", ""El reloj  es bastante funcional. Siento que las estimaciones de frecuencia, oxígeno, sueño y actividad son bastante cercanas a la realidad, y hasta te alerta cuando tu frecuencia cardiaca es muy alta.

El diseño es discreto y elegante.Solo le veo algunos detalles:1. Principalmente la duración de la batería.

Own a few pairs from other major manufacturers. First and foremost the umidigi Urun is built with quality in mind, even though it's a budget priced watch.

Another great feature is the built in GPS that most others would charge Atleast 3 times more with. The heartrate and sleep tracker seems to work accuratelyThe watch screen is vivid, large, and responsive. Also the battery life is well into premium brand territory. Overall I would give this watch 10/10 for value and features."", 'I bought this hoping to have a basic smartwatch to wear that I wouldn\'t be afraid of destroying, something to replace my 4 year old Fitbit... Unfortunately this is not that...  Well it is a basic smart watch there are way too many flaws with this to be considered viableFirst and the biggest negative is the fact that the app (Paiactive) is not available in the Google Play store and needs to be side loaded... that is a huge red flag for security reasons at a minimum.  Once the app is loaded it is extremely slow, unresponsive and buggy, and continually asks to allow background battery usage.As for the watch it is decent but has some issues as well: The touch screen is way too sensitive to the point where wearing it under a sweater will continually cause the screen to be turned on and even activate ""buttons""  I had it activate find my phone mode a couple times, screen background changes etc.This smartwatch does not use Bluetooth LE and requires an ""active"" Bluetooth connection at all timesThe smart notifications are unusable, while only having ""phone and messages"" notifications turned on within the app I was getting near constant notifications for everything and anything... Including notifications that my phone was charging every time the percentage changed.The sleep tracking was totally wrong as well, I am a shift worker and we\'ll working a 12 hour night shift it counted me as asleep from 11pm to 4am on multiple nights yet didn\'t track my sleep while I was actually asleep.About the only good thing about this watch is the battery life, in the 2 weeks I have had this watch I have only had to charge it twice.I have never sent anything back before and unfortunately this will be the first thing.  I can\'t get past the negatives to keep it. I will be ordering a higher end watch.', 'Just got the watch yesterday! Already have a umidigi S5 Pro phone which i really like, so i thought i would try their watches.  I like the size, configuration pretty simple.  The app downloaded no problem and i was able to easily configure the watch.  Ive had a few positive comments from people seeing the watch on my wrist.  Im happy so far! would prefer a few more choices of time screens and still learning to use all the features.  Found that the remote camera operation only seems to work with the downloaded app and not your other camera apps on the phone but maybe im missing something.  All in all i would recommend for the price.Revised ReviewI like the watch but there is absolutely no support. Amazon says contact umidigi for warranty issues (battery life down to couple hours after 6 months). Umidigi support replied back to me we on support phones you need to contact your vender for warranty. Do not buy if you expect any support or warranty.', ""I got this watch for my partner and myself and although only $40, I really had higher expectations that the bluetooth would stay connected to my phone while I was in another room. The point of having the watch was so I wouldn't have to look at my phone for messages during meetings/presentations, but not only am I still looking at my phone for messages, I am looking at my phone for the TIME. Because when this watch disconnects from the phone and I turn it off (especially at bedtime)...the time completely stops and I need to go into the phone app to reconnect it because the time is the same as when I turned it off... Fitbit can actually be used as a watch without a phone. This watch is a horrible accessory to the phone. I needs the phone or it doesn't have anything smart about it. Really disappointed.Going to be returning this watch and my partner's. They aren't happy with theirs either."", 'I ordered this watch as my second Umidigi watch and i like it very much. The box contains the watchm the charging cable and the user manual. As recommended in the manual, it needs to be fully changed before pairing with the phone. The pairing is using an app and is not difficult.I used this Urun smartwatch for 4 days and the battery level is at 81%, will likely last another 15 days before needed to be recharged. The design is very simplistic but functional, with a lot of features. It includes an oxygen sensor, and few reminders for drinking water, exercise, and others. The strap is a made of good quality rubber and makes it easy to put the watch on.Overall, the watch looks more like a premium watch and with similar features as the Fitbit but at a more competitive price.', 'Good hardware with a lot of potential. Large display is easy to read in full sun. Battery life is decent. Unfortunately the iOS app Paiactive is very flawed. There are obvious bugs like the step count always showing ____ on the summary page. The app randomly logs out and then you have to log in with your password , which  is not retained in the keychain. The timing and duration of sleep phases are totally different from a Fitbit charge 4, which accurately logs awake periods. I can be sitting for an hour reading with a pulse of 50 bpm but get a resting heart rate estimate of 70-80 bpm. Eyeballing it that would seem to be my average daily rate when I’m not doing an activity. I continue to use it because the clock face is legible in full sun as are messages and other notifications, things that the Fitbit is awful for.  So for $45 is useful but not as an activity tracker.', ""It has been a bit more than a month now I have been using this and held off on giving my feedback as I was expecting it to fail. It's still working! I am plesantly surprised.My thoughts on the fitness or other health tracking part is that you need to take it with a grain of salt as it counts my steps even if I move my arm while sitting at times. So I deduct 1/4 of steps from what it tells me. What I like about this watch is,  it has great display, gets me phone notifications, vibrates if you want or not,display activates when I want to see what time it is, looks stylish and certainly not cheap looking. Battery is okay, it lasts about 3.5 days or so and I just turned off the vibration to see if it would give me a better battery life. Screen is very bright and sometimes if I am wearing it for the night when you get up in the middle of the night you can see where you are walking in the dark with its bright display :) it does have a flash light function too by the way. I didn't use all of its functions that is available so I can't comment on them. You have to download an app on your phone to be able use this watch fully but once you set it up you can use it independantly, though it won't function fully. The app is buggy and has connection issues. Most of the time I don't bother updating it and the tracker info is available on the watch itself when needed. The app doesn't keep the history properly, so there is no use trying to get it to work. I hope they will come up with a better app soon.So in short, if you don't want to take a mortgage to buy an iphone or other big brand names, this is perfect."", ""When I opened the box, I was surprised and happy to see UMIDIGI has stepped up the well finished tasteful matching of watch bands and the tasteful matching of the aluminum watch frame.They make it easy to choose what sport you'll do. The nudge and buzz it gives to remind you to do some exercise is super. When I compared blood pressure, heart rate, to my blood pressure sleeve, Pretty much right on.I think the GPS makes it a great gift for kids and even the elderly with some form of memory impairment. The Pai active app is pretty good. Just remember to use the bar code to access it upon set up. My wife already told me she'd like one also."", ""This is a nice looking watch. I had for a long time different mibands (since the one with no screen up to mi Band 5) they served me really well. Because of that, I might just be spoiled by the battery lasting on this one.I'm using it for 5 days and the battery is already at 50% - and in not an intensive user and I don't have constant heart/pressure tracking activated. My last mi Band would last for 40-45 days.The app for this one is quite confusing. It doesn't have the same name on the branding or anywhere when you open it. It also trains a CRAZY amount of battery... So I have to stop the app if I don't want my phone to die half way the day.To connect the watch itself to the phone was a hard process...

I’ve had this watch for a couple of weeks and it takes so long to sync, if is does at all, that I’ve given up trying. The trouble shoot I’m told is that the watch is too far away from my phone, but actually I place the watch on top of the phone and still won’t sync (and yes my Bluetooth is on and so is the watch). The instructions manual provided is small and not very detailed. Also making this watch hard to use. I have made due by looking for answers online.

It does everything I need it to and I don't have to pay a fortune for a plethora of additional features that I don't need.  I used to use higher end smart watches which have a lot of customizability and ability to add additional apps but I am no longer interested in those features.  I find I played with those features in the beginning for a little bit, but in the long run only find value in the main functions.There are not a lot of watch faces to choose from on the Urun, but the ones that are there are fine for me.  There is no automatic activity detection, but I am fine with manually starting activity tracking when I'm going to go for a run or walk.  You do get a lot of detail on your phone about your activities which I like.I had a hard time figuring out how to get notifications on my watch like text messages and notifications of phone calls, but I eventually figured that out.  I don't get my e-mail messages, but that may just be a setting I am missing.  I didn't look for it too hard as I don't want my e-mails on my watch anyways.

One of the key features that attracted me to this new model smart watch is the long 10 day battery life and the fact that it's waterproof.  Both of these are super important and the reason that the Urun is better then others.There are a ton of features that I didn't even realize it offered (sleep monitor, GPS, route tracking, pedometer, best rate monitor, oxygen monitor, etc.).And the fact that I don't need to charge it daily or even weekly is amazing!

My journey with this watch didn't start well from the very beginning because it was delivered to a wrong address so I had to go at night by walk in the snow to get it myself. Good thing that it was only 200meters away but in front of other ppls door. Anyways... I had very high expectations as a 'first time smart watch user' but this did not get me. It was easy to set up and to connect it to the app but from the very first day I noticed it kept losing the connection with my phone, so some features (like the find my phone) was already totally useless because I always had to have my phone in my hand and reconnect the watch. I went to run with it 3 times, which was good, it was accurate with the distance and speed . After 4 days of use I wanted to reconnect it to my phone just with opening the app and it has never connected anymore... so the watch was not a watch anymore since it shows the accurate time only if it connects by bluetooth, you can't set up anything by yourself... I tried everything, resetting and restarting. I uninstalled the app and downloaded again... nothing helped. The watch lost its connection with my phone and I wasn't able to connect them again. I tried to get in touch with the company, their answer was: they don't deal with problems of their watches, they dont fix them, everything I need to know is written in the manual... I called Amazon, they didnt have any solution either so I'm returning the watch I really wanted to be the best for me. I give 2 stars because of the look (it is a pretty watch) and because of the good experience with the sport mode. But for me it became totally unusable.  I'm still thinking about giving it another go (and ordering another one) if other people had good experiences, maybe I was simply unlucky and got a model with errors.

I had few 30 mins yoga sessions these days, it only calculated 2 kcal per session.I am not complaining the APP as other comments perhaps it is now updated version.

However, the product feels incomplete due to the software. There are bugs here and there that can be easily fixed by a software update. The watch face design is very limited. The music player does not show song info. The watch does not allow users to choose what widget to display on the home screen. The remote camera shutter does not work with any other apps other than their own app.', ""This Umidigi watch was built with quality and class in mind.  I think it will become an instant classic smart watch .Like many fitness watches the Umidigi Urun smart watch has built in GPS which I will go into details later on.I've had the good fortune of trying out many Umidigi products like phones, earbuds and now watches.The areas I'm going to comment  are on the appearance, the functionality and most important how it feels on me.A watch with brushed chrome casing and a round face makes it looks like  normal Chronograph watch but it's much more as it can be used for casual or formal events with a switch of the face and/or band.Like other fitness watches it comes with step counter but you can choose from many sports for them.  Eg. running, badminton, dance, and walking just to name a few.  The GPS function tracks your sports activities in depth.  More than I can understand.Sleep tracking but this watch breaks down into light, moderate and deep sleep times.It also tracks blood pressure and heart rate and a bonus blood oxygen saturation check.I was able to change music tracks without pulling out my phone and the battery life pretty good even with the GSP on all the time.It was very comfortable to wear without having the edge digging into my wrist or forearm.  The waterproof feature was a pleasant surprise and it didn't stick to my skin when it was wet.This watch has great value and features for a smart watch, all for around $50."", ""The watch does exactly what it says.  I think it's fairly accurate, the blood pressure is off a bit compared to an actual machine.  It seems to track steps, haven't compared it to any other pedometer or anything like that.  It's not full screen, it's within a circle.  The APP is only ok.  My wife had some issues on her iPhone, I had one on my pixel5, but for the most part it works.  I don't expect anymore for the price."", 'Pesima opción para comprar o regalar. LA aplicación tiene funciones que el reloj no. Fue casi imposible colocarle la alarma y por si eso fuera poco a las 5hrs de uso llegó una actualización que hizo que el reloj dejara de funcionar.Era un regalo, me dio muchísima pena cuando me lo devolvieron para hacer la devolución...No cabe dura que lo barato sale caro', ""It was useless with my phone. The App it uses is called Paiactive. The rating for this App is 2.0 stars on Google Play. Many people have had the same problem with connectivity as I did. Its a good looking watch if you can connect it to your phone. It will not use Da Fit as other Umidigi's do. I am trying another model. Wish me luck."", ""Stylish watch,both suitable for men and women.The body is made out of stainless steel while the strap is available in silicone.It has a large 1.1 inch TFT curved touch screen with 2.5D glass and 240x240 resolution.  PRO's:Value for money,sporty design,suitable for swimming,built-in GPS,17 sports modes,SPO2 blood oxygen monitor,Bluetooth 5.0,Long battery life.  CONS:No wireless charging."", ""Great little watchThe app is a little strangely worded, but once you figure it outs, its a breeze to useThe battery lasts a very long time, haven't charged it since I got it, and its been five days, and its still going strong. The coating on the glass is great, it repels water and never gets any fingerprints. Has a ton of settings for different exercises and continually keeps track of your heart rate. Lift to wake is very reliable as opposed to other watches I have owned in the past. The strap is quite nice and the overall build is very sturdy. My favorite feature is that you can control you music playback with it, I use it for that quite often. The flashlight feature which just shows a bright white screen is surprisingly useful. It shows the weather too, though it doesn't seem to be very accurate, at least in my area.Overall its a very good watch, some features like the weather don't great, but everything else is fantastic!"", 'I ordered this watch in error - I wanted to track my SpO2 while sleeping, and this one doesn\'t do that.  Evidently the Urun ""S"" does that.  Note that the S does not have the GPS built in, but that\'s ok for me.This was my first smartwatch, so perhaps some of the cons below are normal?PRO:.  Sport mode tracks very nicely, draws a GPS map in the app.  Watch buzzes at every km (I believe that can be shut off).  I only tried the walking mode - steps were reasonably close to what my Samsung Health app in the phone reported.  Plenty of analysis on the walk, such as time per km, distance and steps travelled, speed, average heart rate, calories, steps per minute, pace for each km, etc..  Blood pressure was interesting, unfortunately I had no way to calibrate it, so I put my normal BP into the calibration routine, and it seemed to follow that logically after that..  SpO2 seemed reasonable, varying between 97 and 100%, it measures for several seconds after selected.  Again, nothing to compare with..  Continuous heart rate seems accurate, provides an interesting graph.  However, if you watch it in real time, it jumps unreasonably once in a while, so you just need to eliminate those..  Heart rate detection allows you to set a warning value..  Watch looks classy, and although there are a limited number of time displays, they look good..  Charging cable connects magneticallyCONS;.  Sleep quality was grossly inaccurate.  Some nights it had me in bed at 9pm, even though I was out driving the car at midnight once.  Typically said I was sleeping for 12 hours, when my CPAP would say 7.  It always rated my sleep very good..  SpO2 was manual only, not overnight, but that\'s my fault, confusing it with the model S.  Showing the time when you raise your arm only worked 50% of the time.  I tried moving my arm several different ways and had to wake it up with the button.  Other times it worked properly..  The alarm has to be set within the app.  You can\'t set it on the phone, and it does not adopt any alarms you set on your phone.  I did not test to see if it did buzz though when the phone alarm goes off..  The step tracker that is ongoing stopped tracking at noon one day, my phone said 3880 steps, the watch said 346..  Some things a bit hard to find in the app (Paiactive), but could get used to it.  For example, switching to continuous heart rate detection is done under the device tab in the app instead of the heart rate screen..  battery lasted only two days once, other times 4 days.  I suspect the two days was because I was leaving it in SpO2 mode overnight hoping it would monitor continuously (it didn\'t)..  the charging cable is proprietary, so if you lost it or broke it, not sure how you\'d get another.  Although some other watches look like they have a similar cable..  It shows weather, but only the forecast.  I don\'t know how it knows my local forecast - sometimes it was close to the forecast on my phone, sometimes not, e.g. for the day +2/-20c, where the Environment Canada forecast said +4/-9.  Current weather would be more helpful I would think, but not sure how many watches do that..  Support:  I contacted Umidigi support for clarification about the SpO2 monitoring, and they promised a 48 hour response - that was a week ago, and no reply.Bottom Line:  I\'m returning the watch.  I had considered ordering the Urun S as a replacement, but given the list of cons above, will try a different brand.  As an aside, I\'m considering:  Totobay (unclear re sleep SpO2 monitored), Mgaolo Fitness Tracker (fitbit style, but lower ratings for accuracy), and the Fullmosa FT.', 'Terrible GPS accuracy. I tried 2 hikes. 1 for 19k and the other is 22k. Both results show 80% to 100% mileage over. I put it on my desk and make in to run mode. For less than 3 hrs it show ran for 5k+. There is no way I can use it.', 'This watch itself is fantastic. It measures every single vitals I wanted from heart rate, blood oxygen and blood pressure. As well as all the functions I need for a smart watch. It even has a built in GPS which is insanely cheap for the price. The app will need to have a long way to go though. And it only has 4 watch faces even connected with the app. There is no way to download more. All in all good watch.', ""Don't like that I have to keep my phone close in order for information to be transferred or to have the info connected. I got this so I didn't have to walk with me phone all the time. Some of the features work perfectly fine as certain times, it hasn't been consistent. Especially the sleep tracking feature. Really wish that it wasn't like this... cute strap and nice rose gold feature."", ""I have checked the reviews before buying. Too bad I cannot leave zero.My reasons:1. My clock is never with the correct time. It was then stopped synchronizing. I don't know how to update the time.2. My iPhone never finds the watch. I have tried with iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 8.3. Since I can not synchronize and see the time, I feel I have bought a pedometer"", 'I have had an opportunity to use and test the product for a couple of days now.\xa0 While it has decent features for the price paid, I am finding that the overall execution needs work in several areas and I have returned the item:Appearance - overall I liked the look of the watch with round face and two function buttons.\xa0 However upon receiving the watch and seeing it in person I am quite disappointed in the size of the large bezel.GPS - During a cycling trip I compared the tracking against a Samsung Gear Fit Pro as well as a Samsung S10e.\xa0 Both of those devices measured the trip at 5.52km and 5.49 respectively and over time, although not perfect either, I have found them to be fairly accurate.\xa0 The Umidigi watch measured the same trip at 4.81km which is a significant variance.Paiactive Mobile App - I find the font size very small.\xa0 I realize that font size can be adjusted in my system settings, however none of the other apps has this problem at the current setting.\xa0 I shouldn\'t have to change my system settings for one app to make it readable.\xa0 In the same vein, I also find the grey font on white background, combined with an even smaller font size again, very difficult to read.Notifications - This is by far my biggest complaint about the device and in my opinion makes the watch almost unuseable.\xa0 As with the app, the font style and small font size make it impossible to check the notification with a quick/discreet glance, which is the whole point of having notifications on the watch.\xa0 The notification management is also a MAJOR problem.\xa0 The app allows you to turn notifications on or off for a number of popular messaging and social media apps as well at toggle for ""other"" which seems to lump all other apps and associated notifications into it.Unfortunatley, this also means system notifications such as charging status!\xa0 So while your phone is charging the app is continuously vibrating every mintute to tell you this.\xa0 The same thing happens when your various apps on your phone update in the background.\xa0 The watch vibrates when the download starts, vibrates again when it installs.\xa0 Needless to say this gets very annoying quickly.\xa0 The ONLY way to stop this is to either toggle ""other"" to off or put the watch on Silent Mode.\xa0 Either option is unacceptable becasuse it will cause you to miss all the other notifications that are useful and actually want.For the price, I didn\'t have high expectations.\xa0 I was actually pleasantly surprised and could have overlooked most of the other issues.\xa0 However, for me the notifications are a fatal flaw.', 'Muy satisfecho con mi compra, llego en excelente estado, es muy funcional a buen precio. Una desventaja tal vez seria el cable para cargar la pila, es una entrada muy especial y si se rompe no sabria donde conseguir otro cable, por lo demas me encanto, me dura de 5 a 7 dias la pila (con vibracion minima) y las funciones son muy utiles', 'EDIT TO MY EARLIER REVIEW:While the Umidigi Urun smartwatch is a great product, the App with which it is associated with (Paiactive App) has major issues. Most times, I am not able to connect the smart watch to the App. This reduces the functionality of the smart watch. For this reason, I have reduced my rating from a 5 star to 4 star.*********************************************************************************************************************************I have been very happy with Umidigi products in the past - I currently use the Umidigi F2 Cell phone and am very happy with its price and performance. Because of this I decided to try out the Umidigi Urun smart watch. I have to say that its great value for what it sells for. Its very nice looking and light in weight. It has tons of features and does take a while to get used to it. The pulse measurement is very accurate and matches with other pulse measuring devices. A word of caution for people wanting to use it to measure blood pressure. While it does take blood pressure reading, the results from wrist blood pressure measurement from any device are not as accurate as the ones that measure blood pressure on the arm. Some other interesting features are flashlight, sleep tracker, oxygen level and compass. All of these and many other features work great. My only request to Umidigi is to print the instruction manual in larger font or have a link to a website document that provides more detailed instructions on all the features. Keep up the great work in coming up with more reasonably priced products.', ""Got the Rose gold colour - looks great / very comfortable and has lots of features with a few drawbacks.Pros- Looks good / comfortable- Measures Heart Rate, Blood Oxygen Level, Blood Pressure- Sleep tracker- Fitness tracker- Lots of other functions- Battery life should be just under a weekCons- Manual isn't very clear (also quite small) - we're still trying to figure out how to work some functions:- Still trying to calibrate the compass & figure out how to use notifications- Weather doesn't seem to work beyond the current day- Android app wasn't available in the app store (had to download via QR link)"", 'So far I\'m impressed. Mainly with how well the ""lift to wake"" feature works. Vibration has different levels and the highest one is really strong. Probably go with the softer option to preserve battery.App works great but I did have to search for it in the Play Store. The APK (app installation file) from the QR did not install for me.I have an F1 from Umidigi and it\'s a steal of a deal and this is no different.', ""I do quite like all the features of this smart watch. The step count and heart rate seem fairly accurate. The GPS can take a moment to position itself, but then works well. The face is almost too sensitive, even my clothes activate it. The app is somewhat difficult to navigate and instructions for it, and for the features on the watch, are pretty much nonexistent. It's a steep learning curve, but once you figure it out, it works well. The battery though,  it's not great. It claims you get 10 days, and I'm lucky if I get 3 days out of it. Customer service says that 10 days is just approximate,  but that is a huge difference!  Few days here or there is fine, but not a whole week. Having to charge it every 3 days is inconvenient.  And I do tend to charge it every 2 days because it usually doesn't make it through the third day and definitely not a fourth day."", ""I bought this watch few months ago , I loved it ,although app was useless and I could never sync my info, still I was happy with watch, and battery life wasn't very good. still I was happy with the watch until yesterday my watch died completely , I had it over night for re-charge then in the morning was completely off and dead .

It is very fast to get the signal, and in terms of accuracy/precision, seems to be very high. For those that want to improve their running/walking performance and at the same time monitoring their health, it is very useful and the price is really affordable. All these features combined with the app really provide an unbiased data assessment for all of the info (with helpful plots and graphs) that it gets from the user.', ""La montre est vraiment impressionnante pour le prix car il y a beaucoup d'options et le design est vraiment réussi. J'ai été impressionné par le suivi du sommeil, mais je trouve dommage qu'il ne soit pas possible d'avoir une option manuelle au lieu du mode automatique de 08:00 pm à 08h00 am.

TicWatch Pro 3 GPS Smart Watch Men's Wear OS Watch Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100 Platform Health Fitness Monitor 3-45 Days Battery Life GPS NFC Heart Rate Sleep Tracking IP68 Waterproof ,https://www.amazon.com.au/TicWatch-Qualcomm-Snapdragon-Platform-Waterproof/dp/B08FR3TRNZ,"[""I am a bit fan of gadgets and have owned 3 smart watches to date. My first was one of Samsung's early models (curved screen) which I had for 3 years, and the last 2 were both Tic watches.I bought the Ticwatch Pro 2020 earlier this year and loved it. It was much smaller than I was expecting having read many people's comments, and although I have relatively small hands and wrists, I still was surprised at how small and comfy it is.When the Ticwatch Pro GPS was released, I liked the new swimming feature. Having a swimming pool, I wanted to be able to not have to work about taking it in the water. The Pro 2020 is water proof but it's not recommended that you swim with it.When I received the watch (a couple of days after ordering it) I was surprised to see the OS skin was different from the previous iteration. The animations were very smooth and a nice touch. The display also seems slightly crisper and brighter, but that could need my imagination.Done people have commented on the bezel around the screen, but I would have not noticed it had someone not mentioned it and it certainly doesn't impact the display.Even with all of the features enabled (24 hour heart rate be and SpO2), the battery life exceeds the 2020 by around a day. I tend to charge my devices every night so it doesn't impact me but it's nice to know I can continue to use it if I spend a night away without the charger. The new Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100 processor obviously has an impact on this longer battery life, being more efficient. Have I noticed it being more responsive than the 2020 model? Not really but this is probably due to the 2020 being fast in its own right.The charger has been miniaturised which means it would take up very little room in a bag but I do prefer the previous type as it was like a mini dock (same size as the watch), keeping your phone flat and level. You could just place it on the dock and the magnets would attach automatically. The new charger has to be placed in a specific place making it a little less convenient. First World problems!The watch is smaller and lighter than the 2020. One night when testing the sleep function, I couldn't tell if I had the watch on my wrist and had to feel to see if I had put it on. The new strap is all silicone (the 2020 had a hybrid leather/silicone combo). This makes it lighter and more comfortable. I guess they dropped the leather due to it being designed to be submerged which may have made it deteriorate over time but that's just a guess.Another new welcomed feature is the backlight for the LCD secondary screen. A flick of the wrist will either turn the back light on or, if you change a setting, the main display will turn on. I tend to keep the back lit LCD option as it is very easy to view in most lighting conditions, has essential information on all of the time and saves battery life. To wake up the main display, simply touch the screen or button.The Mobvoi software is very good and is my go to when exercising (over Google's own). It's not as good as the software for my Jabra Elite buds which overlays your running route on a map, but once again, it is easy to navigate and has enough basic information to make it useful. It also links with the miriad of sensors so all of your stats are in one place. I took it out on a bike ride and compared it to the Garmin. There was a slight variation between the 2 but that was down to the auto start/stop features suffering slightly on each device. Happy with both results.I have tested the other built in apps and have found them to be either useful (sleep monitor has been good due to having sleep apnoea) or a bit of fun (Tichearing monitors the ambient sound in decibels).Mobvoi has been one of the best companies that I have dealt with in a long time. They will answer emails within a day, 95% of the time. They don't always have the answer straight away but they keep in touch until any issues have been resolved. I even recurved a phone call (supposedly from California) to resolve an issue which was a nice touch.This watch has all of the features (and more) of some of the top end, mainstream branded ones at a fraction of the cost. It is perfect? No. There are some features which would have made it even better i.e. wireless charging, Military Standard 810G (like the 2020 model) etc but even without these, this watch is still very impressive.Would I recommend this watch? Absolutely. If you have ANY issues, Mobvoi will resolve the issue as customer satisfaction is high on their priority list."", ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0This new version of Ticwatch is more than I expected. It is super quick thx to new Qualcomm® Snapdragon Wear™ 4100 Platform and increased memory. There is no lag at all. It still have dual screen which I love, it is excellent feature which helps to safe battery. Comes with preloaded Ticwatch apps (Tic health, Tic exercise, Tic pulse, Tic Sleep, Tic Zen, Tic Hearing, Tic breathe and Tic oxygen), Watch strap has been redesigned compare to Ticwatch Pro. This new watch strap is very soft and comfortable. The band to hold the watch strap has a notch from underneath so it doesn't move and that is a great innovation as the band on Ticwatch Pro original leather bands were constantly moving. You can also change the watch strap to anything else you like. I have managed to get little over 3 days of battery life and that was with sleep tracking ON. It is very light and with the new watch strap I almost don't feel that I'm wearing the watch. I can highly recommend this watch and Ticwatch as their customer service is perfect ( My old Ticwatch Pro needed new charger and Ticwatch has send replacement free of charge within a couple of days )"", ""I have the Ticwatch Pro and that was a great smartwatch but I found that to be a little slow to react. It was troubled by a then out of date processor and only a small amount of RAM. Having upgraded to this newer version, it's like night and day! This is a fantastic watch! I've used it for about two weeks now and haven't noticed anything I regret about replacing my old one. Here's a few things I've noticed:Design: This is noticeably lighter so feels more natural on the wrist. It also has a slimmer form factor so any clothing slides over it easily. I also prefer this strap over the previous version as the consistent feel on the top and the bottom is better than leather on the top and rubber on the bottom (of the older one I had).Use: This has that great secondary screen feature that means the battery lasts ages! I've used this watch day to day, running and cycling and it's handy to be able to see the key bits of information like time, speed etc instead of having to reach for a button to get this info. The main screen in colour is also really vibrant and good to use in the sunSoftware: Wear OS runs much much smoother on this newer watch and has no noticeable lag. That was my main gripe with the first Ticwatch Pro. I like the 2 rows of apps when pushing the top button and the bottom button short cuts to Ticwatch's fit software. I used both Ticwatch and Google Fit and the GPS and mapping of exercise routes was picked up easily by both. Choose which one you prefer as the look and feel of each exercise app is different and it's good to have optionsTicwatch Apps: I'm not one to usually use many extra apps but I gave the Ticwatch ones a go. TicSleep - it's good to have a native sleep app now as there doesn't seem to be a decent one on the Wear OS app store. TicZen is a relaxation app which measures your state of relaxation. TicBreath tells you when to inhale and when to exhale to get you into a relaxed state. TicHearing measures the sound around you and warns you of unsuitable levels. There's TicOxygen which measures your blood oxygen levels and lastly there's a hand wash timer for how long you should be washing your handsOverall Summary: If you're after a cracking Wear OS watch then this is it. It's stylish, has a great battery and is packed with modern tech. What's more it runs Wear OS so you have access to Google's smartwatch apps. There's a lot of watch faces to choose from, either from Ticwatch or Google so you can customise the look even more."", ""I purchased the original Ticwatch Pro back in 2018 and so have done a comparison of the new Ticwatch Pro 3 and the original version to see how things have improved.Firstly, the physical differences:On taking the new one out of the box, the first thing I noticed was how much slimmer and less chunky looking it was than the original. Then, once I put in on my wrist, the difference was immediately clear. The Pro 3 feels very light on my wrist. (New 41.9g, old 58.5g) It almost feels like I don't have a watch on at all.  The new strap also feels nice against my skin. And the buttons have a nice tactile feel to them. You can see the physical differences in the photos. The differences are so obvious, I don't even need to say which one is which.One other great improvement is the charger. I had problems with the charger for my old Ticwatch Pro, which Mobvoi replaced for me free of charge. The connection of new charger has a much tighter feel.Secondly, the software:With double the RAM and storage of the original version, and the Snapdragon 4100 chipset, the performance is silky smooth. Setup and pairing with my phone was a breeze. Out of the box, one firmware update was waiting, along with some app updates. I have used the improved TicHealth suite of apps and found them all to work well. I really like the blood oxygen sensor. Quite a timely addition during the coronavirus pandemic.Overall, the Ticwatch Pro 3 is a real improvement over the original version; it's like night and day. And with it being the first watch to sport the Snapdragon 4100 chip, I say you can't go wrong with this."", ""As a one-sentence-summary, I am completely happy with the Ticwatch Pro 3.Prior to this, I've owned the original Ticwatch Pro (whose screen I unfortunately smashed), and the Ticwatch Pro 2020.  I still have the 2020, and it still works fine.  I'm just unlikely to ever wear it now, unless I'm doing something where I need a watch, and don't won't to risk my Pro 3.  The biggest question in my mind when buying this one was, will there be enough of a difference from the 2020 that this isn't me just wasting my money?  I've had it for a few weeks now, and I have zero buyer's remorse.  Everybody is different, but for what it's worth, here's my review...Physically, the Pro 3 is a smaller and lighter watch than the previous two versions.  It's not a huge difference on paper, but you see it and feel it.  The 3 looks more refined (less chunky) and it feels better on my wrist if I'm wearing it all day.  With the old format, you could kind of never forget you had it on, but this design is very comfortable.The screen on the 3 looks a bit sharper.  I'm not sure if it's just psychological, but it just seems a touch nicer than my 2020.  There is a black ring between the bezel and the display.  I don't really notice it unless I'm looking for it, but it's worth noting, because the display on the old design ran right up to the bezel.Performance-wise it's no contest.  Not even close.  The Pro 3 is way more responsive and smooth than the previous models.  The new processor is a definite upgrade that helps the interactions just work.  The default app layout is two column instead of one, so there's less scrolling, and the icons are more substantial.Battery life is fantastic.  The quoted 72 hours is no joke.  I run the display in smart mode with tilt-to-wake, and I'm running both the heart rate and Oxygen monitoring all the time.  So far there's been no trouble going 3 days, and even a little beyond, between charges.Bluetooth!!  My biggest gripe about both the Pro and Pro 2020 was their annoying tendency to break connection with my phone.  This was especially likely if the battery ran down fully before I charged it again.  The Pro 3 Bluetooth has been rock solid so far, without any special setup.  It just works.  I've even deliberately run the battery down to test it, and it still reconnects on its own as soon as it's recharged.  This is one of two changes that made me particularly happy.The second small/big thing that I really liked was the buttons.  I took a pic to compare, and it's kind of hard to see, but they made a slight change to the button position.  Effectively, the two buttons now sit at a wider angle from each other, and the space between them is just a tad larger.  Why is this such a big deal?  Because (for me anyway) it means when I bend my wrist, to rise out of a chair or lean on a table, the back of my hand doesn't mash the buttons anymore!  No more waking Google Assistant or powering off the watch by accident.  It's fantastic!  Seriously, kudos to whoever on the design team came up with that one.The last thing, and this is the closest to a negative that I've got, is the strap... Meh.  It's fine.  I did like the look of the previous leather/rubber hybrid a bit better.  But I have to admit, this one is comfy, and it will definitely be easier to keep clean, so I can't bash it too hard.Anyway, as I said at the beginning, I'm totally happy.  I think this is the last smartwatch I'll need for a while."", ""Its a good watch with bad build quality. The core design is good and the price is right but save your money cause I've tried 3 of these so far and they've all failed within the first year. And it isn't even just one thing. The first one had RAM issues, kept getting stuck when I tapped the screen. (2) had battery issues. Started dying in 4 hrs at 30% battery after 2 months. And now (3) has sensor failure. The sensor array on the back just stopped working one day. I'm a pretty careful user and the none of the watches had physical damage, they were just poorly built.Also, the seller blatantly disregards Australian Consumer Law. So much so, that when I made my case with links to the ACCC's website(thinking they were simply unfamiliar), they just ignored my mesaages and kept replying with the same default message. Thankfully Amazon had me covered."", ""I really wanted to like this watch, I did for 2 weeks. Everything was perfect. And then all the sensors died. A lot of people are in the same boat, but Google reviews just don't seem to bring up the issues people are having with this particular TicWatch, the other ones are fine as far as I know. I really wanted to endorse them because the watch was great, but it will be hard to sell me on TicWatch/Mobvoi in the future."", 'Had this for a bit over two weeks now and love it. I\'ve never been fond of synthetic bands but this feels OK and looks pretty good. The display is great - I\'ve only tried a few watch faces so far but those all work well and look good on the fairly high resolution display. Even though I use ""always on"" (main display, not the LCD) I\'m only charging every 3 days. So far, I\'m really happy with it.', ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0So far there's not much about this watch I don't like. It's comfortable, stylish and blends in very well with any style of clothes. The duel screen setup is excellent and saves a lot of battery life. The new snapdragon wear processor really makes google wear os usable and mobvoi have a very friendly user interface to go with it. Definitely recommend giving it a look!Warning: Toddlers will try to take this off your arm with brute force, the different screens are like lights to a moth"", ""Great watch for what little use I have had. 1 week and then the charge cable wouldn't charge. I checked the Mobvoi site and couldn't find one to replace. I ordered one from a third party vendor which should arrive this week. The reason I chose not to contact Mobvoi and instead pay for my own replacement charger, is that they would want me to send it back for warranty. I live in Australia so to wait for two lots of international shipping would take months. I'll update when I have used it longer."", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0I\'ve had a few smart watches and this is easily the best. I think it\'s a pretty good looking watch with the fake leather band (which of course is replacable if you don\'t like it). It feels good and works really well. There\'s no waiting as it\'s very snappy. I use the always-on display and have turned all sensors on (continuous 24-hour where applicable) and I generally still have about 70% battery left at the end of the day, depending on what I do. I love that you can scroll through your notifications one-handed by just flicking your wrist (see attached video). The default screen shown during my daily walk/run is simple but shows all the essential info in one screen; no need to swipe through different pages while walking.I use the ""OurGroceries"" app for shopping lists and I\'ve downloaded this to my Ticwatch. Now I can wander around the shops without having to hold my phone in one hand, crossing things off as I go on my watch, which updates the list on my wife\'s phone in real time. How cool?Definitely recommended and I would buy the same thing again without hesitation.', ""A good watch but full of annoying bugs which still have not been fixed, such as putting the phone into theatre mode (as there is no way to automatically turn off the watch face light at night) meaning you can't turn off your alarm in the morning, watch just keeps vibrating."", ""I have a small wrist, and even though this is a large watch, it doesn't appear over large, on. I'm really happy with it so far. I haven't pushed the battery to allow it to deplete completely, and it charges up reasonably quickly. The smoothness of screen changes is great, although scrolling through the app screen could be better. The one thing I would say needs the most work is the instructions. They're pretty basic. But there are a lot of online forums and such that will give you tips etc, but it would be nice if you didn't have to. Must have apps are Facer and Watchmaker for watch faces. The mobvoi app also needs work. Overall I'm happy with my purchase."", ""My first wear OS watch, it actually surprised me.

All of the apps link to Google accounts, I set up with iPhone in about 25 minutes.  The face is pretty responsive to touch.  I haven’t had it long enough to opine on longevity, but I hope the sizing information was helpful to your purchase decision.', 'It\'s hard to tell in the pictures just how thick the watch is - it\'s not for small wristed people, or if you don\'t like a big watch. It\'s not overly large, just very ""present"".  I do like a larger watch display, just not a large, clunky metal band. My Diesel watch is gunmetal with a gunmetal band. The metal band was just too much for me, so I purchased a color coordinating Barton band on Amazon for $20 - matches perfectly and is so much more comfortable. The watch is rated ATM5 so pairing it with a silicone band means I can swim, take a shower, wash dishes, etc without worry.You\'ll need to download the Google Wear OS app to sync it with your phone. I already had it installed and am familiar with it as I own several other smartwatches on the Wear OS platform. The Diesel On is definitely the fastest and most responsive watch that I have used. Most apps load or display data as soon as you select them and the Google Assistant prompts and replies relatively quickly (after the first use - the first time is always sluggish). I was not fond of any of the pre-installed Diesel watch faces so I installed Facer and selected one of those - thousands of free ones to choose from.The battery last all day with some left over. I\'m not a heavy watch user, mostly to quickly review text messages while driving, checking the time and I have used Google Pay several times. It\'s pretty cool at the grocery store checkout - just waiving your watch paying wirelessly! The NFC range is generous, I had no problems with it being accepted at several merchants.Overall this is a nice looking, rugged and sophisticated watch that will most likely last for several years. I look forward to wearing it - probably more often now as it\'s much more responsive and has many more features than previous models.', ""The Diesel On DZT2017 men's Axial touchscreen stainless steel smartwatch, with movement and band made in China, includes a rapid charging cable and uses Google’s Wear OS.

I tried using the phone feature on the Axial smartwatch and discovered I prefer to use my phone for calls.  I set the Axial Smartwatch to answer calls only.  I like the addition of tones to alert to calls and notifications though.The only feature I miss is automatic sleep tracking.  This should be a Google OS feature but isn’t.  I have Runtastic installed on my old watch, but they discontinued the watch app so I cannot install it on the Axial smartwatch. There are alternatives, however all the ones I found require setting sleep tracking on an off manually.  Yeah… not gonna happen with me.

They also have a heart rate monitor, GPS, an NFC chip for Google Pay, and Google Assistant for weather updates, calendar appointments, reminders, and more.Additionally, each watch comes with a few pre-installed apps, including Google Fit, Spotify, Noonlight, and Cardiogram.  You can use other apps on it, I had a few that I tried loading that I use on my Note 8 and some worked, some didn\'t.This Diesel On Axial smartwatch feels like the most durable of the ones that I have looked at. The 44mm stainless steel case is 12mm thick and features rivets along the bezel that gives it a rugged look. On top is a 1.28-inch display with 328 pixels per inch and a variety of animated watch face options.  The wrist strap is 24mm wide.  I loaded a screen app that gave me a simple Digital Time/Date as I found the ones that came with it both overly frenetic and used too much power.The smartwatch is available in a few different colors, including gunmetal, silver, and a bronze-tone stainless steel that you can match with either a black leather, blue denim, or gunmetal stainless steel strap.  I have the gunmetal with the stainless steel strap.  I found it difficult to get the strap sized to my wrist, which is about 6.5"" in circumference.  People with larger wrists will find it easy to size, I ended up ordering a Barton silicone strap to use with it.  The Barton strap lowers the weight of the watch by 2 oz. which is a lot, very comfortable and you can get colors to match your watch.  I got the black with red inside and it looks really impressive.The watch\'s speaker supports phone calls; Fossil\'s proprietary app allows both Android and iPhone users to take calls right from their wrists.  Since I wear hearing aids, this is not a feature that will work in some environments for me.  I have tried linking it up to my Bluetooth hearing aid device, but it keeps defaulting to my phone.  It does let you answer the phone from your watch so you don\'t have to pull out your phone to see who is calling.  Since my phone number is public due to my business, I get a lot of spam calls . . . hint, get Truecaller to block those, works great.Thanks to the Qualcomm 3100 Wear chipset, the Diesel smartwatch has four battery modes: Extended Battery Mode (lasts multiple days on a single charge with access to only essential features); Daily Mode (enables most features); Custom Mode (allows you to manage battery settings yourself); and Time-Only Mode (only tells time). I have tried to gauge the time each works, Daily Mode barely makes it through my day so Extended Mode seems to be my best choice as it seems to make it at least two days.  One of the great features is the charger that can bump it back up quickly if your watch is running slow.  The only question I wanted an answer too is where I get a second charger cable which is proprietary -- finally learned to order one from Fossil who actually makes the watch.  I will have one for travel and one that stays by my bed.  Note this watch is so big and heavy with the original metal link band there is no way I would wear it to sleep, now with the Barton band it is fine . . . you can add a sleep tracking app if you want.Charging is really fast.  I put it on the charger every morning as I eat breakfast and it is completely charged by the time I finish my coffee.This is a big, heavy, durable watch.  Note that you can dive with it as it is supposedly good to 160\'.', ""I was first attracted to this smartwatch based on its awesome looking display. It looks like the inside of a computer or something, but it looks pretty cool. It has a lot of great features that are typical of smartwatches. The screen display is very easy to read when either just checking the time or using the various apps. Some of the many features it has include: heart rate & distance tracking, Google Pay, receive notifications and alerts, check calendar, change music, etc. The watch both looks and feels durable in the Gunmetal color that I got. The one area that I thought this watch is lacking is the battery life. It claims to have a 24 hour battery life that can be extended up to two more days in low power mode. I seem to get about 12 hours of daily usage out of the watch, which is a far cry from the alleged 24 hour battery life. So it gets me through the day for the most part, but I have had it die on me several times before the day is even over. I feel this could be an excellent watch if they were able to improve the battery life, although it does charge rather quickly. Overall this is a pretty cool looking smartwatch that's loaded with features, but at this price you might want to consider the shorter battery life based on your estimated usage before deciding to purchase."", 'This smartwatch from Diesel is one of the nicest looking watches I own and gets frequent compliments. The only downside I’ve found is as other iPhone users have mentioned – the interaction with Google’s Wear OS app can be frustrating.The stainless steel gun metal gray case Smartwatch looks very cool. The underside of the case that sits against your wrist is plastic. I’ve had issues with other smartwatches in the past where this pops off. It’s something to keep an eye on – especially if you’re planning to use this watch during physical activity. Once the back pops off, that’s all she wrote. There is also a textured red band that runs around the side of the case My watch came with a gun metal gray linked band. Unless you have the tools to pop out the links, you’ll need the assistance of someone at a local jewelry store. Also included in the packaging is a separate matching buckle to use in the event you want to swap out the band with one made of leather, plastic, etc. And lastly, you get the standard watch charging cable.The touch screen is flat, not convex like many other watches. If you have a watch that uses Google’s Wear OS, you’ll see the same familiar options and have the ability to swap and download watch faces. There are also some user-friendly watch face creation apps out there that will work with this as well. Taping the crown (the dial) twice will open up options for you – where you’ll see the main menu, giving you options such as settings, dial effects, Find my iPhone, your agenda, and Google Fit, among several other items. This is also where you can update connectivity. This is where the Wear OS software is lacking. If you’re connecting to an Android device, you’re good; connecting to an iPhone is frustrating, as the connection is dropped more often than not. The watch, however, will still run, and interface with you. You just won’t be able to sync if for additional connectivity, unless you’re in a Wi-Fi zone.The watch comes in a square leather box that really makes for a nice presentation. In addition to the watch and the other pieces I mention above, you also get a set-up manual, as well as a user manual in several different languages. The box is definitely worth holding on to. It can be used to not only house your watch when not using it, but as a nice place for keepsake items.Battery life is good and will get you through the day, maybe two. So you’ll need to keep the charging cord with you on trips. One interesting feature was the battery saver option that allow you to adjust the power draw on our watch, limiting features you might not use.Overall – a very nice watch that you can wear on any occasion (dressy or casual) that will leave a nice impression. The only drawback is the Bluetooth connectivity with the iPhone. Once the Wear OS app is fixed to address this, this will be a stellar watch.', ""Diesel On Men's Axial is a work of art. It has a larger than average size and weight about it with a Steam Punk gun metal design. Wearable OSs has improved markedly since my last smart watch and this is very much on evidence in how smooth, quickly and effectively this Axial works. It has a beautiful assortment of faces to choose from with the default classic Steam Punk styled one being my personal favorite. It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionality which latches easily onto my phone, head-phones and my home theatre. I was able to easily control most my network devices with this watch. It also has a speaker phone in it enabling the user to talk directly into it; I felt like Dick Tracy when using this feature! It comes with a charger and charges rather quickly, but discharges more rapidly than I would like. I would nonetheless mention that the charge is better than my prior smart-watch and once you learn how to use it efficiently, the battery time can last longer. The watch claims 8 gigs of memory and 1 gig of ram. This gives it clean and smooth the graphics far superior to earlier such devices and a touchscreen that’s very accurate quite responsive. Its keyboard is likewise larger and more accurate than I found in earlier generations of smart-watches. If you have $350 to spend on a smart watch, then this should be at the top of your list of options."", ""My husband hadn't worn a watch in ages!  He used to want one of those fancy GPS watches, when he was in the military, but ever since he got out he hasn't really worn any.  He's always talking about how he wanted a Dick Tracy style watch, but that he was holding off until they got all the kinks worked out.  While we haven't been able to get him talking over the watch, it's nice for everything else it can do.  If you use wi-fi for calling, this watch will not allow you to talk over it.  It seems to make the voice go in and out, if you try wi-fi calling.  We haven't had the opportunity to test this with cellular service, but that's just due to our location.  Other than that, every other function of this watch works great.  My husband mostly likes the additional features like being able to see the weather quickly, his HR, and to see notifications.  I would say notifications are his favorite aspect.  He can quickly see Discord messages pop up, and easily dismiss them.  Watch function works nicely.  You can change the design of the face, by going into the app.  Had to take this to a professional in order to get it fit properly.  Considering the price of this thing, it's worth the $10 charge.  You don't want to be hammering on this in your garage.  On that note, be sure to get a screen protector for this thing.  It's super in-expensive, and worth it.  You don't want to wear this for a few days, and end up with a scratch on the face.  I got one that just had me squirt some water on it, and drop this glass protector on.  I can't even tell it's on, unless I scrutinize it.  Considering this was an impulse grab for him, I'm excited at how much he loves this thing.  I'm just worried that he's going to want more watches.  Watches with touch screens.  Expensive watches with touch screens.  Help me now!!BTW.  This thing is built like a tank.  It's solid, and there is nothing that makes me think something might snap off or otherwise break easily."", ""If you like large watch faces and Google's Watch OS, this is a good choice for a watch. The face itself is huge which is good for us guys with diminishing eyesight. I have to hold a watch farther away from my face than I did five years ago, but this watch isn't that bad.Since this is a Diesel watch no one is going to look at it and mistake it for another brand because Diesel is unique. They make big beefy watches that are built like tanks.The watch features a snapdragon 3100 cpu and a gig of ram which means it can run all the animations without chugging too much.

The teenager who is wearing it is still learning to use it and the things he can do with it.  He is related to me and naturally did not read the directions.  He says it's like learning on the run.  He did not have any difficulty connecting to his iPhone XR.  He found all the basic things right away -- the things he was looking for in a smart watch -- activity tracking and heart rate.  He has been able to customize it to do the things he needs it to do.The only difficulty he has is wearing an actual watch.  He never has.  He says he is getting used to it by thinking of it as a little computer on his wrist.  Time is only a small part of it.""]"

"OPPO Smartwatch 46mm, 1.91” Display, Wear OS by GoogleTM, Dual-Chip Endurance System, VOOC Flash Charging, 50-Meter Water Resistance, Heart Rate Monitoring, Black ",https://www.amazon.com.au/OPPO-Smartwatch-Dual-Chip-Resistance-Monitoring/dp/B08HK4QNXM,"[""My third Wear OS smart watch and the best one so far. It looks fantastic, the screen size (46mm) is wonderful and sits on my wrist just fine. Not bulky at all. The display is sharp and crisp and quite readable in outdoor conditions. The responsiveness of Wear OS is smooth and quick. No lag or pauses between commands and execution. The OS is skinned by OPPO and is better for it. Just little tweaks here and there that improve it (eg. an app tray for icons rather than a stack of icons to scroll up and down through). The fitness stuff works well and the sleep measuring seems accurate, and I can attest that the watch is comfortable enough to wear through the night. On the subject of comfort, the defacto silicone strap is fine but I did replace it with a nylon one as I prefer this material on my wrist. The watch also does a good job of handling calls. The speaker handles voices well but obviously will be impacted by the sound levels of the environment you make / receive calls in. The only downside at the moment woukd be the limted amount of watch faces available for the device. The ones supplied are adequate and utilise the whole screen, whereas ones in apps like Facer don't because they're either square or round which don't suit the rectangular nature of the OPPO watch's screen. However, there is an update coming to the watch that apparently has an extra fifty faces to choose from, but as of yet my watch hasn't received it so I can't comment on that.All-in-all this is an awesome smart watch and is a fantastic advert for Wear OS and wearable tech."", ""I had a Fossil GEN 5 and my only gripe was hat the crown should have been in a different position. I constantly found myself pressing the the button by mistake all the time. Got to the point where I had to install an app to stop Google voice from working which took away a lot of Google options. Think was mainly due to the fact that my wrists are too big. I gave it to a friend and it's fine for him. Is still a great watch but I love oppo and oneplus products."", ""Pros:Accelerometers good (Heartbeat sensor, steps)Fit apps are ok, but hard to integrate into Android ecosystemLots of watch facesSpeaker/microphoneCons:Convoluted interface - really makes you appreciate the Apple watchDisplay adaptability (light)Lack of CustomisabilityNotifications not greatSleep tracking doesn't work with Google fitI switched to this because I switched from iPhone to Find X2 Pro.

And the user interface was very laggy too.But, after completed two recharging cycles [approx. 2x(20% to 100 %)] I got more than 24 hr battery life without any power saving mode (with Tilt to wake ON, automatic brightness ON, notification like call, message etc. from phone ON, Continuous Heart Rate sensor ON). And the user interface is also very very smooth now.Tips for battery life:-1. Turn OFF Location services when you are not using maps or any workout modes.2. Only use wifi while charging your watch. ( Actually No need to use wifi, because internet can be accessible on watch through the phone\'s bluetooth, if phone\'s internet connection is ON. No need to enable any options like hotspot sharing, tethering etc.)3. Turn OFF these settings on WearOs app on phone ""Advanced Settings->Watch app data usage"" turn of both sync options. ( If you want do it while charging only)4. Disable any unused gestures.5. Disable all notification sync from Unused apps. Only enable sync notification from messaging apps on phone. And mute all messy telegram group messages on phone.Pros:-1. Huge number of watche faces are available.2. Lot of wearos apps support on playstore3. Ability to  install apks (If you know how to use adb and fastboot on windows or mac)4. All the sensors are accurate. I checked the step counter also. It will never count any false steps while driving, motor bike riding etc.5. Stability of connection with phone.6. Very very very Fast Charging.7. Ability to connect Bluetooth headset.8. Google assistantCons:-1. Watch has NFC. But currently there is no Google pay support in India (09-oct-2020).2. WearOs Optimisations are good in this watch. But Need improvements.3. Battery life is good as compared to apple watch. But it\'ll be very good, if it has more battery life.', ""So I usually do reviews for games so this is new to me overall but I'm going to pinpoint my views entirely over this watch.Good points.This watch has so many amazing features from being able to seemlessly able to track my daily exercise routines to even my sleeping which has helped me try and improve a more balanced sleep schedule with possible workout routines and even telling me when I should get up and move about which I usually take for granted but this has pushed me to try and move more than be stable consistently, I would also like to add the capability of awnsering calls and messages is very accurate being scottish I typically have a hard time voice commands understanding what I say and it seems to honestly understand me fully when sending sms or WhatsApp messages through the vocal command so it's fantastic in those areas, I would also like to add the awensering calls through my watch and using my WiFi earphones works perfectly together alongside the added feature of using Spotify on my watch also.If I was to change anything and that's if I've maybe not stumbled across it yet would be to allow for more customisation to adding tiles to the right swipe section or even the left side to allow for apps such as Spotify Google pay etc to be more easy acessable with the swipe of a finger, also the Google pay feature is a god send it completely takes away the fact I need to hold a wallet now unless I'm purposely wanting cash in my pocket!I would also say the battery life of this watch is pretty awesome its charging process time and it's ability to not die for literal over 48 hrs is awesome and the crispness of the led screen is insane for someone who wears contacts or glasses I used to stray away from smart watches for being so small in texts but the oppo watch 46mm has the perfect size and ratio for someone who isn't 20/20 vision.Overall all this watch is perfect for a techy or sports like or ease of access type of people and I'd give this watch a 10/10 and I'm really looking forward to see where this brand goes in the future so thanks for the purchase and also allowing me to get the watch for the 249 rather than the 279 I was pleasantly suprised!"", 'chunky for.no reason. inspite of that, battery life is absolutely nonsense. even when dont use GPS, i need to charge everynight.there are better devices with superb functions available for less.

Perfetto.Veloce, intuitivo e nitido.Uno schermo grande, luminoso e dai colori brillanti e definiti.Audio buono sia per suonerie, chiamate ( si può rispondere o far partire una chiamata o un sms) o musica.Connessione perfetta, sia bluetooth che wifi.Essendo parrucchiera è a costante contatto con l\'acqua e si sta comportando benissimo.Non perde un colpo.Per quanto riguarda Whatsapp: si può rispondere ai messaggi scrivendo oppure dettando vocalmente ma non si possono inviare direttamente messaggi vocali purtroppo (whatsapp su questo è ancora limitato).Anche il lato sportivo/salute è molto preciso e ricco di funzioni.La batteria sembra scarsa i primi giorni ma si ""assesta"".Come vedete nella foto, ho la batteria al 85% e sono le 16:02.

Die Uhr ist definitiv roségold.Grundsätzlich ist die Uhr hochwertig verarbeitet und gibt ein Gutes Gefühl. Leider gibt es aber auch ein paar Mankos. Zum einen, und das ist das Wichtigste, war die Schrittzählung überhaupt nicht richtig. Es waren immer nur 50% von dem was mir andere Fitnesstracker angezeigt haben. Desweiteren gibt es nur ca. 5 Sportmodi (Laufen, Fahrradfahren, sowas). Man hat die Möglichkeit über die Google Fit App auf der Uhr das Training zu tracken (wo es wesentlich mehr Auswahl gibt), dieses synchronisiert sich dann aber nicht mit der Oppo eigenen App fürs Smartphone.Ferner kann man für die Schlafenszeit keine Berührungssperre einrichten (wie bspw. Beim Mi Fit Band).Was ich richtig toll fand ist Google Maps auf der Uhr. Wenn man mal mit dem Fahrrad oder Roller unterwegs ist, kann man kurz auf die Uhr schauen um die Route zu verfolgen. Allerdings aktiviert sich das bei jeder Route automatisch auf der Uhr. Im Auto unnötiger Akkuverbrauch. Vielleicht kann man das abstellen, habe nur nicht herausgefunden, wie.Am Ende ging die Uhr zurück. Auch der Preis ist verglichen mit High Performer Smartwatches (zB Galaxy Watch 4) ziemlich hoch dafür dass soviele Funktionen fehlen.', ""L'orologio è gradevole e cerca di imitare Apple watch in tutto.L'unica cosa su cui non potrà mai riuscirci , e questo non è colpa di Oppo, è il sistema operativo.Android Wear è limitato, poco sviluppato e poco supportato.La quantità di app è imbarazzante : da questo punto di vista chi sposa Android è fortemente in svantaggio perché credo che al momento , forse un pò i Garmin, nessuno raggiunge la qualità di Apple Watch che si , è eccessivamente costoso (a quel prezzo io comprerei un orologio tradizionale che sicuramente nel tempo può solo aumentare di valore) ma è piú avanti. L'assistente vocale poi non regge il confronto con Siri : ancora non hanno risolto dei bug basilari come il poter richiamare un nome dalla rubrica che è la cosa piú basilare che uno smartwatch deve avere"", 'Von der Hardware her ist die Oppo Watch richtig gut, aber was nutzt es, wenn Oppo es nicht hinbekommt eine vernünftige Software zu entwickeln!! Egal welches Smartphone mit Android ich benutzt habe, es erfolgte keine Kopplung über die Oppo App ""Heytap"". Und ohne diese ist die Watch fast unbrauchbar. Wear OS zeigt dadurch kaum relevante Daten an und auch der Sprachassistent von Google ist damit wertlos. Für den Preis hole ich mir doch lieber eine Apple Watch 3. Oppo sollte dringend seine Smartphone App überarbeiten und die Akkulaufzeiten (miserabel) verbessern. Fazit von mir: ""Die Watch geht zurück nach Amazon"".', 'Oppo Watch 46mmEs ist erstaunlich, wie einfach man heute Dinge als das Nonplusultra verkaufen kann. Das hat aber vermutlich mit der Gier zu tun, immer etwas Neues haben zu müssen.Da meine Smartwatch-Sammlung langsam in die Jahre gekommen ist dachte ich, es sei einmal an der Zeit für einen Neuzugang. Die vielfältigen Lobeshymnen auf die Oppo Watch machten die Entscheidung recht einfach: Sie sei die Apple Watch für Android etc.Zugegebenerweise machte sie beim Eintreffen eine gute Figur. Besonders die hochwertige Verarbeitung und die Auswahl der Materialien hierfür beeindruckten. Besonderes Highlight ist das gewölbte Display. Eine weitere Auffälligkeit war das anders als üblich montierte Armband. Während sich bei allen zweiteiligen Armbänden das Teil mit der Schließe oben befindet, ist es hier an der Unterseite montiert. Diesen Umstand habe ich sofort geändert, was mit der einfachen Montageeinrichtung ein leichtes Spiel war. Trotzdem ist das Armband der erste herbe Kritikpunkt an der Uhr. Das Anlegen ist strapaziös, welches der offenbar viel zu weit gestalteten Schlaufe, in der man das Band nach dem Anlegen fixiert, geschuldet ist. Diese Schlaufe rutscht stets nach unten und verhindert somit das Einführen des gewünschten Loches im Armband in den dafür vorgesehenen Dorn. Man kann die Uhr praktisch nur Anlegen, wenn man eine sitzende Position einnimmt, die eigentliche Uhr auf dem Knie ablegt, um somit die Dornschließe einigermaßen sicher schließen zu können. Das ist nicht erfreulich, schon gar nicht in diesem Preisniveau!Die an verschiedener Stelle gerügte Anzahl an Watch Faces ist ebenfalls berechtigt. Es gibt höchstens zwei oder drei, die wirklich ansprechend sind, alles andere ist Kinderei. Hinzu kommt, dass viele auch noch mit technischen Fehlern behaftet sind. Bei einer aktualisiert sich die Außentemperatur nicht von selbst sondern erst, wenn man das Wetter-Tile manuell aufgerufen hat (!!!), ein anderes aktualisiert nicht einmal die Uhrzeit im Allways On Display, sondern bleibt ständig auf dem zuletzt aufgerufenen Wert stehen. Fürwahr: Die ideale Arbeitgeber Uhr! Über diese Dinge könnte man ja noch lachen und würde sie einer €19,99 Uhr auch sicherlich zubilligen!Geradezu bedenklich stimmt mich, dass die Uhr plötzlich und ohne ersichtlichen Grund 10 Minuten vor ging! Auch ein Neustart hat hier nichts bewirkt, aber ebenso urplötzlich ging sie dann auch wieder richtig. Einen solchen Schnitzer kann sie sich natürlich nicht öfters leisten bzw. sie ist jetzt schon in Anbetracht dieser Umstände auf der Arbeit absolut unbrauchbar!Fazit: Die Oppo watch ist ein wunderbares Beispiel für den Generationen-Konflikt, der leider immer öfter zu beobachten ist. Die jungen Generationen streben nach immer mehr  Leistung und lassen dabei das wichtige und wesentliche sträflich vernachlässigt zurück. So dürfte meine Oppo watch ihren Platz in der Vitrine gefunden haben, ohne jemals richtig zum Einsatz gekommen zu sein. Schade eigentlich.', ""One word, GO FOR IT.My main specific Purpose to buy this watch is,1. Check and receive calls on watch  [✔]2. Always-on display to check the time  [✔]3. Google Maps  [✔]4. Best Display  [✔]5. Smooth UI  [✔]all above reasons are fulfilled, so no special complaint.It's the best watch I have got, to date. I wish I would have bought it earlier.Just by reading, review, I was thinking about battery life is low and all. I would rather say, it is an Android Wear OS watch, you can expect 1-day battery life and I am ok with it.My setting with watch includes,1. Always-ON-display --> ON {Big Fan, here}2. Notification for only Gmail, Messaging, Call --> ON3. Recieve Call on watch --> ON4. WiFi, GPS, NFC --> OFF, actually I feel keeping WiFi on doesn't make sense.The best thing about this watch is OPTIMIZATION. It has limited official watch faces, but each watch face has its own version of the Always-ON-display face. On-call, the message also takes advantage of the always-on display.Health Tracking, I didn't explore this side. No comments here.Last word,We have to always make the trade-off with battery life. It totally depends on you and your usage. As it serves my purpose I am happy. Also, you won't find any other watch at this price. I bought it for 16k including offers"", 'One of the best wearos watch ever seen. 41mm is waste compared with 46mm in terms of usage and performance (based on reviews in youtube and amazon).

Ok lo sto usando da due giorni, il primo giorno ricaricato 2 volte e mezzo (era al 50% quando è arrivato), ricevendo anche un messaggio di errore sulla ricarica rapida per temperatura alta. Il secondo giorno, staccato alle 8 di mattina è arrivato alle 7 di sera con uso non intenso. Ma aspetto appunto altri due giorni per capire se la batteria si assesta.2: In questi giorni di caldo purtroppo ho dovuto togliere l\'orologio perché si è scaldato troppo e mi ha dato molto fastidio al polso.3- volume troppo basso, le chiamate si sentono solo se c\'è silenzio, al minimo rumore diventa inudibile.Questi sono i tre motivi principali... Aggiungo che personalmente non lo trovo così bello come raccontano dal punto di vista del design, il software è abbastanza scarno e nonostante sia wear Os non posso avviare una chiamata con l\'assistente vocale mi risponde ""mi dispiace non posso più farlo"" oltre al fatto che il comando OK GOOGLE funziona 1 volta su 5, e diversi comandi non funzionano come si smartphone...male, malissimo in questo senso, perde tutto il vantaggio nei confronti di Tizen. Le app nello store sono poche e la maggior parte sono a pagamento e sono anche care.La luminosità automatica è troppo conservativa, all\'esterno si è costretti a regolare manualmente la luminosità massima.Unica nota positiva è che il touch risponde bene e l\'orologio è sempre reattivo.Rimandato per altri 4 giorni, poi aggiorno la recensione e deciderò se renderlo.

Tornando al H/W del watch ho riscontrato, forse solo sul mio, che l\'aggancio del cinturino è un pò ballerino e spero che non si stacchi facendo sport rischiando di perderlo o romperlo; ho ordinato un nuovo cinturino per capire dov\'è il problema. Il costo non è tra i più competitivi però di secondo polso o in offerta puoi comperarlo con qualche riduzione di prezzo, io sono riuscito ad aggiudicarmelo a 180 euro che trovo sia il suo vero prezzo.

Esto está bien cuando das vueltas a un circuito. Pero no pone los datos del km, ni del último km u otro intervalo, lo único que pone es el tiempo del último km cada vez que completas uno. Para correr al aire libre es mejor lo segundo.- En el modo de entrenamiento por intervalos no pone el ritmo que llevas en ese intervalo ni casi ningún dato, solo pone lo que te falta para el siguiente. Tampoco indica cuántas series llevas ni cuántas te faltan para acabar, si son más de 10 tienes que ir llevando la cuenta y se supone para eso llevas el un reloj ""inteligente"".- En el modo de entrenamiento por intervalos puedes elegir las series por distancia, por tiempo o manuales, pero ya que el reloj tiene pulsómetro, estaría bien que tuviese la opción de intervalo por frecuencia cardíaca, por ejemplo: correr hasta llegar a 180 ppm y que te avise, después bajar a 120 ppm y te avise de nuevo.Aspectos del reloj en sí:- El GPS no va mal, a veces tarda en coger la señal, pero en zonas sin edificios altos dibuja bastante bien el trazado.- Buena duración de la batería, pero lo de los 70 días será si no lo usas. Corriendo 1 hora de media al día con GPS y con el modo de medición continua de ritmo cardíaco dura 4-5 días.- Buena medida de la frecuencia cardíaca.- El altímetro barométrico mide lo que le da la gana. Tampoco se puede pedir precisión ahí teniendo en cuenta el precio.- Lo de la resistencia al agua será verdad, no lo he usado para nadar, pero corriendo con mucha lluvia se vuelve loco y se pausa, para la actividad, etc. El táctil se tendría que poder desactivar o directamente no ser táctil la pantalla.Otras funciones del reloj:- No tiene aplicación de escritorio, web o algo así, solo la app Zepp, y es bastante limitada.- Puedes usarlo para controlar la música del móvil pero no estando en el modo de entrenamiento.

"Garmin Vivosmart 4, Fitness Activity Tracker, Gray with Rose Gold Hardware ",https://www.amazon.com.au/Garmin-Vivosmart-Fitness-Activity-Hardware/dp/B07GMCBQD1,"[""I was very impressed with the quick delivery.I wish I could say that I was impressed with the Vivosmart. It does some things superbly but others not so well at all, compared with my old Fitbit Alta.The Vivosmart does a great job of measuring my sleep, heartbeat, pulse rate and stress levels. But it doesn't do anywhere near as well at tracking my exercise. The step count is significantly lower than the Alta and it just doesn't measure when I've been for a walk. It tracks the steps but not the activity. I have no idea why. On one occasion, when I put on a spurt, it tracked about 2 minutes of running. Trust me, I don't run!!I also find the screen difficult to manage. I would have preferred a landscape orientation, as portrait displays the time in two parts, the hours on one line and the minutes on another. At night, though, when it's tracking my VO2 the display changes and it's all on one line and virtually unreadable to my ageing eyes. The menus too are quite hard to manage, as the menu button is so close to the area I'm trying to scroll, and I quite often end up going up a level by mistake.I have to say, though, that it is a very attractive piece."", ""I wanted to get an activity tracking watch and bought the vivosmart 4 i have had one previously and can't believe all of the extras included. You get sleep tracking, stress, heart rate etc everything you would want. I love the band size as its not as chunky as other watches. I would recommend the rose gold and grey it goes with everything!"", ""1.  Have large wrist and barely fits.  Quite uncomfortable.  Made for thin people not for large ones trying to get thin.2.  Tapping the display is not very responsive.3.  readouts disappear if you are not careful to tap in the right place.4.  I should have bought something simpler.  I'm not into tech in a significant way."", 'Ok but not as good as an earlier version of the watch. No where near as a responsive touch screen or identification of wrist movement to launch the screen post to view. Smaller size is more discrete. .', 'I upgraded from a Garmin 3 , for me it is important that I can use it for swimming and water fitness classes . the Garmin graphics on my iphone are great . I am very happy with my purchase . Marie :)', ""The app works poorly and service is zilch. I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it to others."", ""I find it needs re-charging every 3-4 days which can be inconvenient if I'm not near my computer"", 'This is my first watch tracker. I love my Garmin. Stylish as well. Great value.', 'Stopped charging after 3 months  now dead.', 'Wife likes it', 'Good quality', 'Very useful', 'This is a great product has all the feature I want and looks good. Easy to use', 'Ive had this item for a few months now, and initially thought it was amazing, loved the app and the graphs you can easily generate. Then I started realizing that it was VERY inaccurate with activities - it usually takes at least 25 minutes of walk/run to get it to detect activity, will only count a couple hundred steps after 45 minutes on a treadmill etc..... Ive tested step counts (walk 250 steps and check what it says) and it is often off by more than 20% (and up to 80%) - registering FEWER steps than taken. It very poorly detects stair climbs, and a staircase in a home usually doesnt register as stairs at all. Ive been up sick in the night multiple times for it to tell me I slept though soundly....I just cant trust the information it gives me at all which is disappointing - the look, comfort, and general function of the device are great. Still on the hunt for a tracker I can have confidence in.', ""I just received my Garmin Vivosmart 4 in grey with rose gold trim today and so far I love it!  Before I was using the Fitbit Flex device (shown in photo, black band).  By far the Garmin Vivosmart 4 is WAY better!  It reminds me to move every hour and can automatically detect when I'm working out, measures my heart rate, my personal energy battery, stress level and so much more data on the mobile app.  It also reminds me to breathe for mental wellness!The Fitbit app doesn't send me good notifications about low battery, so I often found out too late that I needed to recharge it and lost a lot of valuable data, and it doesn't remind you to move. The Garmin is slightly thinner than the Fitbit Flex and the same width, which I like.  I don't need or want a large Smartwatch.  I already own a regular watch, which I wear on the opposite arm.  To get better stats and insights on Fitbit, you have to pay a subscription for the Premium services.  All these great features on the Garmin are FREE!I don't mind the slight delay when I lift my wrist to check the Garmin when it switches from a dark screen to a lit one to show the time.  It's maybe a half second.  Some other reviewers found that annoying.  It doesn't bother me at all.  It does take a bit of time to learn how to find the menu item you're looking for, such as setting the exercise type.So far it seems to be fairly accurate.  It certainly seems more accurate today than my Fitbit when I did a workout.  The Fitbit seemed to under-report the number of steps, but the Garmin indicated the right amount of steps based on previous step counting of the same workout on previous days.I like that I can quickly check the weather and know the day of the week and date on first glance.Update: After 1 week and using this with cardio workouts, I still really love using this!  The screen can sometimes be unresponsive or with a long delay.  I think this happens when my finger has a bit of oil residue or the screen gets a little dirty.  It's not hard to clean the tiny screen, so it's ok.  I really appreciate the hourly reminders to get up and move, since I am working from home in front of a computer all day.  This helps reduce problems I was having with my neck and shoulders.  I also like the timer features on it, so I can do some quick workouts with each move being say 1 minute, then it buzzes when that minute is up so I can switch to the next move and restart the timer.  I find this easier than using a smart phone and needing to look at the time, picking up and putting down the phone each time the timer ends.  It has a stopwatch feature as well.  You can set a wake up alarm and it buzzes you when it's time to get up.This is the best value for a fitness tracker with so many great features like the pulse oximeter and the heart rate monitor, and so much more!"", 'When I received the watch I was very pleased. My wrists are small, to the appearance was not overpowering. However, after a month I noticed the accuracy of my steps was sometimes incorrect.I purchased the watch because of the rose gold band but recently noticed that fell completely right off when I was wearing it. It was $200 watch for something that only lasted a few months. Extremely disappointed. Should have invested a little more for a Fitbit or Apple Watch that would last longer then a few months.', ""I got this wearable because I have terrible anxiety and fatigue.I did a lot of reading and chose this specific model (vivosmart 4) for it's body battery feature, stress and heart rate monitors, and because it doesn't automatically acknowledge 'work outs' - since my heart rate shoots up for no reason, this means my watch doesn't think I'm running. Work outs can be selected manually, and the touch screen is responsive.I struggled with setup for a few minutes, (the pairing button didn't originally appear) but I just kept back opening the bluetooth settings and the button appeared! While the watch doesn't stay connected and synced all day long, it's easy to sync it by opening the app. I love the app.I should acknowledge that a few weeks after getting my watch, there was a ransomware attack. While a little concerning and inconvenient, the only noticeable impact was restricted access to the graphs. This wasn't really an issue though, because the Garmin app is SO THOROUGH. The graphs are colorful and easy to read, and provide a LOT of information. I personally prefer the graphs to those of competitor wearables :)I really can't speak highly enough of this watch. You get a LOT for your money."", ""Je n'est pas réussi à coupler la montre avec mon téléphone intelligent. Il me donnait  toujours un nouveau  code pour réessayer et c'était toujours échec.J'ai communiqué avec Garmin.Garmin nous répond seulement en Anglais.J'ai demandé qu'il me répondre en français.Ce n'était pas possible.Il me disait qu'il me donnait un rabais de $5.00 mais il fallait que je débourse $53.00 quelque chose comme ça pour avoir le service d'un technicien. Disons que je n'étais pas très contente. J'ai laissé la conversation.Je ne voulait pas débourser pour une montre neuve.Finalement je peux connecter la montre à l'ordinateur et tout fonctionne bien."", ""Je ne comprends pas pourquoi tout le monde se plaint de ce tracker sur internet... Il fonctionne franchement très bien la très grande majorité du temps. À part qu'il pense que je dors 5 minutes plus tard qu'en réalité (on peut ajuster cette info manuellement) et qu'il faut parfois se reprendre 2 fois pour allumer l'écran, je n'ai rien à redire. Mesures très précises. J'adore la fonction de réveil matin, celle de body battery et la variété d'indicateurs qu'on peut suivre pour les activités physiques. Les messages envoyés sont positifs et réalistes, ça donne réellement envie de bouger plus !"", ""I love how pretty it looks. Very sleek and the rose gold makes it just a bit fancier. I find this one to be more accurate than my last Garmin tracker. I don't like how difficult it is to bring up the stats. It stays off until I tap it  several times. It's supposed to sense when I move it to turn on and it doesn't or does it very randomly. The price was decent. It has several options to do things but I haven't tried much as the screen is touchy. Due to it being so sleek this makes it a downfall too. I do like how the messages work and I can actually see what it's saying. That was something I didn't like about my previous Garmin. Overall, I do like it. The best thing is how tough it is. It's been dropped and banged so many times and zero issues. The app is really easy to use and tracks accordingly. Sleep is the only thing that isn't accurately tracked. If I take it off or lay down it assume's I'm sleeping. I can sleep 4 hours and it will say I slept 11."", 'Diseño muy estético, combina con todo y se ve bonito.

Llevo dos semanas con él y estoy muy contenta. :)', ""well I received this watch today, was very excited about setting it up....I am not that versed in computer technology so it took me a while, but I would say, if you know what you're doing, it should be set up in mere moments.....love the colour, it looks very sleek and elegant and this grey band will go with mostly everything I wear.  the app is great, has a lot of features.....I'm excited to wear it to bed tonight, as I have asthma and I will be able to see what my oxygen levels are as I sleep.....Hopefully, I will wear this every day to keep me motivated to continue with my health and wellness plan.I have only rated this as a 3, as I just got it....but I am optimistic those ratings will climb....So, its a couple months since I bought the Garmin.  I do love it.  I don't think I could be without it now.  There are a lot of activities on this garmin watch.  I find it sleek and nice looking.  The app took a while to set up, but once I got it up and running, I have had no problems.  I previously had a fitbit, for over 6 years, however I have to say, I prefer this little Garmin.  The only down side, is it can take a few taps on it, to see the time.  Unlike the fitbit, the face does not continuously show the time.....Otherwise, I'd buy it again, and will recommend it for anyone, even an old timer like myself.....changing rating to a 4"", 'Después de varios meses de uso me ha gustado. Es sencillo de utilizar y da información relevante. La app se me hizo.medio confusa en un principio. Lo uso diario y lo pongo a cargar dos veces por senana. La carga es rápida, un par de horas y listo. Lo que me.molesta es que continuamente pierde la conexión con el teléfono y hay que enlazarlos.

It's super light and auto turns on workouts if I'm hiking or walking fast and tracks it. The Garmin app is so insightful and I'm addicted to setting challenges with friends. Most importantly it's getting me moving more, which was the purpose."", ""The Good:Nice, slim bracelet design for those who don't want a huge watch. Garmin app for iOS is very well designed, with info layout better than Apple's built-in Health app.The Not-Good:When the Garmin is asleep, the display is insensitive to touches/taps/swipes/wrist-rolls and invariably takes several tries before you can wake it up. This is annoying when you want to quickly check your heart rate while walking, let's say. Also, the watch faces are very limited in what info you'd like to have displayed by default."", 'LA aplicación en la parte del sueño viene solo la gráfica y no puedo ver los valores por hora.

Many holes to use for sizing.

Certo, sarebbe stato fornito con tutto il bagaglio della durata della batteria del sistema operativo Wear e altre stranezze del sistema operativo stesso, ma colmate tuttavia da un enorme (e crescente) gap nella gamma Suunto che hanno musica, mappe , app e pagamenti.Non appena ricevuto ho realizzato come questo SUUNTO 7 fosse realizzato in China a differenza di SUUNTO 9 che e' prodotto in Finlandia. Un vero dispiacere vedere questa decisione da casa SUUNTO.Arriva nella solita scatola Suunto.L'orologio e' avvolto attorno ad un cilindro di cartone. Sotto vi e' un documento che ti racconta l'eredità di Suunto nell'avventura. All'interno del cilindro di cartone è presente il caricabatterie.Il caricabatterie è diverso da qualsiasi altro prodotto Suunto del passato. Include un magnete per mantenere il caricabatterie saldamente collegato all'orologio durante la ricarica.Suunto 7 pesa 67 g a differenza di altri brand come l'Apple Watch Series 5 che pesa 67 g e di Suunto 9 che pesa 81 g.Mi piace molto il peso e la sensazione del Suunto 7.Il miglior motivo per scegliere il Suunto 7 è francamente il fantastico quadrante che hanno incluso che mostra le mappe di calore.E' del tutto personalizzabile è infatti possibile modificare il livello di zoom in/out, nonché modificare il tipo di mappa di calore (sci alpino, nuoto, corsa, bici e tanti altri).Tramite il GPS lo smartwatch scarica automaticamente le heat maps quando viaggi in una nuova area.Se per qualche motivo le mappe di calore non vi piacciono, e' possibile scaricare molti quadranti Suunto aggiuntivi dall'app Wear OS o caricarli tramite il Play Store sull'orologio.In termini di luminosità, lo schermo è facilmente leggibile all'interno e all'esterno.⌚️ Wear OS:Premendo il pulsante in alto a sinistra si aprirà il programma di avvio delle app, consentendoti di avviare le app scaricate (o preinstallate) o di installarne di nuove tramite il Play Store. Ciò è notevole, poiché qui non è necessaria alcuna interazione telefonica per sfogliare / installare app.⚽️Sport:Il monitoraggio delle attivita' sportive è interamente ospitato all'interno dell'App Suunto dove e' possibile monitorare tra i 60 e gli 80 sports.Oltre all'app, ci sono sia alcuni widget molto utili aggiunti da Suunto come il diario di allenamento o la visualizzazione in modalita' calendario.🎧 Musica:Un altro motivo per cui acquistare questo smartwatch e' la musica.Suunto 7 supporta due tipi di musica principali:1. Piattaforme di streaming (come Google Music o Spotify)2. Musica caricata manualmente (come MP3 o simili)E' possibile associare delle cuffie bluetooth e lasciare il telefono a casa.Comodo anche il widget dei controlli multimediali che permette di mettere in pausa o cambiare canzone direttamente dall'orologio.❤️ Monitoraggio della frequenza cardiaca:INUTILE, è impossibile avere la frequenza istantanea. A differenza praticamente di qualsiasi altro orologio che ho testato negli ultimi anni, il Suunto 7 è completamente inutile per il monitoraggio della frequenza cardiaca 24h/7. Con il campionamento solo ogni 15 minuti (se tutto va bene), è difficile estrarre eventuali tendenze significative, oltretutto i dati vengono visualizzati solo all'interno della povera app Google Fit e non della piattaforma di Suunto. Questo e' un grosso punto a sfavore.📡 GPS:Dal punto di vista della precisione del GPS ho trovato il Suunto 7 abbastanza al passo degli altri smartwatch, non è certo un Suunto Ambit, ma sembra buono quanto un Suunto 3/5/9 dal punto di vista GPS per i luoghi e le aree che ho testato.Pecca molto grande qui è l'impossibilità di caricare percorsi/itinerari personalizzati (o gpx).🔋 Batteria:ASSOLUTAMENTE NO, ho monitorato attentamente la durata della mia batteria ogni giorno con il Suunto 7 e sono emerse diverse criticità.Le prime 24 ore dopo averlo impostato sono un inferno, la batteria si scarica molto velocemente. Migliora leggermente dopo qualche giorno dove in generale, otterrai circa 20-28 ore di autonomia della batteria in standby se utilizzi le impostazioni predefinite su Suunto 7, con un tipico allenamento di 1 ora al giorno. Solo in modalita' standby con notifiche attive si riesce a raggiungere 36 ore di utilizzo (circa 1 giorno e mezzo).I tempi di ricarica sono abbastanza rapidi, circa 90 minuti per una carica completa da 0 a 100.💰 Prezzo:Sicuramente non e' un prodotto alla portata di tutte le tasche e 499 euro e' un prezzo leggermente sproporzionato rispetto a quello che il prodotto offre.300 euro sarebbe stato un giusto compromesso (personalmente acquistato a 392 euro in offerta).Non lo ricomprerei, piuttosto andrei sul Suunto 9.Facendo una piccola comparazione con gli altri prodotti Suunto:Suunto 3 (199 euro): orologio di base senza GPS per il rilevamento delle attività;Suunto 5 (329 euro): fa quasi tutto GPS senza un altimetro barometricoSuunto 7 (499 euro): orologio Wear OS con quasi tutte le funzionalità di Suunto 9 (manca ad esempio il monitoraggio del sonno)Suunto 9 (599 euro)"", ""Buscaba lo mejor de los 2 mundos (Polar Sports + WearOS).Con el último update está muy cerca de conseguirlo pero a su actual precio con la potencia justa de su procesador, se queda lamentablemente corto. Hasta que no aparezca un procesador más potente para WearOS no llegaremos a ese punto.El diseño y la calidad del material me gusta mucho, la pantalla es brillante y grande, la batería con el último update aguanta muy bien el 'always on', la pulsera cómoda y de calidad.¿Qué mas le falta para mi gusto?1. Altavoz y que pueda gestionar llamadas (igual que Fossil Carlyle).  Y que Google Assistant funcione de verdad.2. Contador de pisos (igual que mi Garmin VA4)3. Botón corona para seleccionar (como Fossil Carlyle) es un nice to have.4. El sensor muy salido del HR se clava en la piel. Eso ya no sucede con los últimos sport smartwaches que han ido saliendo.He tenido ya muchos smartwatches de todo tipo, me faltaba Suunto, pero debido a su precio frente a la ausencia  de los puntos que describo arriba he decidido volver a mi VA 4 mientras no salga otro candidato potente con el sport tracking + WearOS (para la perfecta integración de mi ecosistema google)."", 'Vengo de un Suunto spartan sport whr y la verdad es que este dispositivo me ha decepcionado. Es bonito, con materiales de calidad. Puedes bajar aplicaciones (un montón de esferas, una que te hace de disparador a distancia de la cámara del móvil...) puedes oir música sin el móvil y sobre todo, seguir rutas en mapas de mucha calidad, pero la batería no soporta todo esto, así que al final terminas poniendo una esfera que economice batería, oyes la música en el móvil  y tienes la wifi y el bluetooth siempre apagado, y aún así, la batería apenas te aguanta cuatro horas en ruta.¿Te comprarías un descapotable con motor V8, asientos de cuero y un equipo de música descomunal si luego no puedes circular con la capota abierta y la música puesta a la vez, o si el V8 no lo pudieras usar con los asientos de cuero? Mejor el spartan, que es más ""espartano"" pero con una batería que soporta lo que te ofrece...', 'Da mich die GPS Genauigkeit der Fenix 6 Serie nicht überzeugt hat, gab ich der Suunto 7 eine Chance.ABER, eigene oder in die App importierte GPX files werden zwar in der App angezeigt, können aber nicht auf die Suunto 7 übertragen werden! Was mache ich bitte mit einer Smartwatch die die Navigation als Hauptfeature hat, ich aber keine eigenen Routen verwenden kann?!Schade, da Bedienung der Map auf der Uhr selbst (also zoom, verschieben, etc), nicht nur über den Touchscreen (den es ja bei der Fenix Serie leider noch immer nicht gibt), sondern auch über die Tasten, um einiges eingängiger wäre, als bei Garmin.Unglaublich so etwas in den Verkauf zu bringen, zumal ich den technischen Hintergrund nicht verstehen kann, also heatmaps gehen, importierte Routen nicht -> warum? ...*** UPDATE - Okt.2020 ***Suunto hat nun endlich nachgebessert und das mache ich nun auch mit meiner Bewertung...Seit dem letzten Update, kann man endlich auch eigene Routen auf die Smartwatch übertragen, bravo, so hätte es gleich sein sollen!Die Akkulaufzeit hat sich auch etwas verbessert, wirklich berühmt ist sie aber leider noch immer nicht, das liegt aber wohl eher an Wear OS, als an Suunto selbst.In Summe steigt für mich nun die Bewertung von einem auf drei Sterne, der Vierte ist in Reichweite, mal sehen ob es mit zukünftigen Updates eventl. noch besser wird ...', 'Sind Sie Taucher, Profi-Sportler oder Bergfex, gehören also zur typischen Klientel von Suunto? Dann rate ich Ihnen sich nach einer anderen Uhr umzusehen. Ebenso sollten Sie eine andere Uhr wählen wenn Sie ihre Gesundheits- und Vitaldaten tracken wollen.  Solllten Sie jedoch auf der Suche nach einer alltagstauglichen Smartwatch sein mit welcher Sie ihr mehrmals die Woche wiederkehrendes Workout tracken und analysieren können dann ist die  Suunto 7 durchaus eine überlegenswerte und gute Option.Doch der Reihe nach und etwas ausführlicher:ARMBAND:Es ist zwar nicht ungewöhnlich dem Armband bei einer Uhrenrezension einen eigenen Punkt zu widmen, mit diesem Punkt zu beginnen jedoch schon. Dennoch möchte ich diese Rezension mit dem Punkt Armband beginnen. Ganz einfach deshalb weil ich die Version mit 2 Armbändern gewählt habe, nämlich mit einem grauen Silikonarmband und einem grauen Mikrofasertextilarmband. Und ja, das Textilarmband sieht durchaus stylisch aus und verleiht der Suunto 7 einen nobleren Touch, welcher nicht ganz so nach Sportuhr aussieht, was zu manchen Anlässen durchaus  praktisch ist. Was letztendenlich auch der Grund war, weshalb ich mich für diese Variante entschieden habe, zummal ich eine Führungsposition bekleide. Dennoch habe ich das vormontierte Textilarmband relativ schnell durch das Silikonarmband ausgetrauscht, was dank heute eigentlich üblichen Schnellwechselmechanismus schnell, problemlos und ohne Werkzeug von Statten geht.Ganz einfach deshalb weil das sich Textilaarmband zumindest nicht für schweißtreibende Workouts eignet da es aufgrund mangelnder Beschichtung an der Innenseite ziemlich schnell ziemlich unansehlich würde. Zudem ist das  Material des Textilarmbandes sehr dünn, sodaß ich mich des Eindrucks nicht erwehren kann dass es sich zimlich schnell abnutzt und früher oder später reißt. Aufgrund desSehr weichen aber rauen Materials ist es weiterhin auch ein Geduldsspiel die eine Armbandseite beim Anlegen der Uhr durch die Lachen zur Fixierung zu buxieren.Das Silikonarmband hingegen ist äusserst robust und pflegeleicht und gibt auch sonst keinerlei Anlass zur Kritik, ist allerdings zumindest für Opernbesuche oder festliche Anlässe nicht erste Wahl.AKKU:Der Akku ist bei allen Smart- und Sportwatches die Achilllesferse, und nein auch die Suunto 7 macht hier keine Außnahme. Wobei das nur die halbe Wahrheit ist, zumindest für eine Wear OS Smartwatch mit GPS hat die Suunto 7 ein sehr sehr hohes Durchhaltevermögen. Konkret heißt das, dass die Suunto 7 nach einem 16 Stundentag, mit 2 Workouts von jeweils ca. 60 Minuten inklusive Tracking und GPS über die Suunto App, diversen Notificationen, 6 Timernutzungen, 3 Atemübungen und ansonsten der üblichen Displaykonfiguration noch 32% Akkuladung hatte. Was mehr als respektabel ist jedoch dazu führt, dass man die Suunto 7 bei normaler Nutzung wohl einmal am Tag geladen werden muss. Allerdings dauert der Ladevorgang 32% auf 100% nur etwas mehr als eine gute Stunde. Der  Hersteller gibt für eine Komplettladung einer Dauer von 100 Minuten an, was durchaus glaubhaft erscheint.SOFTWEAR:Dank Wear OS kann die Suunto 7 mit einer nahezu endlosen Anzahl Apps individualisiert und diversen Funktionalitäten wie Schlaftracking, Wettervorhersage, Ziffernblättern (auf der Uhr sind 4 Suunto Ziffernblääter, darunter das abgebildte mit den Heatmaps, sowie das Google Fit Ziffernblatt vorinstalliert) ausgestattet werden.Mit der Suunto App können wie gewohnt eine Vielzahl (derzeit 70) an Sportarten getrackt werden, wobei im Gegensatz zu den anaderen Suunto-Sportuhren manche Parameter nicht abgebildet werden, welche das ggf sind wir auf der offiziellen Suunto Website en Detail dargestellt. Für die üblichen Sportarten wie Laufen, Gehen, Radfahren und Schwimmen, etc. reicht es nicht nur allemal, sondern es bleiben keinerlei Wünsche offen.HARDWARE, STEUERUNG und SENSOREN:Die Suunto 7 verfügt neben einem NFC-Chip der unteranderme erlaubt per Google-Pay mit der Uhr in vuiuelen Einzeklhandelsgeschäften zu zahlen nur noch über einen optischen Sensor zur Pulsmessung am Handgelenk, welcher jedoch sehr verlässliche und genaue Ergebnisse liefert. Die messung der zurückgelegten Höhenmeter erfolgt jedoch leider nur über GPS jedoch nicht über einen verbauten Sensor zur Höhenmesssung, somit können auch die täglich zurückgelegten Stockwerke nicht getrackt werden, was für eine moderne und Zeitgemäße Fitness-Uhr eigentlich ein absolutes Must ist.Ein weiteres No-Go für eine Smartwatch in dieser Preisklasse ist auch, dass die Suunto weder über Mikrofon nocht Lautsprecher verfügt, womit sie sich nicht nur nicht zum telefonieren eignet, was ich persönlich verschmerzen kann. Leider stehen auch für Timer und Wecker keine akkustischen Signale zur Verfügung, die entsprechenden Alarme werden also lediglich über Vibrationsalarm mitgeteilt, weshalb man die Uhr zu solchen Gelegenheiten auch immer am Handgelenk tragen muss, was zumindest bei der Nutzung als  Wecker etwas lästig ist, schließlich will die Uhr ja auch geladen werden, wofür sich natürlich die Nacht anbietet.Der TOUCHSCREEN reagiert sehr genau und ausreichend aber eben auch nicht zu sensiebel, hier hat Suunto im Gegensatz zuvielen anderen Smartwacht-Herstellern seine Sache wirklich gut gemacht. Lediglich bei Minusgraden kommt es zu teilweisen Reaktionsverzögerungen.Selbstverständlich lassen sich die Grundfunktionen der Suunto 7 nicht nur über das Display steuern, sondern auch über 4 Physische Tasten, von denen zwei im Grundmodus für den Schnellzugriff frei belegbar sind.Der Touchscreen besteht wie heute eigentlich schon fast State of the Art bei Sportuhren, aus widerstandsfähigem Gorillaglas.KONNEKTIVITÄT:Die Bluetooth-Verbindung mit dem Smartphone ist ebenso absolut stabil wie die Verbindung mit dem heimischen WLAN welche sich bei Bedarf automatisch aktiviert um beim Ladevorgang die neuesten Offlinekarten auf die Uhr zu laden oder auch die neuesten Updates. Leider wurde das letzte Update (am gestrigen Tage) jedoch nicht auf die Uhr geladen, als diese auf der Ladestation lag sondern als ich diese am Handgelenk getragen habe, was nicht nur den Akku massiv geschawächt hat, nämlich etwa 45 (!)% sondern auch dazu, dass sich das Update wohl auch aufgehängt hat, weil ich zwischendurch den WLAN-Bereich verlassen hatte und auch mein Smartphone in der TG keinen Empfang hat. Als ich das Problem bemerkt habe, habe ich die Suunto 7 auf der Ladestationgeparkt und das Update erneut manuel heruntergeladen und installiert. Eigentlich kein großes Ding aber dennoch ärgerlich, nicht nur bei einer Uhr dieser Preisklasse.Und auch bei der Bluetoothverbindung gibt es zumindest in meinem Fall Anlass zur Kritik  führt diese doch zu kurzen Abbrüchen zwischen meinem Galaxy S10+ und meinen geliebten Libratone TRACK Air+ Earbuds. Jedoch hat die Suunto 7 weder auf die Verbindung zwischen Smartphone und meinen JBL-Sportbuds noch auf die Verbindung mit meinen B&O H9 Overears einen negativen Einfluss, sodaß ich dies nur der Vollständigkeithalber erwähnen möchte.FAZIT:Ja, ich habe in dieser Rezension einige Kritikpunkte an der Suunto 7 erwähnt, jedoch sind die vergebenen 4 Sterne dennoch gerechtfertigt, ganz einfach deshalb weil es auch an anderen Smart- und Sportwatches (Ich bin stolzer Besitzer einiger Modelle von Garmin, darunter eine Fenix der neuesten Generation, einer Scanwatch und einer Sport HR von Withings, einer Samsung Smartwatch aus dem Jahre 2019, einer Falster 3 von Skagen und dem Schwestermodellen von Fossil und Diesel, und meine Frau besitzt neben einer Applewatch auch noch zwei Modelle von Fitbit) den einen oder anderen teilweise schwerwiegenderen Kritikpunkt gibt.Das Gesamtpaket der Suunto 7 konnte mich jedoch im Alltag absolut überzeugen, ist sie doch eine Gelungene Symbiose aus Smartwatch, mit all den entsprechenden Funktionalitäten, und einer Sportuhr die zumindest für den ambitionierten Hobbysportler einen mehr als ausreichenden Trackingumfang bietet, wobei die Ergebnisse sehr genau sind und auch das GPS-Signal in 90% der Fälle umgehend und ohne Verzögerung gefunden wird, was bei anderen Uhren alles andere als selbstverständlich ist.Insofern möchte ich die Suunto 7 all jenen  ans Herz legen, welche auf der Suche nach einer Smartwatch sind, welche nicht nur absolut zuverlässig im Alltag funktioniert, sondern ebenso zuverlässig jedwede sportliche Aktivität trackt.', ""Je me suis laissé tenté par le couple Wear OS et Suunto qui sur le papier permet d'avoir une montre connectée avec des vraies fonctions sportives.Malheureusement, le résultat est mauvais.Le principal problème c'est l'autonomie de la montre qui est tout juste de 24h d'autonomie. Mon ancienne montre (Garmin Vivoactive 3)  a 4 jours d'autonomie.Suunto annonce jusqu'à 2 jours d'autonomie c'est impossible à atteindre.Ensuite la montre est trop compliquée, mélange Wear OS + Suunto, trop de boutons (complexité liée à Wear OS).3 applications nécessaires sur le téléphone :- Wear OS- Suunto- Google FitDes incompréhensions entre la partie Google & SuuntoPar exemple il y a un double comptage des pas :Via Suunto et via Google Fit et un écart entre 10 & 20% entre les 2 (Google Fit compte moins de pas que Suunto)Autre point, Je trouvais intéressant de pouvoir utiliser Google Pay sur la montre mais ça impose de mettre un code sur la montre (imposé par Google Pay) et dès qu'on enlève la montre (pour la charger) il faut taper le code pin. du coup j'ai désactivé Google Pay.Sur la partie sportive, la montre met plus de temps à trouver les satellites que Garmin : 30s environ pour ma Garmin Vivoactive contre 2 min pour la Suuntoensuite j'ai eu un plantage de l'appli Suunto en courantConcernant les fonctions annexes :Chez Suunto, il n'est pas possibilité de tracker les km parcourus avec les chaussures (fonction disponible depuis toujours chez Garmin)Je ne trouve pas de site web pour voir les activités (seule une appli sur le téléphone)Conclusion : déception totale !!! Comment une marque renommée comme Suunto peut oser ventre cette montre surtout pour un prix hors promo de 450€ !Du coup après une semaine d'utilisation, j'ai capitulé. je retourne la montre et là comme d'habitude je donne 5 étoiles pour le service client Amazon.""]"
